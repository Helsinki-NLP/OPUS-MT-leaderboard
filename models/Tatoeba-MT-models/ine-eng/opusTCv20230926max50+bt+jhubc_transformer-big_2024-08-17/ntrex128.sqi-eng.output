Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they "look like fools"
A concern has spread among some of the Assembly's members over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This came as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could incite ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "cookie".
A Welsh MP said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the verb "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the verb "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to announce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of the Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the tagrin to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latter's proposal for the appointment of the Assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found widespread support.
Regarding the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the designation "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a public consultation.
As it turns out, Assembly members are suggesting alternative elections, but the fight for consensus could turn into a headwind for President Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce legislation on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the Members of the Assembly.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province of its own called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has said he will not recognise the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face difficulties
“Historically, the elderly people I’ve talked to say it’s been from a bar and from a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"They're both missing."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“These days, people socialize in other ways,” he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the property would not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential palaces full of people who will not support the holy sites that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will close once and for all, as it is unlikely that most of the people who settle in these homes will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of people of color, who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of people of color under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority merchants on 125th Street, a main street of shops in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carrion "the bell of the poor people."
The expert who played in the carriage in July called it something completely different: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that this was the first career in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger career at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some sent by lay church leaders and others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The council - the leading body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, worrying that it would "try to transfer costs" to the parish council, despite the latter not being involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Diving to Catch Squirrels in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch sea urchins in California on the opening day of the sea urchin season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then drove towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought the boy was just excited by the capture of some beetle, but then "I realized he was screaming 'Bite me!
It bites me!"
Hammel states that when he reached the boy, he saw that his entire clavicle was torn.
"I cried out to everyone coming out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Rady's" in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was defined as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a staff of specialized retailers.
As part of a significant effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK cosmetics market, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion apparel and home furnishings are slumped, the largest cosmetic pavilions will be tested at the country's 11 boutiques and stores.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and home furnishings.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offer of up to 3,000 cosmetic products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even the existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to the respective brands, similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will once again launch its boutique cosmetics line, so that most of the products will be vegan-based - something that is increasingly being demanded by buyers of younger ages.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while a second is expected to open later this year at Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying food in small quantities in the neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that outlets will start to resemble larger stores more and more as the supermarket chain struggles to combat price cuts from Aldi and Lidl with more services and joint products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced a range of "Habitats" since buying the two networks two years ago, which he says has boosted food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a merger of companies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke up after a debate over how to split revenue from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination of luxury, which makes a difference to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'ghosted' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left "giantly" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV."
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of home furnishings and “truly” accessories.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" host turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the "Dragons Den" star, Peter Jones, after withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "giant" when the golden girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had the time to mark their home for good.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was expected to double its estimated assets to the value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, approached Instagram to announce her departure from "Truely", Jones flew outside the UK to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw left all the people involved absolutely horrified.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to opening.
In the offices of Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, could cost the firm millions, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to household clothes and furnishings, and cause it to delay further.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
The couple spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
It's a tough conversation, and then we fall in love.
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of a comment he made, which some would describe as "not worthy of a president," and because of the positivity surrounding North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the voice of the news anchors.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "corresponding response" from the U.S. to the North's first steps taken by the Korean Peninsula.
On the contrary, he says, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping pressure on.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea," he said.
"We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping missile testing, assisting in the release of hostages and returning home the rest of the U.S. military.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, which is a precondition for the catalyzing of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear on many occasions that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Given Indonesia's frequent land shakes, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of nature's wrath.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hard to come by in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of the tsunami in Palu, despite having issued a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
The natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has used Indonesia's key infrastructure improvement as a focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have worried Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections to be held next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes following clashes between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where hangars, bows and arrows, and other cold weapons have been used.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has scored a goal in the last few minutes against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball slightly to his left before making a blow towards the far gate.
The ball flew over the area as it swerved to the right and top of the net.
The ball escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga's air jump and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls in front, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with one touch and I didn't think long but I just hit.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward made a replay of Mateo Kovacic during that game, before spinning near the pitch and sprinting towards Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick combination in midfield.
He then gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense in a speeding duel and with a left-footed shot scored on the second pole, passing the ball behind the wings of Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the rubble of buildings torn down by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo's spokesman said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is believed to be under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman found dead from knife wound
An investigation into the murder was announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call on anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
"I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught footage, to contact us as they may have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a flat.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived on the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, while police have said they are notifying the victim's family members.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out about the incident.
Now, residents are being notified that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived at the scene of the crime.
She keeps repeating the words, "This is terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside it.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a live @MerPolCC message, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by dialing the code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the most recent monument affected by the debate on "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a bribe" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "Amid the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable to sign Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a sacrifice of Cromwell's wrong for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Pig Killer Injures Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", has been found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pig stall in Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer gets ready to inject the swine vaccine at a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a pigsty nearby.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth in the stable.
A medical examination has confirmed that a <0xC2><0xA3>550 pig has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and bruised,” said his identified cousin with the surname “Wu,” as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has confessed to the evening's news that the pig had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been noted before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing her husband severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig caught a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, while his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that usually, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “stimulant.”
"They just want to play.
They're like very curious little boys... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring large-scale rainfall to the U.S. Southwest.
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is softening as it moves toward the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause rainfall resulting in flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa was accompanied by winds of 85 miles per hour, classified as a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form an area of low atmospheric pressure, which is moving eastwards, toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the face of a tropical storm, she will continue to push southwards to wet the tropics.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rainfall of up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low atmospheric pressure area will cause heavy rains over the next few days with wide expanses in the Southwest.
At the local level, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches high will cause immediate flooding, waste runoff, and potential landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mostly over a large portion of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
Due to the risk of tropical rains, it is not advisable to drive through the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the straits will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The affluence of the low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of California's southern coast.
The total level of precipitation can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste streams and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rains of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, before rain showers extend to Monday and Tuesday evenings.
The heavy rains will spread across the four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by large temperature fluctuations, with temperatures dropping in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures over short distances.
A good example is the dramatic temperature difference across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to launch in October at warm temperatures, averaging 80, from the Southern to certain parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high odds of temperatures above the U.S. average in the eastern half of October.
More than 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters stopped regular programs to broadcast the turnaround at the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it hadn't happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been higher than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Figures for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football eliminator or to that of the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, topped other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the end of the trial.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced outcry from protesters as he tried to climb into the elevator to go to the courtroom.
On CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was reprimanded.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have the power, but there are so many weak women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote on Kavanaugh's passage of the candidacy for a vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without carrying out the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing political games' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the newspaper's main page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy taxes on each other is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and interrogated in prison premises on charges of premeditated murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department has said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have found the glasses at the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted that he had fired a gun on Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Office of the Medical Examiner of the Eastern Townships of Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department thanks the task force of the fugitives near the Louisiana State Police, the state police forensics laboratory, Southern University police, and the area's citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest of the author.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for "their zeal and for putting justice in place."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall, 6-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
The volcano is pouring out over the city of Mexico.
The eruption of the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was resurfaced and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring a series of tremors and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ashes covering the car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peacekeepers, while thousands have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote to secede.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder paint creating dark clouds of dust through the streets that are usually muddy by tourists.
Later in the day, there were also beatings, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For several hours at a time, repeating the slogan “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, pro-independence groups faced union protesters shouting “Greet Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiment prevails, tensions remain high for another year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, despite the fact that participation was low, as citizens against secession boycotted the votes.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take another turn.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that in last December's local elections they achieved a vital victory, although with a narrow result, Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time keeping the hovin this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in detention and awaiting trial for their role of organizing and appointing.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone to help police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, said he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The casting of the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the oppression that has been done to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after car collides with home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car collided several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is believed that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's strike forgives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team tied for second-place Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But first, the Rangers will wait at home for Rapid Vienna in the Europa League final on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended the series of consecutive wins in six games and coach Holt hasn't experienced the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses the case against the undecided opponents.
Holt's team should have taken the lead many minutes before they scored, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but struck weakly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow struck out on the slide after Craig Halkett's header.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard shots.
And that's how the goal was set.
The Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the opportunity for Menga, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball but the domestic defense had proved unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost never been put to the test.
This game continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped on foot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor as Lithgow struck out from another standard Livingston shot.
The raids continued to take place in the Livingston area and were continuously cleared, while the two claims for the penalty - after Halkett's intervention against the player who came in as Glenn Middleton's replacement, and another for hand-to-hand touch - were not taken into consideration.
The game 'Fenomenale' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great performance and a great result for Livingston.
For a man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed expectations on this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a great credit goes to Holt for the way he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under the direction of Gerrard, they lacked quality.
The final pass was missing - only once did they manage to pass the opposing defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is expected to have mixed feelings in Colombia.
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by a blue-sky smile as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning in Berlin.
This was the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed to settle relations between NATO allies.
They have clashed over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but still many supporters took to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshipped as a hero by some Turks of Germany and despised as autocrats by some others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the emergency responders arrived immediately, but the victim died on the scene.
The crash came a few months after another cyclist died in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred on Childers Street, about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and alert his family members.
Roads have been closed and buses have been announced to use other roads, while vehicle drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During a Rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The rebellion broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and is still going on.
Specialist officers of Tornado have been called in to keep the unrest under control, which includes eight inmates and who are confined within one wing of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for some minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Prison staff with specialized training have been mobilized to keep under control the incident currently taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that those responsible will refer to the police and may receive an extension of the prison sentence.”
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had undergone treatment at the hospital after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police force were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which may be an advantage for drought areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, most likely this is exactly what will happen in the first few days of next week as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the route to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching in the late hours of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at levels 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas out of danger of immediate flooding, Rosa's rainfall could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these rainfalls may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for Drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme Category 2 droughts.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is battling cold waters over the Pacific Ocean, and as a result, power is being lost.
As a result, the hurricane is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico may be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Rainfalls of an average level of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the wake of a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday morning.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or its aftermath is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the Northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations are expected to cause immediate life-threatening flooding, waste runoff in the desert, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Murder Remained in Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of murder remaining in the attempt, after a 16-year-old was stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "stable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for the presentation of anyone who may have captured a video footage of the event by mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "faced the disgrace and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "faced the disgrace and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, convincingly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that the day "the American people testified to Kavanaugh's greatness, character qualities, and courage."
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most thoughtful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during a speech on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
"I'm not going to run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"That's why I'm making so much effort and fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to make "resistance and blockade."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them by the giant waves that hit the beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high collided on the beach in the mud, devouring and causing the deaths of many people and destroying everything that was going on.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, told a news conference.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it took cars, cars, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed the tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors after the quake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is at the end of a long, narrow breast, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "large enough" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the extent of the damage could be much greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication networks "were completely shut down without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised for failing to give notice of Palu's tsunami hit, despite officials saying the waves had come at the time the warning was given.
In amateur films distributed on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the way down to the arrival of the tsunami with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave collides on the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aided cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees continue to have large needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is quite severe.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin (rubber cloth) shelters in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite severe.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to set in motion humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the regional level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been given.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing persons were still hoping that the case of their loved ones would be one of those few miracles that sometimes happen in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a well.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national parachuting team, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an old professional in the field of parachuting, I am very emotionally charged,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse among the parachuting community, he had tried desperately to write on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended with only one grayscale sign, rather than the two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during the restocking of an ATM in Newport, Levee.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was filling a bank account in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the vehicle had been dumping a cash machine at an entertainment center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "runs after Brink's employee" and steals a bag of cash destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen some suspects fleeing the scene, but police have not specified the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West to change name to 'Ye'
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has long been nicknamed Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which hit the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who can't come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current art name, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning to it.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "alone," to simply "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he stated that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a dividing visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist movements of students were rising up across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving students monthly grants and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount spent on research in this field, says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came as various parts of the U.S. government have announced AI discoveries, despite the U.S. missing an official overall artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Disguising the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in this field," Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book titled “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” which was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence+ companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed to the U.S. lead player at Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee congratulated the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get grants from the government.
“It’s not China that is taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired minds enlightened by universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that green cards should be automatically given to people with a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Science Foundation in China provides funding for individuals in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to decide whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts to join NATO and join the Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will reach the 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will adhere to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing a chair in front of the tents erected by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t like us by the name of Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma, found that 57 percent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced off against all of Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker took a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He broke through Brighton's three defenders before heading out into the open.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several others in the speed duel at the entrance to the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker took advantage of his exit into the area to follow the Agueros ball, which hit with the right and overtook goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball at the right corner of the net.
“Aguero is suffering from a foot problem,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about whether he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the opening lead in the Premier League game.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball into Brighton's half-field.
He looked good for Laroy Sane on his left arm.
Sane advanced a few steps before moving on to Sterling in the second pillar.
The blue striker led the ball into the net and then slipped out of the bounding lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to keep the role of the "predator" against the Rockies
With Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the qualifiers, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff opportunity for the Rockies, who have an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies reached at least one playoff opportunity thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to take the division title.
"Even though we are playing for no reason, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level that I can face throughout the year.
"Why wouldn't I want to play in a game like this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to leave Scherzer to start the meeting in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would have been 34th for the title, held a training session on Thursday and could be on the pitch on Sunday, which could be a normal day off for him.
The player from Washington, who shoots with the right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 of shots this season.
Trump gathers West Virginian at rally
The president referred back to the situation regarding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, before speaking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"It's crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates."
Trump continued, "You see this awful bunch of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided the mind to regain power in any way, you see their humiliation and severity.
They don’t want to know who they’re hurting, who they’re pushing to take power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "resistance and blockade".
"And you've seen this in the last few days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, cruel, dirty and faithless."
He referred to the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee, prompting cheers from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you publish the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, no, I... wait a minute... her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an “open church”.
She's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of no confidence in me, I wasn't so surprised.
After all, I'm not the first of the Labour Party MPs to be told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy fell in opposition to previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year term as a local Labour Party MP, the GC meetings have been just that.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their former tone, and the promise of a "softer and kinder" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180-degree turn and hold positions with which I would never have agreed - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - social media criticism explodes, with people demanding my dismissal, denouncing the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me that suffered.
I am aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an “open church,” and with every motion of confidence and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised often to keep my head down, not to be so noisy, and that so everything “will be fine”.
But that's not why I'm into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by the disregard of Thatcher's government that led my class to failure at a general school, I've tried to lobby for better public services for those most in need - whether as a government member of a local council or as a mini-council.
"I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had my political views and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted in favour of the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise you that no threat to dismissal or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr tops the charts
The two delayed attempts may have somewhat changed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They now top the list as the only undefeated team out of ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that ensured the victory for the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was completely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so normally I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, which took more risks than we did.
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, turned into a goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came in for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show off the numerical superiority of Morty and Jago.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and returned to goal an individual action leading the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose did well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a goal by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then, there was a long break as a result of severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left with a barrel, and after the restart of the game, Ayr increased the score through a Stafford McDowall attempt, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then penalized with a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had one more player, with an unreturned goal attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pending piece.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card for obstructing Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made "touch down", behind Ayr's triple-back (maul) advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward attacking player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
The star of "Still Game" seems determined for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears determined to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, with co-writer and co-star Greg Hemphill, his long-time partner in the comedy world.
The duo have announced that season nine will be the final season for the show, and it appears Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source for Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to get into Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going out to sea hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling an improvised naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a task."
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile's coastal takeover in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been in decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling after a five-year review.
“Bolivia is characterized by howi, the spirit of unity and calmness, and of course, is waiting with positivity for the result,” said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for a second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is quite important.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he pledged in late August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if, they would change very little.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no intention of giving another state part of Chile's territory, and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is coming out with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "wasn't complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the past four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has wiped out every trace of kindness left in the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's ruling was surprisingly quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disagreements, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place as long as it can't be trusted by the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never be the first to crack down on nuclear weapons, as long as it can't trust Washington.
Ri was giving a speech on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between leaders of rival countries.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reviving so far “sleepy” nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, hopes that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees are futile hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament moves, Washington is reluctant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon be coming to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide full protection from the sun's rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of bizarre giant hats for their SS19 collection at the runway, which opened their mouths to all stylists at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have put their amazing creations on the runway.
Valentino's special creation was a highly extravagant beaded hat, adorned with a wide dome-like housing, which surrounded the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-embellished napkins, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple - but they weren't made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - just in time for Hallouin.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creature resembled the diving equipment, also filled with air tube and water glasses, while another resembled a fused ice-cream cone.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon be coming to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of "La Bomba", the two-legged wide-brimmed straw hat, which we've all seen, ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the highly impractical hat that took off on social media, brought out another great creation in the hallway - a beach bag made of cashews, almost as big as the swimsuit model that was wearing it.
The bright orange raffle bag, embellished with raffle accents and a white leather handle at the top, was the most special creation of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famed personality designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I’m planning to see giant beach hats and bags on city streets – as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edwards: The Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with yet another string of excellent test scores, further bolstered by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at the highest levels, for the career of their choice and for their country as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored educational curriculum, we are proving how the branch of modern languages continues to be a widespread and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, your words will be heard."
If you speak to him in your own language, your words go to his heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we can conclude that languages are top of the list of results, with the highest rate of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish had also received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as the branches of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties employers encountered in filling vacancies, 17 percent of them were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that require foreign language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as a possessor of such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically position a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of concretely 15 people per 2 shillings.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The mastery of many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages they are taught in.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered to be most important to the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a range of languages to choose from in private schools, with pedagogical staff made up of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the skills they need to succeed, however the future may be.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as "the ability of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is expected to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
I don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need the pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval vote suspended for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the next mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November vote is held.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today and how do we follow it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings in the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over allegations of his sexual misconduct, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate stalled for a week as the FBI carried out investigations into the matter.
But the primary purpose of these many rallies is to help Republicans get a head start on the run-up to the November election.
Trump's campaign staff said the five rallies over the next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the tight campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has lagged behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team showed willingness to fight as they keep hopes alive by heading to singles races on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This swing of the wheel is a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players really and never trust more than in such competitions.
Where can we say that we're feeling this pain now?
"They had a six-point gap that has now gone to four, so we can say that there's been some sort of a spike I believe," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, when they remain in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope the odds are in their favor and have a lot of things to encourage, especially from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day where they got three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of shootings to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The party cheers were added as the round continued, inserting the golf ball with an easy hit to bring the match to a draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His easy chase that gave them the win of the game in pit 15 was greeted with a similar cheer, which shows that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't catch a shot at the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shots at the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening, and at nine second shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way in which their energy seems to flow to the enthusiastic crowd and vice versa reinforces the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday and that there will be no other player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory.
Probably both at the same time in different holes.
However, there are still premature declarations of a European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-game hero, when he fell in love with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two doubles in front put the Spaniard and the Swedish in a pit from which they had no chance to get out anymore.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your hole.
The four-player and couples-only games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change there for the better.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the final, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team will still fight even though some people, especially Stateside, have questioned this.
Europe leads 10-6 as they head towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a key advantage on the Ryder Cup final day after coming out of the four-game and doubles series with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods to increase their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless U.S. team in doubles matches in the morning, leading to the 3-1 series of results.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two games, but they couldn't narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined well enough to beat an impotent Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 result.
Woods, who struggled to hold two meetings on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourth game and with pairs and 7 games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourth game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the couples game and took a 2-1 loss to Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have it all in favor on a rather beautiful and fresh day in southwest Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference that needed to be caught by the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four games and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the couple's games after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned the result after a difference of four points in individual games, although Furyk's retaining team needs only one draw to keep the trophy.
However, as he was the second-best player for two days, a setback on Sunday seems to go beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not disarm 'in any way' unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions, which continued on Saturday, were deepening mistrust of the United States and the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures showing good will" in the past year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear tests were taking place, and pledging not to arm itself.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the U.S.," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., our national security will have no self-confidence and under these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a split "phased" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be appreciated because of the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not rule out a breach.
The young man referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a sitting U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward "nuclear disarmament of the North Korean peninsula" with the rival Trump.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must initially give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that nuclear disarmament is initially carried out and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsorily, even by opposing the declaration of an end to the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader made earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have come without this situation."
Despite this, the tone used in the New Address was profoundly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President the Devil" Trump himself called Kim "a raccoon."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should continue to be in place until North Korea does.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeline for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and unabated until we carry out the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, and only within hours North Korea denounced him as having carried out "mafia-style demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security assurances Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are given lessons on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has involved all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of study 'masks' through the use of caffeine by these 'sleepers'.
One academic noted that students at the world's number one university often don't know when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a review on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?'
She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director general of medical services, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep throughout the week.
The course that lasts an hour includes a variety of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, athletes and books in order to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic ranking is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the bedtime routine.
In another part, participants were explained how sleep deprivation in a long-term period increases the risks of heart attack, ischemia, depression and cancer.
A camp map, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviours will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - as you have a right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to spend “a sleepless night” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of a good quality, should be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain into a mode of hunger, making them feel thirsty.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competing institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should set a ringing clock that when they should go to bed, and also that when they should wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of 'blue light' coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can bring out the biological rhythm of sleep in the out-of-work setting.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's boys
The Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's disassembled side a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking to record its first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the fledgling Ladbrokes Premiership chairman, Hess.
Menga scored seven minutes before the first half ended and with a Rangers team placement that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind Hibernian for goal difference.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble after their winger Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, pitched the same 11-yarder who snatched a Hearts point last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team drowns opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in his possession.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Menga gave Scott Pittman in the goal square protected by Allan McGregor, was not used exactly by him throwing the ball out.
A long cross from Keaghan Jacobs' penalty kick found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, only shot him out in the back post of the gate.
The Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they were more hopeful than they really believed in their game in the opposing zone.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a quarter-hour game as he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers managed to make two shots at the gate in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's unforced strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been at odds with what was being seen on the pitch, no one can deny that they deserved it only for the fight they showed.
The Rangers again failed in the long-haul service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept the calm to pass the Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change almost gave an immediate effect as the side followed for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play the way they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett followed each other with long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood strong and denied Jacobs before Lithgow threw out of a ball taken from the corner hit.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty during the game, while he was confused with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the lead.

And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, as it is today 136 years ago and in exile... the day when the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger meter.
A major pillar of science since then, the Geiger meter has become a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film Days of Coronado, with a cast of seemingly unprofessional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge that's used to track radioactive minerals, like uranium.
"When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms being released from radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can ‘stop’ a protein commonly found in many types of cancer and then be re-injected.
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have some types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab so that they ‘break down’ a protein commonly found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West showed up at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a MAGA hat, following his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go properly
Kanye West rallied with studio protests during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called “Ghost Town,” where he was holding a hat that read “Make America Great,” he continued to speak out strongly against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony came into play before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's recordings of the harsh speech were uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post or not.
West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the background because of what he had put on his head.
"They beat me in the back.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.’
They've mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm sunk," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken one?", stating that "I put my superman hat on my head because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
"Try the love."
His comments received whispers at least twice from viewers and members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reports, where one person told the paper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called up as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many people with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous souls: THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE IN THE BALL OF TORTURE."
But broadcaster Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just himself, and that's extraordinary."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or supporting his 'art'), who I believe shames you and who spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
while he is free.
So are we," she added.
Prior to the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the dog that was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington suffers from toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen, makes young boys perceive that they must behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and was asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the age of the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite important" to solving the issue.
"Personally, I feel this issue is quite important at the moment - where did we go wrong with the masculinity show?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing right now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the overly masculine characters appearing there.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel like men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
"Something's wrong with the kids."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer be shooting for Game of Thrones after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that “field battles and horses have come to the top of his nose.”
From November, Kit will take part in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Roze is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found the woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning science fiction series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a difference from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving the HIV virus through this method had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to still prevail.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inappropriate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies GOP senators' data was leaked by staff members, says these are 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' websites on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed these claims were being pushed by experts and the "right-wing extremist" online site.
"Lies, lies and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after all three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to Waters' office and leaked the data of a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims - has in no way been responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement was immediately met with online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial becomes frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't get nervous.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being overly nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take Waters' place in midterm elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"A big break, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had signaled "relevant authorities and law-enforcement institutions about these false allegations."
"We will make sure that the authors are revealed and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on everyone of my staff."
"Johnny English Hits Again" - a comedy with the unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson
It has become the case that in any new British-influenced film, it is seen for hidden messages on the subject of Brexit and this finds application in the revival of the comedy-action enterprise "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with "Johnny English".
Will this satirical comedy show how clearly incapable we are of connecting with the new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the country-eyed character, with his face like a rubber and apparently Johnny English's pimp, has been given permission to confuse things for the second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a vast comical creature designed for territories where English is not spoken, but who speak Chinese.
Of course, he's a secret missing agent, who despite surprisingly claiming to appear as charming, has little from Inspector Clouseau, little from Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of that type who contributed only with the release of a sound in the song 'Chariots of Fire', at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics.
It’s also based on mystery man, traveler and international Atkinson, who once played in TV commercials that have now forgotten Barclaycard, leaving the place in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two good moments in this movie.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval parchment and the propeller blade crashed a little into his helmet.
Here's the gift of physical comedy performed by Atkinson, but the humor seems vague and sometimes excessive, especially when 'serious' films like 007 and Mission Impossible have introduced even a little comedy as an ingredient in their films.
The humor seems to appeal to children more than adults, and Johnny English's mischievous events aren't as creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as Atkinson's in the character of Bean.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the top-secret network of British agents, uncovering the identity of British field agents and has tarnished the agent in the line of duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who emerges as a pompous and battle-ready figure, who is already suffering from an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that resembles Theresa May, but there isn't much text on the script that she can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who unofficially taught how to become a secret agent: here are some beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of a rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former aide, the disgraced Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-ranking girl, where Vicki Pepperdine is used a little wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin do things totally backwards in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, fighting off the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is captivated by the alluring tech billionaire who claims he can solve the plight of British computers: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their hilarious and showy odyssey: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta without permission; and English is totally confused as he tries to use the familiar virtual reality devices for the virtual world.
All sequences are normally done for the final scene, but despite being fun and noisy, the whole thing looks a bit like a children's movie.
It's pretty moderate stuff.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: isn't there a role for Rowan Atkinson that would fit his talent?
The Labour Party has a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to save by using the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see that employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but continuing to bring home the same paycheck.
Sources said the idea would "match" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day week is an idea embraced by the Trade Union Congress, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but a four-day week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of workers and also with the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged for a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not being taken into account by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to convey his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from “anonymous directors” and “beneficiaries” to public service firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government can carry out ‘discharges’ by justifying actions considered as violations.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up Comprehensive Property Funds to pass on to employees 10 percent of private sector firms' capital, meaning a dividend paid annually at a value of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell in '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could affect any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, 'Did you do this?'
It was clear and clear."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
"I've divided my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make any bomb charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show that features a large and impressive list of stars who perform and also have an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the show, to end the 20th century of extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a variety of duties, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other means of assisting in the completion of the event.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when there were 12 years left to reach its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to convince them to ask for these interventions, or is it just another case of what's known as "click-activism" - people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving it a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped spur world leaders to declare $37 billion in policy commitments, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 endorsements and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group calculates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and UK-based enforcement agencies, committed to "helping children grow up to their full potential," promising to "give Rwanda $35 million to help end the pandemic."
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the Power of Nutrition ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will affect 5 million women and children in need of food interventions.
In response to the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like every high civil right and like the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the actors who will perform at this year's New York show, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy for "blockades" to prevent Russian energy exports - U.S. Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary" Washington can rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from spilling into markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them, so that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a nonprofit organization that has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that these approaches are virtually the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of combustibles," he said, referring to Russia as a "fraudulent mess" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after the Trump administration embarked on a mission to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is claimed to double the existing pipeline capacity to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" whether to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after midterm elections.
During a rally in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes putting a woman on top," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "that of course before the vote we need an investigation by the FBI."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large portion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed former Gov. Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for candidates, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing the candidacy.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's returned, can connect him to other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told attendees at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "come a little bit changed, stiffened, coming to think about whether they get the proper respect of the soldiers and aviators and other members of the military for what they have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence following an attack on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and gunfire while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county filed an explanatory document as friends-to-judge on Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S. because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reinstated a 2014 decision by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented migrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," the report said.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on immigrants' entry harmed the U.S. economy, saying their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary arm of the job."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence that are rescuing them.
"Asia is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political persuasion," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum is never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempt in Palu as death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
In the case of the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"The situation feels quite tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she held her sick little son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palusa.
"Ambulances bring in the bodies every minute.
There is no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, pulling out their belongings submerged in the water, in an effort to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were taken to the Military Hospital outside Palusa, where patients are being treated in outdoor settings because of the ongoing earth tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled feeling the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save myself.
I think I was crushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard that the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad on a U.S. daily propagating the common benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections held on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen tariffs level off each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said China's retaliatory tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor in Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that "China is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda ads on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, China's government is being helped by the laudable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstands on the street here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," despite not telling him which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections after the Kavanaugh scandal.
As more leading Republican figures stand in solidarity and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from some sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will face a backlash especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on the subject have been extremely high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't be broken," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill about an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to investigate by the FBI and that it would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite evidence from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will peak," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the periphery and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a backlash if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"This has turned into a convoluted confusion for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will be placed in the defendant's bank, it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and the way they treated that woman," Guy Cecil, the Democratic leader of the US-backed Priorities, told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the vigilance of Ford and Kavanaugh's evidence, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony is unquestionably or very likely, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh’s testimony is unquestionably or very likely.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh, most likely or most certainly, has lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford as well as other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh assaulted him at the age of 17 while he was in a drunken state.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, ‘Inrupt,’ is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open-source platform, called ‘Solid.’
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal after Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "storage of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the hands of the user what type of information they will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to anyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all of their business models are completely overturned overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's inequality debate.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the giving of the Victorian Cross during the First World War to the clergy
The only clergyman to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a warrior is commemorated in his birthplace, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the memorial would be displayed exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the hail of bullets from the fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons on the battlefield and alone killed three people from opposing troops.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set off from a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he "felt quite honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is being shown by the support that is being given to him by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derkukcen Pepa."
Imagine, you've stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and then you're taken away from the opportunity to watch this main event.
The San Jose show contained 13 duels, including six duels in the base package and would air in real time overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to feature the Pepa Piglet.
Some were left unsatisfied as they had stayed up all night until the early hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the move from the game to a children's cartoon as "a nasty joke."
"It's the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate and we had to switch to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Derrkukcja Pepa," yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, so Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed there were a lot of messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
"We're going to do the show with five games instead of six - as we usually do - we've tried to give more to the fans and maybe we've overstepped the mark.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand it until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's "Desert Island Discs," presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The permanent host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because she is ill.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that while growing up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, were the real elements that gave me the push and the strength to cope."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out open because he felt lucky to be able to live open and without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same upsurge.
The couple became parents in June, to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had tickets ready for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘that you won’t be able to be a front row dad,’” he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and changed his life and accepted for the first time that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the local public at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - which accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause him a nightmare.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of form, was left on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his form to not turn this historic moment into a disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time that he participates in this event, a record of his own, which is held every two years, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the double games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the five-time major title winner spent the day supporting the team and working with the hope that he would leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest stroke even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated field of Le Golf National, where long and difficult fields leave no room for wrong shots.
And if it weren’t for the fear of the pitch, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in the ninth game, who has formed a team with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth game this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of 12 singles matches, will start it vigorously, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although he couldn't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back, threw his hand at my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and this week.
"I didn't think he would play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out and so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in Ryder Cup matches.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, where he hasn't been at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun facing it, during this week, and it was nice to see them.
It's more than just a game."
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that the significant lead they have ahead of the last day of singles games in the Ryder Cup, can turn into an unpleasant factor.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where team captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and closed the tournament by winning by a very close margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"He reminds himself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after seeing the 5-3 win at 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at 'Le Golf National'.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we're going to the last walk.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing is over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all along, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this stage.
Tomorrow, we’re going to face another monster.
Tomorrow we're going to have to do something different, and that's another thing to do.
It's great when you're on the pitch with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're tested at your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you need to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget about your partner because he has to go and give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of big return results on the final day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing in what is considered the "Miracle in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during Captain Ben Crenshaw's last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When he takes a leak on one side, he puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We set the formation based on that and we're going to put the guys in the ranking that we believe is the best, once you understand, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with tipping the score and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead-up game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players positioned in the first half of the standings.
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers the entire journey in the match," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
The production of the new German warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's new frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but it won't be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and fairly high costs, local media reported.
The shipment of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-shipment problems damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is known to contain a powerful bullet, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and stealth technology, such as reduction of detection by radar, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the latest technology's warships - which are said to enable Germany to mirror power abroad - will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The "poor" F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially rejected the order for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
They were given little information about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany cited a series of "major defects in software and hardware" that rendered the ship useless during a war mission.
Programming problems were particularly important on the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - as much as half the workforce of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was extremely overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the price of the whole project - including crew training - is also returning to the problem.
It is said to have reached a figure that leaves it speechless of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - out of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion that was originally forecast.
The problems that have gripped the new frigates are becoming especially important following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "finishing the ships suitable to move to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time because the old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust observes the secret life of the nudes of the night
A new research being conducted by a company in Scotland's mountainous areas aims to uncover how night owls use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help protect activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common night owls and those called soprano pipestrelles as well as brown-eared and Daubenton owls in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of night nudists throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand-held detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that will be carried out by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of the sounds of night owls and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which habitats are most important to night owls and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of pastures and how to maintain forests for night owls and other related species.
The number of night owls in Scotland and across the UK has dropped significantly over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development works that bring impact to the nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as shown by adhesive sheets or chemical components of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic animals.
The night owls are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated location-finding technique through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes nudity very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, speech inspections, and are sometimes involved in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only night owl reserve in Threeve, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland's ten night owl species.
The reserve's administrator, David Thompson, says the country is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threea we have a great area for night owls," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of stuff about night owls that remains unknown, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to 'develop'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out inspections for nudity the night before carrying out the maintenance works of the property because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female and young nudity thus wiping out the entire population of an area.
Night owls are protected, and killing, harassing, and disturbing them or destroying their speech is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee with the Night's Watch Trust, encourages people to become part of the relief.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our night owls and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is shifting."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the rape allegations against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he then allegedly paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, addressed to his 142 million followers, just hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports "fake news."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What was said today, fake news," the Golden Ball winner said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have called “unacceptable reports of suspicions about privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse, Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said that "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who is left in the mud by "one percent."
The document states that Ronaldo confirms that the couple has had sexual relations but that it was with the consent of both parties.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a solution out of court because she was "appalled by revenge" and that she was worried she would "be publicly embarrassed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer spent at Juventus' Italian giants in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100m deal.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' the loss of the status of car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost jobs lost.
The plant in Burnaston - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit it will close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "as soon as ordered" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom cars.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be border delays which, according to this industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep at its factory in Derbyshire the inventory of more than a day, the company said, and as a result production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "is built specifically to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we definitely need to be able to continue what has been a pretty successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would halt production, but in the long run, warned that increased costs would lower the plant's competitiveness and consequently lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior union official at the factory, said members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience at the time these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out a deliberate and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election meddling, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility that the president may have obstructed justice.
The debate over whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general from office, putting Mueller's independence at risk, is something that has created months-long rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered setting up a wiretap to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was close to resigning.
Contrary to expectations, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a clash with a hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not yet a date set, it could be this week. I think it could be postponed another week given everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
She then made it clear that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president performs more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then that's a lot better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions, or press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president probably showed the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial exit and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit.
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations for the UK's departure from the EU have continued, approaching a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of the health service, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christion Abercrombie underwent an immediate surgical intervention after suffering a head injury on Saturday, in a 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennesseean journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half.
"He came to the sidelines and fell there," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave the Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before placing it in the barrel and sending it for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five innings on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing him to 18 total innings during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher pulle tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher pulle tax for the purchase of a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the Conservative Party's (Tory) new plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay a higher pull tax on the purchase of a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to "target" high-earning people.
The stamp duty will be applied to individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, while the additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of shelter.
This extra fee - which is added to the current stamp tax, including the increase in the tax rate introduced two years ago for second homes and for properties purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts this move will add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of recently built properties in London are bought by people residing outside the UK, which causes price increases and makes it harder for buyers to find shelter for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capitals - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign-born buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the plant tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding high prices by buying land but not putting it into use, and called on Mrs. May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to fix Britain's "shame on property."
Mr Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of "no reason" departures.
Also, he wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the Prime Minister to the return of the British dream - that is, to a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problem of the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals, who do not live in the UK and foreign societies have it easier to buy homes than British working-class residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too difficult to achieve and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to coach Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, which currently ranks third in League One (the third category), three points away from the head.
He came to the Light Stadium this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I was introduced to Representative B once and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up watching Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the clubs."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager says he's not worried he's following in the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my success will depend on whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
"Given the structure and environment of this club, it certainly has its place in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could bring the club back to the Premier League.
Ross has only three years left to start his coaching career after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb a category higher up to the third round of the cup, as well as transforming St Mirren from a near-fallen club to next season's Championship title winners.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, about taking Alloa's lead.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, made a good life thanks to this profession, and enjoyed some good achievements.
Being a player can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
Again, I'm experiencing a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems like the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so myself all my life as an adult."

According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted the income of struggling restaurants in the UK, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in groups of premises and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant purchases fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA, who compiled the data, said: "The continued sunshine weather as well as England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup led to July following the same trend as June, where venue sales also increased by 2.8 percent, down from 2.8 percent.
Filming in restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
Bars and bars with the main activity of providing drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with major food delivery activity also saw decreases as a result of sunny weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks at bars and bars rose by 6.6 percent that month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-domestic market, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It's no wonder that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering the ongoing cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and the time will tell if the average August temperatures will give the much-desired calm."
Total sales growth in local and restaurant outlets, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Index of industry sales tracking, for the UK's bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom are no older than 11 - have hidden social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles.
This article has raised the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "principal" account that tells their parents
One in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - are opening accounts on social media, which are being used in secret by adults.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed a rapid rise in "false Insta" profiles - linked to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "principal" account that they tell their parents, but they also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that one teenager encouraged others to "rape her."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Athletics in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics, as the non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sport leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as the voice of athletes and I very much hope that I will contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It took a lot of hard work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing a skill exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A company for the production of breast pumps has shared public opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the world's first noise-free and wearable breast pump," consumer technology products company Elvie showcased a hilarious music video, to promote the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a grass-filled cow stall under the sounds of a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I suck myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't six, it's my chest."
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, nurse the ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underestimates the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Just like us, they should be "pregnant" and "born" to produce milk, only that their "babies" are taken from them a few days after they are born.
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside the sockets and doesn't fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can carry their babies?"
Someone else added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "too funny."
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still feeding the baby breast.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I see what it means.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a hilarious ad that targets mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like 'sheep.'"
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have all danced with the "hidden" pump placed in the receptacles.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is noiseless, has no wires or tubes, is placed inside the sockets and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while using it.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD (Executive Creative Director) at Mother commented: "Elvis Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the use of breast pumps and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come out on the front page.
During London's fashion week, a mother of two showed up at the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of the rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be sent to their backers.
Usually, most supporters have been undocumented migrants themselves, and have been afraid to risk their position in the country by trying to apply to have a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give their toes, and this data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters stay in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we're continuing to track these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children's data, the officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the time of the detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through video-conferencing and not physically, to argue their claim for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports obtained by the system in recent months, the longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or fall into depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more severe in larger settings such as Tornillo, where, due to their size, they are more likely to sidestep signs that a child is having difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, declared that foreign forces remain on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that they will "act with them in the right way."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "foreign illegal forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue, which should be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey deal avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had "clear guidelines" and expressed confidence that the military strikes would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution," and warned there would be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope, the accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic fund of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of weariness of the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million during the peak hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the top of the cable channel rankings with 3.5 million viewers during major event evenings.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor," told ABC News.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
It commemorates a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Neglect is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "quoted information" in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's ostrich-skinned bomber jacket, worth $15,000 ("a dress then filled with arrogance," The Washington Post reported.)
I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does and what makes it look like a 'reality show,' is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the cast and the unexpected day-to-day developments of Trump's show.
You can't leave an episode without seeing it otherwise you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people saying, 'This is the last beginning of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector pours into tight competition for Congressional elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash rush as a result of reorganizing the electoral zones that forces two incumbents to run for the same post.
This recent reshuffle in suburban Pittsburgh has put Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the seat in another area, in a special election, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12 area, which has been overcrowded with the new 17.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which, in January, ruled that the old areas were unconstitutionally and unfairly designated in favor of the Republicans.
This contest, in the new 17th area, has also prompted a strong backlash in campaign funding from the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election, widely followed, for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts see the Democrats as easy favourites.
The U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama as partners drove out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "latest decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only examined against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for controlling narcotic substances, developing and supporting the economy.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and certain restrictions on visas, would be severe for the Central American country and its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central American countries pushed for a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow a similar gathering last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to states.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conferences to take place, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to deliver a speech at the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats said.
All three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided their anonymity was maintained.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right of anonymity.
Study the history.
The next event that is expected to happen may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly moving his investigation to verify whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will have to give an account to this body, at a time when he is preparing to stand before voters again, and perhaps eventually face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall - or that of his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were about to strike a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable course of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested secretly interrogating the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI is seeking for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the High Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?"
And most of all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassadors' residence where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika symbol.
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers are expecting Rapid Vienna knowing that a win against the Austrians, following Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a favorable position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, in general, I believe that the draw was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half while we showed up in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their last match but, with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries and changes at the club but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it very much; the training is going well.
"I hope we can move forward, throw the past season behind us and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to pay attention to them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent responded that they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life-saving insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care attorney and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting an attorney for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and will guarantee the payment of bills if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you are taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you're ready.
"Not only the financial aspect is at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications will be used?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for this plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said as the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication networks out of service, aid workers have failed to get information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which was closest to the 7.5-sided quake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half live in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed the lives of about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A blizzard struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after remembering the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, for obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and for opposing the arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he got the phone.
Paul is being held at the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held a security in the form of $500 unsecured bonds, KTUU reported.
According to reports from the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about his admission of guilt, he declared that he was "absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three category A violations, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a category B violation, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This matter is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and drunken gunfire during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected NYC Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out the terrorist attack on a bike path along the western highway in lower Manhattan, stepping on pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "premeditatedly" killed eight victims and caused serious bodily injuries "premeditatedly," according to the letter intended to seek the death penalty, filed in New York's southern district.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be awarded the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury faced Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in aid of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's method of executing the crime as "disgusting, cruel and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the letter reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring and spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
They were both executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no regrets during the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not admittance of guilt associated with life imprisonment without possibility of appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at the Conservatives' conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would be out" if the Brexit secretary were Mr Farage.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces to unite her group has been highlighted by pro-residence conservatives in the EU, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is having difficulty implementing the compromise plan reached at Chequers, amid attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insist that she will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the harsh reactions - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos."
During the Departure march meaning Departure, Mr. Bone stated that he wanted to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not supported even within our party and by the activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are considering abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, it's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you do something like that."
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is independent, proud and government itself."
Meanwhile, the pro-stayers marched on Birmingham, before holding a rally that lasted two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists held placards of the Conservatives against Brexit after the group's appearance over the weekend.
Labour backer Lord Adonis joked with the Conservatives about the safety issues they had with a "social app" at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and technology needed for Canada plus plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "carefully consider" the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future during a town hall meeting, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-directed Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the helm.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes putting a woman in charge."
A man has been arrested for the murder of LSU player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced, via a media conference.
Police had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was gunned down and killed near the University of Southern California campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, carrying a gun, and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the police department in the eastern Baton Rouge area.
Sims, 6'6'' long, played 32 games, of which 10 as a starter, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title as team's guidance gives victory to Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions "would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton race in "traffic" at the end of the carpool, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes made the stop a lap later and was positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out on top after several maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave space from the inside after a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first lap ranked seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top in a big part of the race after not changing tyres to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop on lap 44 but failed to improve the pace on the remaining eight laps by dropping fourth place to Raikkonen.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed himself to be a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these position exchanges," Hamilton said.
Very weak use of body language.
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein during a Saturday rally over her insistence that she wasn't the person who "outed" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer you to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "lawful, evil and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing about what's happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at inati, when you look at people who are angry, legal, bad and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the posts I made in secret and then people say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it myself."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who put out the letter?
Do you remember her answer... did you pull out the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't put her story on the square," Feinstein told the commission.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked me to."
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker gestures before."
Defending the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break in order to take power and control," Mediaite reported as saying by the president.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss suffered on Friday against the Belfast Giants in the valuable Elite League challenge, winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly moved to double advantage thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score for the home team before Dwyer returned the Giants to advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals to secure the win.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to Adam Keefe's fiancees, who on Friday evening, returned from a disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, by an assistant to Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford gave the assistant to Beauvillier, who doubled the score, four minutes later.
During an intense first half, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted for the Cownie draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the break by scoring his second goal of the night, at the end of the first half.
The locals were regrouped and Bouchard returned to the equation with a hard hit at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined between them by assisting Nielsen, who gave Dundee the lead for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half and secured the win for his team with the fifth goal scored in the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic controller lost his life by making sure that hundreds of people on an airplane escaped the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after he lost his life by making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more have been declared missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to worry the area and many people have been trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save him, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the tower of control that was shaking violently at Palus airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stood to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could depart safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news broke my heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the local disaster relief agency says entry into the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble, while others could not be found," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
The waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive mortuary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in troops.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation duties.
"Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person has been lost after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that ran a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane being submerged in water.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they were not finding a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at the island's Chuuk airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the consequences of the incident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
"This is an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the waist level, he and other people managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming as he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to repair a nearby rock helped rescue them, using an airship to transport people to shore before the plane sank at about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have lost their lives in the collision of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of them.
An analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office presented its arguments in the retrial of a person accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone records to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, a fact that refutes his earlier claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's at the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that night he was in Sanford's truck, the latter said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is Tellis' statement, which said she had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they only had a week to get to know each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to give closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the jury will take the decision that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and messages dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop conscious again.
In the UK, a resurgence of artists like The Fugees and Common has been noticed unlike artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another man of color?!
The New York City Dado sued the couple for leaving work after receiving the "racist" message.
A New York Dado has sued a couple for discrimination on leaving work after receiving a message mistakenly sent by a mother who complains she was "another black man."
The couple has denied they are racists, considering the lawsuit as a "bribery."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her concern when she discovered that Giselle Maurice's new nanny was a woman of color when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt in embarrassment," fired Ms. Maurice, on the grounds that their current African-American nanny had done a poor job and that instead she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day's work and was then sent home with a "kick in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation worth $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do things like that," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the claims that they were racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, as they feared they could no longer trust them after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown inadvertently, even if by mistake?
Your new-born child?
Tell me.'
Regarding the lawsuit as "abuse," Plasco said he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?"
It's not a good thing to do," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new paper shows that Paddington's publishers were afraid readers wouldn't link to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"We are delighted to have seen Paddington's tremendous success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy spider to write the children's book, would be upset if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, last year after his death, contained "sadness and happiness."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and didn't brag," she said.
"Paddington was so true to it that it was like having a child that succeeds: you feel proud of it even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the character of Paddington his own merits."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but with no results.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was too heavy, that he didn't think it would work out," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"I got a call from Nad telling me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tasha, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart at work were losing their effect and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a long time ago and now everything was "locking".
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
Over time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great deal of regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who wear black are posting letters to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspirational messages on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Davis' son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"People always say that his smile brightens every room."
However, he quit his job before changing his life, as he was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so that people know that there are people who can help them and who they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt upset, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and did no action."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've destroyed us.
We all need to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the timing of the FBI's investigation.
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for - a limited investigation in time and at the facility - maybe we could bring a little harmony," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "dissolving" among the opponents' many hurdles.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
All of them come as a result of time.
Congressional elections are only 5 weeks away, on November 6 - if Republicans go wrong, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the situation and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen under Kim's leadership.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Union Ministry, said there were about 1,127 deserts last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penelope has not made any public comments.
Most of the defectors from North Korea take citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them leave for China, which has the longest border with North Korea and can be crossed there more easily compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers deserters illegal immigrants and not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
The meeting came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, on general terms, to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress so far.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, disarm first," Mr. Ri said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he's not worthy of serving in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that due to his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman were ever brought up like that, people would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his keynote address, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at times almost shouted or "screamed" when talking about his family and the years of high school.
He accused Democrats in a statement before the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of his figure", organized by liberals outraged by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi declined to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a no-confidence motion in the event of his appointment, and if Democrats win the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's ineligible not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, one-sided person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say, 'Oh, how good!'" Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years in the making, and it doesn't get to the end without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who worked in a leadership position, who stated that she also cried when she was upset, but had come up with a style that whenever she was upset and started to cry, she would say to the interlocutors, "You can think I'm upset and that's why I'm crying.
But I'm actually upset."
And then she continued to talk.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from an old job, in an office where men dominated and at one point I found myself crying out of unbearable intimacies, was the moment when an older woman grabbed me by the throat - a cold manager whom I had always been a little scared of.
“Don’t ever let others see you cry,” she said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're bored, and they'd be happy to get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital affair aboard a boat named "Monkey Business" and was pulled out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, extremely upset, realized that there was no reason not to think of running for president himself.
“This wasn’t a well-weighted decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had lagged behind the fundraiser, so it vowed not to compete if it failed to raise $2 million.
But it was a futile war.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Don't you think I'm going to get a haircut?" she asked herself.
During the speech where she announced that she would not be running an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion – gratitude for the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and sign voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that she suffocated.
"I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking about what people would write on my gravestone.
"What's that?"
The advantages of the US-China trade war for Beijing
The first trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and as the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week, when new tariffs hit $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been retaliated each time "in kind," ultimately imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on more than $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return it to the U.S. with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to surrender anytime soon.
Removing the measures from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too shameful to bow publicly to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken quickly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic declines in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the New American Security Research Center, which focuses on A.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where you had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
About six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country will not accept assistance or conditional aid from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 with 10.5, at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six games in a row on European soil and has won the trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn managed to get 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced the most difficulties during the tournament, led the first blow in the water and closed the 16th pit with 3 shots more than the specified level, losing the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who have achieved the 5-0-0 score since the current format began to be applied, in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
"Success is the team's, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said after the European team's victory.
He passed the word to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated 2&1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his games in France and now has 13-21-3 statistics, during his Ryder Cup career.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team faced difficulties throughout the weekend to get the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing appearance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were a few moments during this parade when we put pressure on the European team.
Let's go fast.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
"We will regroup, we will work with the PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
"I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to take off his hat.
They played better than us."
