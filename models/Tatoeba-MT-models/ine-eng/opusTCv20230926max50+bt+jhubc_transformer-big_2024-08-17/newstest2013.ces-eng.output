Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, calls such fraud a myth that election fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last 10 years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments since 2009 have been enacting new laws that make the process of election or registration on the electoral roll more difficult.
This phenomenon saw a surge following the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the elections, and deprive citizens of the right to vote by registering in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required a photo ID to be submitted to voters.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of India was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported such bills in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, it does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required ID card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions unduly affect mainly young people, members of minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their propensity to be democratic candidates are not allowed to use their ID card with a photograph of their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose rather Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship document in an election.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that mandate voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 backed legislation in eight states that would remove voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns to register voters helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the term for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Spaniards.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have very strongly opposed the passage of laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have vetoed a number of bills.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
In part, they managed to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have passed laws requiring photo identification.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak above all of the preconceptions of approved laws and see them as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: to pass an examination or not?
The PSA test yielded erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, which led to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this further increased the hesitancy of men, who already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the USA, a high degree of contamination between individual tested groups has manifested itself, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who did not go to the examination had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American ancestry are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are incurable.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer that does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten them with life.
Rather, we will suggest active surveillance and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer treatment.
More and more often and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment to treat and which not.
Therefore, I recommend that you do an examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows to evaluate pros and cons in the context of the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best means to limit the risk of disease by adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers cause heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplainable.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes cost 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Incentive: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer decreases by half.
Weight (kg)
According to the SCC, fitness and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrient
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid customs duties for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by soaking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although according to one of them there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies speak more about its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Treatment doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a justified stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto confirms it rather, but all the data is still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume it's the Higgs boson, as the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what's actually going on.
There is an unquestionable law in this world that says two things cannot happen at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Furthermore, it divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find well-ordered citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other end, the bosons move, submissive anarchists who do not appreciate anything at all - definitely not this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons, which we leave unnoticed here, and "force particles", by which the great natural forces are spread and with which the Higgs boson is the most famous.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, "carriers of power".
A more stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, only with the difference that it takes another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with the frozen level of the pond, only a very large boulder is already gnawing.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with a 27 km circuit! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field once again lends itself to clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles and not all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And yet, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let’s look at it) don’t.
And Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> asks, what are all these researches that "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, many physicists literally wish to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the cosmic matter (again, ouch!).
However, CERN has so far not found such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Look, at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution that their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the laboratory".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although initially unplanned by Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through its Commission for the Dignity of Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in a sensitive end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue soon, and at the same time a draft law is being prepared.
A lot of work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks back at the delicious breakfast and agrees that we will help him to eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, brings him medicine, offers him a bath.
Dare to die in the ordinary.
"My greatest desire is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In life, you learn that men urinate in vests," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"Depends on which person's abilities," says the psychologist.
According to the opinion of a number of persons engaged in palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation with full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she asks us to put her breathing apparatus on.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the next few days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little if we realize that we will all die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given, for example, brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, they were carrying a beer to Mr. X., who died later that night.
This morning, his son drinks a beer in honor of his late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, days go by one after another, but they do not resemble each other.
In addition to a thirty-nine-year-old man who rejoices at the last meeting with his family, thoroughly grounded on pillows, while they drink in his honor, a thirty-six-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, a woman and two small children, after having the opportunity to try everything.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer under 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, and 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to oncology patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that leads many physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by palliative care leaders such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on standby in enormous pain, without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is afraid that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive proper care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already very low when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending my treatment, she said she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when their palliative care team alleviated their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative, which the patient falls asleep until the moment of death, whether by accident or if the sedative is given permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, who will not be relieved of pain, will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
The implementation of this report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters.
This "branch" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took the essential measures," Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former Montreal police chief, said ironically.
It sparked a scandal in 2011 based on a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec’s road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only approved after a long delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption by civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved on contracts a billion dollars," when some people have kept their instincts to get a share of them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he added, hoping to "disclose the leniency of some people."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit founded in 2011 is also engaged in combat with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the "Marteau's comrades" police officers, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "money transfer cartel" significantly eased the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of inspections and have accused a number of municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban municipality, of fraud and corruption.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal accusations have also been received by Montreal-based traffic engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he dedicated 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a mafia-affiliated middleman, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was a candidate.
After 2000, Zambia was generous to all parties, dedicating more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money lenders, whose prices exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocketbooks worth a total of $ 736,000 in exchange for commissions, which he overcharged with money.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had been paid rewards for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-tasking.
Mayor Martin Dumont's party organizer then accused Tremblay of blindfolding the parallel budget, which brought dirty money to his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for...1.6 million to promoters right in the midst of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says that "she pulls the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system promoted by ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the process is "painful, but positive."
We are in the wound-cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure oversight so that these questionable practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "ambassadors informed of this lie" if they did not get involved in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I’ve heard it’s just a weak decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation, he said: “Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics.”
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can no longer go down; if we focus courageously on the substance of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in matches.
In football, everything goes very fast.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine to the transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on by individual stages.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The forces of this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater appetite for matches and wants to give maximum performance.
And Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele at his fingertips, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He has also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first season of PSG?
In the 1st league, Lyon took the leading position.
But we are still in a bind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the semi-finals very easily.
What is your goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first in front of Porte so we can play in the home semi-finals.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget is already...
In order for Paris to become a major European club, it has to win titles and make history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this intention a reality.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think we'll make it this year.
Even though big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are striving for the title, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there is still something to blame in the newspaper, it is not pleasant.
The question is, what more can people want from you?
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set the style of the game.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who didn’t make it to the semi-finals for the second season, but they also invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you can expect to get ahead of the other 15 points!
This will offend the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which did not succeed last season, moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
It shows how great the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
PSG seems to be relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance in everything.
It is good to say that there is a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a League 1 star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it and I came out stronger.
Today I am also able to play good matches in the national team.
This is what I have been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you view Didier Deschamps’ first few months at the helm of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the MS.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
And so was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting game?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political perspective here: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-like conversion protocol that allows file exchange between two partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it is at the limit of about $10 (the list of rates is listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin refers to “the most successful virtual money”, “competing the dollar and the euro” and “the like of ordinary money”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used to process a video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority monitors and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are depositors of books of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
In fact, every transaction between two users takes place between two e-mail addresses by means of an e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information file associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of common accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task given to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase of cutting the file; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they "split" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (within ten minutes) for the purpose of fraud, the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred million, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and there has been a theft of stored bitcoins.
“The shell used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the possibilities of laundering dirty money thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of common accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the educational book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to communicate an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and to move to more horizontal systems.
“Bitcoin will take a while to get established, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapsis and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. forces are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who we have punished are the ones who have suffered the most damage, because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 dead soldiers, and what about all the injuries and bruises.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as they did in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Now they are experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces pull back, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of the mountains dotted with almonds thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by air escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable progress in 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid a price for the darkness of these villagers, who were completely controlled by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main officers of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They were discredited; most of them were never in combat.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people long for a government that will not be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity will leave: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideologies.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they came to know the modern world and its advantages intrigued them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million people living in Kabul, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to go back to the obscurity of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already there.
Will the authorities that come before her be considered legitimate?
Former commanders in the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias, which will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization modeled on Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is not working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And that only added to the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, however, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French departments at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "getting your heart and soul" has been working, trying to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, in which the service of "civilian-military steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but reached a state of emergency thanks to the numerous French non-governmental organizations.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of arable land.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free these farmers from the insurgency led by foreign groups, they want, according to their words, to achieve a small amount of civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and directly affected by them.
Difficult Work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has moved on to the next game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the wacko.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else’s opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave the assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative further strengthened the country’s fragmentation.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "violate his word" and "swindle the law".
Its supporters, however, say it is a means to reverse the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
There will be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the Egyptian text to clarify the article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the entire country is ousted by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: “Either you approve my text, or I will keep unlimited powers” that would otherwise have to end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the announcement of the constitution, they slammed the door with the fact that they did not have the opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 substitutes were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further dwelled on the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around...the hours of prayer, when some committee members held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the principal source of law".
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Criminalism," argues the liberals, who see in it only a speaking problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on matters relating to the verification of the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “persons called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of the theocracy.”
Liberal concerns are further fuelled by the fact that the university’s next rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, no specific religious consequences have been revealed.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulams, but university workers, many of them graduated from French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
He agreed, however, that "there may be objections to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used therein belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic juridical science].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves.”
Yesterday's approved text is, in addition to religious sites, highly criticized for the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them compared to the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
In addition, civilian trials will not be prohibited in military courts, as demanded by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations talk about their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal act of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the untouched nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all who enter this "bath" will receive God's mercy.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will walk through the Way of Pain or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Tomb of God on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the spot where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the Wall of Tears, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Taking the Road Vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained hidden from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can reach it by their own forces.
The others are taken by a cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the well-known Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
This ski paradise is served by a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting a unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won’t be able to visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His paintings are widely represented by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha museum-bathroom, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bath users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique Ralli Private Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops in the area.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum – the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter, and you will find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of the children of the Jews, and the names of the countries in which they died, are these.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving your health
Israel’s three main spas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
All of them offer swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can also swim in the winter months, because the temperature of the water in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most special sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
The Azur water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who are not able to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and medicinal mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the bronchi, diabetes, to cure the strangled nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Ancient Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were crossed by a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists actually love the alleys with narrow alleys, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, the carefully reconstructed theatre is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a transfer.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, he stops working in markets, in shops and in public transport.
And Sunday morning starts the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you only get kosher food: except pork, seafood, shell-free fish and dishes that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls of minced oats - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Therefore, there are a lot of well-fed cats who gracefully "travel according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Transient cats love populated places and with taste they indulge in every kind of goodness.
According to the brand, the car will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And to borrow a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To know the country and rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
'Great and powerful' to announce it in Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, fraudsters have already appeared in the country who sell “false” certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into effect, according to which every migrant worker will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, the housing and communal economy, lifestyle and retail.
However, the FMS promises that over time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is also not subject to people who have successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, Conviction and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were often able to ask the question in the press: what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, above all - the representatives of the migration service correspond - it will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman of the Board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in immigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people, who under the pretext of helping him provide a "command" to terrible, cramped accommodation, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend days to 12 hours without food.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive, they will cheat them, they will seize their passports, they will not pay the promised wages," says MS Tolib <0xC5><0xA0>aripov, head of the main Tajik administration of labour migration.
Don't give up!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia, recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get into, but do not even have experience with the given work.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they have to go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don’t have it, they won’t take exams or get any other official jobs.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are living in Russia illegally as before.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Banned"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - Umed Chuskadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only the documents of migrants about registration are fake.
FMS employees have already obtained several false certificates of passing the language test.
The falsified documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope that they would thus facilitate the problem of passing the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more than the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
For now, the government can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the time it takes for them to take a basic Russian language course.
For visitors who do not know Russian, it is assumed to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take the illegal arms market into circulation
The share of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is proposing to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is a reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the incitement was the shooting at weddings that took place without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the gun law would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "stitching screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "nonsense tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in an interview with the Russian edition of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1,168,000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the laws in the field of civilian weapons will not take the offender to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel-in-Service Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years in the offices of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accept orders for weapons
The first of them - "military or military path", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen from criminals by representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "primarily" get for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It's proven that some fires were set up intentionally - to cover up the shortfall," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers are also making their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are being set up that are not competitive in the international market, and they are eliminating the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia has been formed that has organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive agencies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "to be the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there were thefts of weapons during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in black "archeology" excavations are not bought long ago - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, the sellers go directly to the military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the flagpole, the interested party buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He takes her to the city and sells her there for 900 euros for a piece with two bins," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever they start to burn the plan in the clarity of the crimes, they will make a check purchase from the dealers with illegal weapons,” the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Testing" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we would act together.
The price was mostly up there.
Military reporter Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - a consultant. - I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to arrange that the daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He also gives them to me, because he knows I won't give them to him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to stand for publication on the subject.
The scheme has not changed, according to him.
They gave him a photo album, where it was "everything you thought about".
'I felt like I was in a luxury store, 'said the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, does not offer bunnies in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the forest and we set a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is firing well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Reservoir on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to the website and groups on "Vkontaktu", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising caption on the website "Buy a fighting pistol or a vending machine".
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently toppled a huge network of intrusive websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.
People are starving to death for bait, and then they're mining coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through an ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a press spokesman for the NGO "Right to Arms."
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website you can remain without weapons and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to Arms" you will get a gun Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from the warehouses to long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period of January - October 2011, and amounted to 22,9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices 7.8% of the time with the collapse.
Fast food and supermarket workers on strike in the US
"McDonald" works at the cash register of up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
All this action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries that rank-and-file employees receive at Walmart and in fast food systems, the goal of protest organizers is to achieve in them the creation of their trade union organizations.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when the orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfed millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, have left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational chain companies whose goods are destined for people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart only shop at work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the amount of expenses, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase to the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s lawyers point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should not cause virtually any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday through midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, company spokesman Dan Fogelman said that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their goal was not Walmart stores (those in the listed progressive city are not very popular, and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their New York ranks get $8.90 an hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers who work part-time behind the desk after school and live with their parents will get a job at McDonald’s.
Only a few people see their main source of food or plan to stay there for a long time.
Currently, I am constantly meeting with McDonald’s workers, who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at “McDonalda” on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than double their current minimum monthly wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be set up in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing the establishment of trade union organizations and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to introduce a fast-food trade union in companies for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests also took place in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The climax of the event was at the midday gathering at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, especially city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and pays you your dues!"
Demonstrators also garnered support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together to support fast food workers so that they get the fair rewards for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, although not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At its annual conference earlier this year, Google presented a working model of the new technology, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Sharam Izadi, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
L<0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xA1> is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us what your research group is working on.
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting possibility to control with gestures.
- What else is there for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred interaction to the physical level, a lot of interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow so far is not separate.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Certainly it can not be considered a cure-all - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about vague, only about such shallow, short ones.
The gesture would not be perceived by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It’s still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How, for example, will you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
With the current view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this gives work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Human motion is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are quite frankly a bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, serially manufactured sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects a person’s interaction with the machine.
For me, at work, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it is actually a common visible-band sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play around with the camera placement curve, and see how it helps to determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smartphone in the raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of augmentation of reality, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone at any time on the basis of the cloud platform, projection screen and beyond.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in it is their power (private things you see only you), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
His hands don't feel anything!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of touch sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain kind of substrate for the display.
It records the compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding nuance to these “images in the air” — for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located creates a touch sensation, but it’s still very weak — as if you were blowing at your toes.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to trick your brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a man who is physically located in a very tight space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also moving platforms.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, then the work is still for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers—many things are in the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching the all-Russian reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man, who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion pubs and at the openings.
Cyril Miller’s paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Petrograd narrators, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - is an outstanding man of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 80's and early 90's.
In addition to being an urban person, his appearance on the streets provokes a smile on the face of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
Recently, he took up the bottle and became a Petrograd bottler, because he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk all over the city in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although, in general, it is true that everything that is slightly different from gray, awakens aggressiveness and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at keeping the conversation going.
The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in N<0xC3><0xBD>vsk<0xC3><0xBD>, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazonians, who brought us to the Pushkin 10, and there were no other waves.
It draws me to theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
And it all came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place at Pushkinsk<0xC3><0xA1> 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how the Strings were brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
Strings and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in fitted jerseys, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galician times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regular guests left.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 was organized a survey was in the press, a special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, thus ending my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and insight are captured vividly.
I'm having a show called "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, to be so today is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of a totalitarian rearmament in the ordinance.
Today, people meet according to clothing, they are oriented to external mechanics, not to the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you have to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- We've seen you as a city bottler recently. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, the commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people met in silence, loved one thing, loved another.
Today everything is broken up into micro-communities, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
- He's going to be a fan, and that's where the sexual social sphere comes in.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land and 10 thousand of them will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will shrink.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures of a collector hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing paintings.
I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
Not all of them can relate to culture.
During the time of the proper emperors it was not so in all, the emperors may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that it is necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
In St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Taste is thriving today.
The same Erart, but different in that they honestly say that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburg is?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And at our peak, art is doing poorly.
We need a cultural land, but today we have more writers than readers, that’s wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion business, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of the St.Petersburg grant
Born in the Universe
The country is in danger.
Global Warming or Collision with a Killer Asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set out to search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in conditions of no hardship or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is a big one.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be captured, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a high-ranking scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the issues of reproduction in space, scientists began with the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on a circular track are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then was carried out the removal of insects in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make mounds.
After 10 hours, in freshly hatched birds, the instincts completely disappeared.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" with the animals flew on the runway 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But in the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were broadcasting into space already pregnant.
They didn’t find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the offspring were born with the cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their normal environment, they simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans can, in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tere<0xC5><0xA1>kovs.
The most precious thing that mankind has is a woman’s body.
Our Teak has flown away, and no one on Earth has been able to tell if it will last a flight into space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says a veteran of the Vachtang Vachnadze space and rocket industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina T<0xC4><0x9B>re<0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of a second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savick<0xC3><0xA1> was born, who visited orbit twice and also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, who were born after many years and grow health offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," said cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valeriy Poljakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory flight preparation stage.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts acquire the habits needed to work in an open space.
The water imitates the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for small children it is a natural food.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the mother's fetal water and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, only 2 weeks will pass.
"It's very little to make a child forget something," says newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In short - if the state of weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then for women, the inevitable gravity is more natural, an attractive force.
In a state of heaviness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, and the ability of the body to expel the fetus decreases very quickly.
We can put this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valeriy Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by the earth’s attraction, it cannot properly form a skeleton or a muscular system.
It is not possible for a newborn to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs unconditionally for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a person with a disability who will be completely unadapted to the environment here," predicts the head of the bioethics committee IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will set out in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the black system failed due to politicians
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and high-quality legislation, but it is bouncing in its application.
In an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right application - that's what we lack in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, he cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>a's approach to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law has to be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister can not prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to check and enforce obligations," states Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislations and then also the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation in our country is perhaps more "strict and perfect", but the practice itself is in some respects better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of law itself.
What can this project help you with, and what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such a joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to refine the laws, reduce and improve the limits, if it does not have such a positive impact.
“Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, if necessary, criminal conduct.
But by reducing the order limit, we don’t necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system will get so much "paper" that those who want to search for holes in the system will draw from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our NKU, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the NK<0xC3><0x9C> there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as us, also has a college, only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany has a federal system, it also has these courts at the level of individual federal states - that's how the system differs from ours.
BRH can only control the federal money, represented by state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is considered a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries that we see as a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no use to them to cooperate with our office, wouldn't it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean to your office, does it already have an impact?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in control actions in our country.
Because we do ex-post checks, there is a need to count on some delay.
So far, we have only seen this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "risk detection of unsustainability", through which we have passed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analysed them - there the changes will of course manifest themselves, because the limits, the conditions of some types of selection procedure will change.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit, or a further burden, of the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem here may be that she will "tighten" the rules and will not be able to follow them.
Already for the operation of the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who make a formal mistake that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road goes.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "black system" - and what does that mean?
Is the swartz system banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be set in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister can not prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it go," but he can't say that we'll do like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are quite strict rules on what is to be formally implemented – which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be right - that's what we lack in my opinion.
Roads are cold places, but they are often slippery.
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
But most of the time, the roads are slippery, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were busy this morning, but the places were cold and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
Snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also less visible due to fog, according to data from the dispatch of regional road users.
The R6 motorway and first-class transport are now accessible without restrictions in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All 2nd and 3rd class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On them, however, in some sections there are still remains of frozen and places of trapped snow.
Especially in higher positions, it is necessary to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost, in higher positions and on the mountains there may be a layer of snow caught on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Motorists warn drivers against frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
The find can be in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>t, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
The snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlicky Mountains.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia it is mostly clear and partly clear with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are busy this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It is freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver must also count on the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
This is due to information from the regional road users' office.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by traffic managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frosty surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
The second and third class communications are wet and also in this case, warnings for frozen sections apply.
Drivers should be careful especially on less frequented trips in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
With snow on the road, drivers must now count towards the highest locations in the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spill, she remained on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle and on her way towards the Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
The motorists avoided snowing in the field on the night, according to <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk, about three centimeters of snow fell on the roads.
In other parts of the region, the roads are mostly free of restrictions.
"In <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk lies the remains of snow in the highest positions.
With the snow on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle, drivers have to count towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," the <0xC4><0x8C>TK dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration said today.
Their colleagues also went to Jesenicka in the field at night, the roads to and from the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, there are unlimited roads, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, drivers should be careful in forest areas where the roads have remained wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
Several hard-to-reach places are reported this morning by roadmen in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>steck is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so that ice and snow are likely to endure on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech highlands, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No operational complications have been reported so far.
The occurrence of ice is reported by road users especially from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, it was ideal conditions for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night light and frost.
Adverse conditions are also reported from the main traffic movements on the I/13 road on the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> and Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> regions.
The fence from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by the bent branches of the trees, which bent under the snow to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap we make it more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
This is a national benefit measure that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before the 20th of December at 9 pm 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys towards the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem towards the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Abolished".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, will she also perform at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and that in the end, so if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems are also connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
He wrote the words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also sings Xindl X...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of charity events and concerts...
We are trying to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts towards the end of the world be for?
On the equipment of the barrier-free Studeo educational center, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Tap civic association in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute.
For students of Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute schools, lecturers regularly attend and engage in activities that are fun and interesting to them.
The students themselves do not have the means to become lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We have tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xA1>, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning similar "bombing" events in the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are already in the US, I would like to connect it with the performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, you have already performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric trolley, its trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, furthermore, of course, we carry with us a large amount of cargo and bags with tools...
However, so far it has always managed without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I have been amazed at how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
With trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in disability, public access to the disabled, and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in full swing.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move himself in the center of the city.
There is no such obviousness as, for example, wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but it is only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years back to what made you start it in 1998?
I joined Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so together with my colleague I founded an interesting music ring.
Well, over time, as our presenter L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, things got a little out of hand (laughs).
But has the popularity come only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
It occurred to us that the work that is not visible, in essence, as if it did not exist.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to pull it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It’s logical in a way, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural...
But that regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when something happens to people with disabilities, it’s not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Did this success also help you to be a strict boss, as many people have called you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the exam twice a week, come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on trips to concerts, then the enthusiasm quickly leaves.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Angelovitch Ship.
We are an open group, people leave and come, it cannot be prevented.
He who has will and taste, always has the door open for us.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 pm
The Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem will be held in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by a tele-bridge during the singing of the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free entrance tickets in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a meeting of the European Space Agency’s country ministers, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started working closely with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts devoted their flights to space even before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entry into Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for the Entry into Cosmonautics in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonauts.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautism, and his contribution was also rewarded by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway train was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the missile should have been used to launch the dragnet or to brake it.
Information about this sweater is known only from the period press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage in rocket fire.
The research was provided by the Armament Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the preserved materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket was published in the professional press, which was designed by the engineer Rohozinski, and the following year the work Rocket - air torpedo and aerial missile bomb by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects for the military use of rocket technology, which coordinated all work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work ended with the start of the war.
Other works on cosmonautism appear in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with cosmonauts.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of this year PTA became a full member.
In the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zaraniewicz (1902–1959) became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a significant role in the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket) rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with an access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage flight tests of the RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bled desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was already supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, space was available with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronautical Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and formed the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko to be involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with gratuitous financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labor, (wage) there is a price tension.
By this term it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by "subduing" the price of the competitor in order to extract a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to shift production abroad, or there to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is reinforced by the absolute reluctance of the masters of business to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage he has caused to society in his pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create in individual economies a situation in which the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictation of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done both by the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and by limiting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
In the SRN, there have been many years of public food outlets for the poor, who cannot do their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people who are properly employed to receive such a salary that they have to be remunerated to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Parliament.
The austerity measures taken by virtually all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people are forced, under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse, to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or to live on hunger wages on the margins of society in the hope that a private investment may one day come to the country.
But here it is necessary to ask where it comes from.
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim that the state cannot participate capitalily in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists strongly on the view that the state must not interfere with the economy by controlling interventions.
Then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence, in fact, now governs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that, for lack of funds, the state ministries are submitting draft laws to private law firms that are densely associated with industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type declare, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly coming to terms with the situation, as Appianos describes it in his work Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For bribes, unlawful gain of favor, and by means of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption went unchecked, and the people went to the elections with their own voice, which they had already sold, and the very power of the people did not come to the office at all, so that once as a result of this upheaval they had to stand for eight months without the consuls.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the present society is based on a ruthless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the general social interest.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, capable of understanding and applying the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort at a deeper reform.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As it stands, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new histories.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solutions are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state’s participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never come out of it" Sting in Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any." - Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a lot of reaction.
Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defence and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed in the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killing and who the victims, after all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I am about to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who has served above all the 95-year-old tensions (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can look for some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who guided their steps completely autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards the previously stated goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if someone is standing over them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much written about them.
Yes, of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts behind which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all of the world’s central banks and against countries where the central bank’s shares are not being waged or prepared for war (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the regime).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild central bank to the Bank of America, began to spend his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan for three world wars by a mason of the highest, the 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial dominions of Great Britain in particular, and the third was not to reduce the world population to anywhere from 0.5 to 1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves for their comfort and luxury suffices and do not consume so many other resources), the second was to abolish the colonial dominions of the United Kingdom, and the third was not to lead to the reduction of the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and so much luxury, and so much more, and so much more, and so much more, and so much more, and so much more, of the creation, of the creation, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same universe, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the creation, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the same, of the
The method that a group of the wealthiest families led by Rothschieldy works is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat the crisis like the one they provoked in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in assassinating the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start the First World War, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, militarily and economically unfoundedly, with the capitulation of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers of politics had to create a latent conflict situation by imposing such enormous war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then it was enough for them to instil in the Germans a strong enough force, a strong one, a strong one, a strong one.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds founded the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler got out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or whether everything he had planned to do was difficult to estimate, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, in any case, created the precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany's war reparations were earned for World War II, a third war camp was created by the State of Israel's declaration.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the victims in the front line of the fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s just consider how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice leads to injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to choose only their own candidates in the elections.
The current prime minister of Israel, the Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, a rogue to the international bankers, a rogue to the world, a rogue to the world, a politician who does everything to start a war with Iran that would, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan)
As David Rockefeller put it in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their conception is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at the birth of a chip, which will make it a totally controlled being.
“And he compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have on their right hands or on the foreheads of seals, that he may not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name.
This is to be understood: who has reason to count the numbers of the beast?
That number denotes a man, and that number is sixty-six.”
Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he occupied a crowd of protesting Islamist students at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohamed Réz P<0xC3><0xA1>hlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - to throw chess overboard could not afford it, because it would fundamentally threaten the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages, however, in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directed by Ben Affleck, Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six of its employees fled.
They ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador after a complicated outing.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping out an extravagant cover story – they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who toured the country’s locations for shooting sci-fi movies.
Combination of Genres
The plan, devised by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a plot - a series of Danny's partners can be an example.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no major differences in this).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a mocked actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it’s the first Affleck film not to take place in the director’s hometown of Boston.
At the same time, the sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that elevated the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotion of confusion and inconsistency that occurs when somewhere in the clear moves.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his collaborators in fictional scenes (a fake staff at a Tehran bazaar).
Too much going on in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer much in the film sense of tense scenes.
Quite successfully working with it little, sometimes thinking about reality - everything does not come out so elegantly (the scene in which the looming crisis at the Tehran airport diverts the phone call in America and the chase after the runway seems quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Argo, however, is the fluidity resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film is losing a bit of dramatic momentum, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, to appreciate the realization and retro style evocative of the thrillers of the 70s.
It's gonna be hard to pull off.
As a reminder of one still in a certain way of living history and proof of how exaggerated are the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but enough.
Rules for inflatable balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank charge, has now decided to announce a competition on "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"This has led us to the last event where the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Patrick Nacher, organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory mixing of biocomponents into fuels, which, as a result, harms nature, and a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of caged hens.
Critics have previously also faced a de facto ban on the use of the term butter or the removal of classic bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimetres long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now also vetoes the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show an "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by only harmonising existing non-uniform national standards, which have complicated trade.
The EU has already softened fruit and vegetable standards despite opposition from some countries, noting that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in the survey can also be the last year's EU regulation, according to which it must be mandatory for sold inflatable balloons to be notified that children under 8 years old are not allowed to inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has called for US research to show that balloons between toys are the leading cause of death of children from choking.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when blowing into travel muffins.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone holding an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, for example, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food supplies that could have been in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on the application for a grant.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, it had to be full of warehouses that he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic continues to have ports.
The European Commission has finally come out in favour of the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to obtain the grant was offered by the Ministry of Local Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), in particular they were to go to write a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While the regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to operate and develop more efficiently across the Union are, according to a number of experts, more deserving of recognition.
According to experts, a more serious problem is, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have imposed during the budget negotiations.
Emotions among the Czechs also arouse the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to the specific designation of its traditional products, although it will not always succeed in this fight.
After a six-year struggle with the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs used the designation Olomouc, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k.
Naming rum can only be carried by products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary has already been found, for example, dried carrots, mountain carrots and tr<0xC3><0xA8>bo<0xC5><0x88> carp, and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
The Pardubice Pencil and Burnt Pipes can also boast an EU trademark.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you know if you want to run for president?
I don't care if I'm a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I am not running for office.
But I can no longer see how the country has been robbing itself for the last twenty years, how thieves have been running around, people’s taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 and I'm an independent nonpartisan, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I said all along that I would go to the Battle of the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that we, as a nation, are indulging in pubs and televisions, but that we are trampling on anyone who wants to try to change.
To this are added the media, which dehonestize man and which confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I was paying journalists or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have gone into the battle for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can pass laws.
How do you want to solve it?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for guided tours to be a free trade, I managed to push it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, the vote will be rejected, and the citizens will be held back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a leftist or a rightist?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more on the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're kidding when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by important experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have passwords.
This is not enough in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, you will succeed in asserting, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side to push it.
If I were elected president, it would be no problem to organise a television live broadcast where I would ask the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell her why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality who will name the villains, it can be pushed onto the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
On a level I say that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, in six years I'll be done, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been around a lot of famous people, whether or not they're also running for Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported investigative journalist Jan Lorentz, who covered up the scams with light heating oils.
I ran with the idea that people are really unhappy, but now I'm on a roll.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate so that the changes would be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to examine the pure past of every potential side, and I don’t have the money for that either.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property claims, what's yours?
I estimate the private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have land for about 25 million, apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil and dishonesty.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own a $60 million property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for a campaign.
Do I owe you that?
I've made $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors indicates that there is probably no such interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I get as a senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t survive it, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not running for office.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
It has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I partially muted my activities.
For example, my representative will become a tour operator in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much did you as an entrepreneur get used to taking monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'll take away.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not only take place in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of books - 2 photos
"This building looks cheerful to me, it looks futuristic. Finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-fashioned libraries today voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a residence close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with a population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted iron-concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not inconvenient.
And so the city councils realized that there is only one way to become the master of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely brave column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and his ear.
And while the commission was still gazing awestruck around and shrugging its shoulders, the bold Maas made his gifts to himself according to his size, and ended his activist-motivated speech with the words, "Nice city town!"
So this is my proposal on the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain was completed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Hora knih was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town gray, which has so far been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is thanks to this richer with a bit of contemporary architecture.
In particular, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
First impression: reading Eldorado under the cheese lid.
A lift rides through the mountain massif, but you will discover real spatial and reading passions only when you climb the topography.
The glass interior is bright and clear from all sides, the floor of the burnt-out cabaret and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, there are bookshelves along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and there’s a large dark space in the middle that’s mostly inhospitable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader’s space out from the inside.
The inside of the Mountains of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a central office of household appliances.
A special treat are the black shelves for books, which are once a wall covering, once a window sill and sometimes a railing for the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even architects and construction engineers swear by the unknown building material with their heads twisted.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
So one day, in a farm in Frisia, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base under the roots of a millimeter of fleece made of synthetic material.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons and is then matured for disposal into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such an amount - was cast on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
With the effect of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored in a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figurines in flowerpots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly of the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology, despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools with the earth's heat.
Although the Mount of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden bindings, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The air in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even refers to as the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to dedicate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, optical gaps were first to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept proved itself.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young or uneducated she is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to U.S.-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow side of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for an observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? !
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
In the end, it was NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that is from the policy that was, so to speak, run by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is even more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as those in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in the national interest that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and by its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
It does play a role anyway.
But I would not like to attach too much importance to it, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, it does play an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the United States been damaged when Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, such as the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a break as the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has made clear its support for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration has, perhaps secretly, a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be taken in public.
I don’t think the differences in opinion are as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to align its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and instead have to push things forward from their own position.
This is what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role for obvious reasons.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, anti-German sentiments will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US is.
It must be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly decreasing, but the EU is currently not fulfilling this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they are uncomfortable and it will make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies the name, which is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it benefits from protection as long as it is not claimed by the actual brand owners.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law will prevail.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Forgers only need a few extra letters to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and Prada-Kny will be registered instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens the organizer with the records of the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected. An artificial name that also parasitizes at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several-storey commercial houses, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases are different, however, and he is acting under the authority of his mandants to prevent Chinese companies from being officially granted the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere by the trade mark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word is focused on "Bang Dakuan".
These are the women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not at fault.
"It hurts the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The mark will dilute, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, erasing questionable records in the trademark registry can be difficult and cost something.
Driving can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court rejected the lawsuits because the name was coined after a long period of "market reality".
When the plaintiff has bad luck, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
The known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with Sana, a company that recently took over the German pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are still allowed to use the emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not at fault.
The trade mark office CTMO admits that in 2010 there were shortcomings due to too few employees and space.
But last year, “the course of the work process has returned to normal from an emergency situation.”
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, up 75 percent from the previous year.
Still, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
That’s a record, and it means that China is behind the list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected on fees.
Simply put, this means that each sign-up costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against it is worth several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This company has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, had succeeded in abolishing its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg won the rights, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company’s archive, they even had to look through a hundred-year-old file to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered in vain "a high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You see what that means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a danger that the danger from the Far East will affect Europe as well.
And that's in case the impersonators get unprotected marks.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it has managed to refuse registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners should "apply everything that is in any way worth protecting, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Assault, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is tested - and in Swaziland orphans are happy about it after parents who died of AIDS.
The history of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there’s the bullshit: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women’s boats, and men’s moccasins look for bars on the parquet and quickly find them.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - rise, mum and chase each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he combines voices with his wildly wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi is trying out a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a homemaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choir voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that there are approximately 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after their parents died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40% of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child school uniform, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, Imbongi means "storyteller" or "he who glorifies".
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space, only sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been training songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the volume of the votes of the German choir.
40 percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of them still in simple clay or straw huts, and a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Essen, it is visible in the small, what stands the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity in themselves. It is not uncommon for them to die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but cleaned up everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, they have no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the Voices for Africa association, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who have died of AIDS, was founded almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mussels and itchiness belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is among the most affected?
Syphilis and gout occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydial infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), cappuccino, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV belong to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, among adolescents there are often human papillomaviruses.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the chin and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The danger of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from dirt and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"Together, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Essen," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can assert herself.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children showed up to school in their uniforms on time every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
Although the disease is so obvious across the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-approved way of life is also to blame for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who have spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different – unprotected contact.”
To at least support the cultural exchange a little, the Imbongi choir travels once in two, three years together across South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combativeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears for many wild border soldiers.
The route always leads to Essen, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Essen, there is light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an air line of 8,733 kilometers from here, to the rapping singers in the test room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, you can see that the light is shining here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimetres and perhaps even 20 metres thick.
This water is believed to have come from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not put the ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other basic elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, take part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, small windows to infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of a planet.
This cut-out from the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, the more poorly identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the star's birth hall.
This region where stars form — scientists call it the W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of dying stars was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The dwarf ring is made of material that the star extruded during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years from Earth, a new star is formed from gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors will stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear to the observer in this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the terrestrial continent has led to this nebula being named North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of extraordinary coloration.
This "mimenko" among the stars was able to capture the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope in full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Viral Galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years away Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, three-leafed), as the dark strips of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonose, astronomers have photographed the prelude to a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies have to be captured and a collision is inevitable.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can call it the nickname Southwinder.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a cutout of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1400 light-years distant nebula is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, has been recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called the UGC 1810.
This nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are giving birth to new young stars that are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe the stars a year before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical binoculars have grown ever larger — and the views they mediate are ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego from 1947 to 1975.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe with two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures on average 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap design method: the telescope is secured by a hook at an elevation angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equivalent to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any owner of the computer that provides its computational power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here - and honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters full and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to form a new giant telescope - with a diameter of thirty meters of the mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
It has been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets — especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will first be launched into space in 2018 aboard the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been showing for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.

Searching for footprints in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
We can call the ride of the Taly<0xC5><0xA1> mountains wildly romantic.
The microbus roams the road with many turns along densely forested hills, grassy rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
However, this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian Talysh ethnic group lives, about which it is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is experiencing a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This small town is proud of its too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-current.
The fabulous wealth for which the countries owe oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
Pilate Fatulayeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik intends to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talysh from the area, who are hundreds of years older. Fatulaeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
The museum’s controversial star, however, is sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, the age of M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>m seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136 he is said to have still begot a daughter.
So was <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov wrong at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of elderly people in Central Asia.
"A considerable number of elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik experience the biblical age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many elderly people live in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talysh.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulev museum believes that it is based on nutrition.
But the fact that it is the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem exactly believable from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzaeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercup, which he untiringly swings.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom are long-time grandparents.
There are also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical abs glass "armadu".
Mirzaeva's white teeth form the perfect line and under the scarf hides a long dark blond copy, which her son proudly unveils before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and kept their color.
"I've also never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for life.
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Geidar Aliyev took over the stable.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that surrounds the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the oars.
The elderly in Azerbaijan, at least, do not suffer from emergencies.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) every month. This is the ratio of the amount that can be used well.
And perhaps the long-grey son of Mirzayeva is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep divisions.
A future constitution based on sharia law is being discussed sharply.
The Egyptian president did not spare the pathos.
We need to make a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the “state of God” on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologizingly said that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds the title of Doctor of American University in Southern California, really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which were quickly approved by the 100-member Constituent Assembly, with the majority of Islamists, in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly a cause for concern.
As in the earlier constitutions, this proposal states that jurisdiction is based on the "rules of Islamic law".
But what does "rules" mean?
That was, and is, a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this highlights the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over all of Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislature, which would bring to justice a de facto deprivation of jurisdiction.
There are many interpretations in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values.”
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits the defamation or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad and his emissary.
However, it remains unclear what the disgrace is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the formulation that “offensive to people” is prohibited.
In this case, is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the Islamists’ excesses.
Tens of thousands of people rallied in unusual consternation on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to destroy the charter before it goes into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamd<0xC3><0xAD>n Sabb<0xC3><0xA1>h<0xC3><0xAD>, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel Laureate and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution was "a wasteland of history".
Through the service of short messages, Twitter accused the followers of Mursi that they want to carry out a "puppet against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," opposition politician Khalid Ali told Egyptian media.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a counter-demonstration, but cautiously not at Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Morsi, "Purify the land," and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably provoke a state similar to a civil war.
Clearly, Mursi’s supporters didn’t want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood has stated that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the polls decide in which direction the country should go.
The majority is considered certain in favor of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not exist even once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is predicted by Hafiz Abu Sa’du.
An eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were behind Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now there are no words 'human rights' even once," he complained in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa’da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of it.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You have created a monster that you can no longer control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for extra-scented fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
So you get the paralyzing smell of rakfissku, one of Norway’s biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and the ubiquitous smell hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather at a festival dedicated to, as it were, the most seductive food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General" who is responsible for the festival.
People all around us eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the fall.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly dulled with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival who was much wealthier than Norway until recently, are flocking to the country for work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, albeit a relatively fragrant part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often not included in the global news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still being mentioned with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22nd event."
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway lies in the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, presents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't pretend, we don't like to show off.
Norway treats its oil wealth very cautiously - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the strings on their bag firmly tightened.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat the squid," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow at the front for something to eat - I've had enough of the rakfisk.
Such a loty burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV broadcast in which a moderator with a butterfly is surrounded by a plate with a rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps armed with aquavit.
Or maybe evaporating all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a difficult start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting into work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sherpa and take over the nation’s leadership.
He is facing a difficult task.
Mexico was doing well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader differ even in his old homeland, the people’s and the vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered for good.
Citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the punchy and bumpy roads that were here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for President Pena Nieto's party, the Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and economy that our country so desperately needs.
After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vincent Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, much is expected from Enriqua Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a man with no substance.
He is a very direct man, very interested in the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Nestled under the highway overpasses, it is reminiscent of the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the self-governing village are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, an army was called in to help cope with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places next to a huge dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women had been murdered in Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pen Niet say he failed to adequately address the problem of women’s murder while serving in the office.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone was washing her body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were marks on him after the blows, and the post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old lady, troublemaker, and bookkeeper.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority during his tenure in office.
"I hope that he will be the same president as he was the governor," says PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what families of victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn’t complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's claim of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the rough handling of Manning in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein, at a cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of the weekly visits that Manning had made to the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no remorse for the indecency.
The cross-examination, which took place in the course of a hearing conducted on a defense motion to dismiss a case brought against Manning on the grounds of ill-treatment at the time of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had been convicted in custody.
An army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein along with Manning completed forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico detention facility, where he was held in heightened security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was rated as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility was rated as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various problems orally and that the officers who had visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but had not noted these problems.
"They recorded 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning responded that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime.
The army said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance for suicide) to protect it and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it here,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at a naval infantry base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was contemplating suicide in Kuwait, and once there he fainted because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very discouraging.
"My world has only shrunk to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a lightbulb, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face, when he turned to the other side in the night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint against the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's deposition, concerning the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked before guards and other fellow inmates at the morning count.
Manning stated that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
In a Friday hearing, Judge Manning said he had decided by order of his guards that he had a blanket to hide, to put off, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his incisors to injure himself, but did not do so.
Manning stated that that night his underwear, his eyeglasses and his eyeglasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted before a military court, the beginning of which is expected at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it planned to have Manning plead guilty to lesser crimes and that it would fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions of detention as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning had been held in compliance with regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security, and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extrangeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and my whole life I was called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irees" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italys."
So later I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my U.S. passport and stood in the front for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House this week.
On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under threat of arms to transfer half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, the remarks are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something a little critical about Mexico, you’ll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not with Mexico.
And even though we live the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans who belong to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they view us as a subservient race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don’t like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don’t feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make the relationship even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and push the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignant about the way their family members were treated in a substantially closer way.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the shootout between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodletting suggests that any such incident is futile.
Among the usual needless guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets hit Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly heel situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at the moment there are not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire closed on November 21, this week's fighting strengthened the cranes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the world’s most affluent and populous corners, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently being run by its entrenched rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists around the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hungry people from Hamas say the Islamic crescent is hanging around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/militia is ruling, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly bent on Islamism can take Bashar al-Assad down to Jordan, where he joins Jordan.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas’s cousin and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unyielding as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the latest round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet about the suicide bombers’ rights, in part because of the wall that encroaches on the West Bank, the main part of what will eventually be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements from encroachment by the international outcry that is stagnating.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why smear the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets like their fellow countrymen did in Gaza?
It would be better if we held them behind that wall and hit them with their heads.
Supporters of the hard line may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although Islamists, who gain power in Egypt and other countries, do not have Israel too much in love, their top priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than the spending of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
The start of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to stop the fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis, too, should look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination creates a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas – just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making the situation even worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody outbursts against Gaza that take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas will increasingly collect a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers are saying: the two states where Israel will transfer territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this thing.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must commit to halting arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than immediately offer virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally hesitant in his entry into the process.
That's sadly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia’s Ugly Cigarette Packaging Laws Have Entered Into Force
Inconspicuous green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, have come into force, and the logos and colors of the brands have been replaced by general olive green boxes with ugly pictures of sick parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborns sick with the effects of their own smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the brand name boxes that are printed in the same small font is mandatory from Saturday.
It is the most stringent tobacco-packing regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing this habit from its appeal.
It relies on studies that show that unless people start smoking by the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product,” says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a log with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others argue that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal against the law.
Ha said Zico had sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible stumbling block, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group the plan is targeting.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from the direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a marketing professional in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left to promote your products, the online space is an unbeatable place for you to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and got the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for violating the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries significantly trade with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack traffic in central Sydney, says it’s harder for him to level the shelves with single boxes.
"It took me an hour to load it, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's the end, let's close the store,'" he said, shaking his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with praise of boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our kids) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don’t have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience “I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn’t able to.”
Boring differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but wants to be.
He says that in apathy there is no need to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is “violation of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow running time.”
Boring can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read an article from the journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why, and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and dabbing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more alert.
“The research shows that children who are allowed to spin learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” said Professor Fenske.
We’ve all experienced boredom at times – the delay of my flight, the buzzing speaker, especially the long film.
Some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally incompetent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that “adultery is a prime time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “Is boredom good for you?”.
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling games, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Burning is a brain’s way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not in the long run.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun or drive independently, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain themselves, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant throttling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but the boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off."
In Colorado, there is no guide to the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was called in for possession of drugs and drug-using equipment -- petty offenses for which he was fined $100 each -- and given a court date.
'They treated us like criminals, 'said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote on legalizing a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the location rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana-related offenses have already been canceled here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults aged 21 and older with possession of a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But plaintiffs in more conservative Colorado counties have said they will continue to pursue existing marijuana-related cases, and are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This thing is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also shaking their heads.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the date of December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use, and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the state's liquor licensing board.
But as Mr. Smith has admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we could be guided," he said.
The Washington law, known as I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but legal ownership does.
And there are hellish mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance a state directive regarding "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade of cannabis within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently founded research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the City of Aurora sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute crimes involving possession of small amounts of marijuana by every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would “immediately” stop charging people with these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a tougher view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The response was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer accusing adults of holding small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed a deep rift among local officials in light of this large-scale state-green experiment.
For district attorneys, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national drug legalization test cases.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana hope the Justice Department will comply.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana deals in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to go out the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana trades allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on anti-drug policy to the president’s administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the progress of the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new marijuana trades, although it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into force next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we’re going to have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our municipality voted against this addendum.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today’s university students are not the only ones being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern-day wrapped Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far in the late 1980s, within two weeks of attending Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave it up because I objected to loving students in the side room.
Writer A. N. Wilson declared that I had left because I had been forced to drink from stale cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be asking why I'm pulling this off right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that a new generation of students on the right have suffered similar persecution since Wednesday.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Junior Association (JCR) claim that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and made to appear unwelcome.”
They ask for the creation of a position on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about a student political event that the conservatives described as bizarre and neo-Nazi.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other universities, conservative students say that because of the introduction of higher education, they are treated as "victim lambs".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "leftist influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Twenty-one-year-old Corpus Christi history student Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while nineteen-year-old elected OUCA president Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the JCR’s right-of-centre approach to people.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority by one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and stunningly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most intense.
A year earlier, the university had voted against granting the honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would tremble with fear.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students are meeting with each other and with professors, I got to taste the pollen that was supposed to come.
I have found that not only do the professors silently approve the labeling of conservative pupils, but they are also willing to take part in it.
The policy of mining strike, privatization and resistance of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced into the wood-clad listeners.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've had enough of this.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a cake-like face, was very gallant.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students nodded.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you're not too busy with social issues," Professor Pitt said.
I was crushed and returned to my room.
I was sitting alone at dinner at school when I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most of the conservatives pretend to be Labourers.
Later, at the local pub, I tried to pretend in a cowardly way.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economics, who (what an irony) went to Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years have unfolded before me as a purveyor of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote speeches to her.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and smallness, and for its tendency towards a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to move from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, seeking refuge with my uninvolved metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes grinned.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history declared in all seriousness that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even as I blushed inside, I admitted that my "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was beaten by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's paper every week.
My door was locked.
I shrugged inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crippled weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which to this day also hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine's got more elegance than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host the Valentina Garavaniho exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who, without his honored clients, could not be written.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian cream".
There is nothing wrong with loving a royal family.
"They at least don't stick a cigarette in a great rug like some of the wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy plenty and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentine always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.”
Valeria Mazzov<0xC3><0xA1> presents Valentina
The charisma of the designer is also not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It's been many years since we went to him for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he radiated and was feeling his spirit.
All the guests could feel important and loved thanks to him," recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Nativity Parade
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passageway that offers a role-playing exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passageway to observe the "crowd" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wear as the dress she chose in the costume of Jackie Kennedy with her costume on.
In the audience, the model’s names include Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer muse.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give 'spark' faces.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally came to an end in the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentin for the occasion of a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a ribbed waist and a top without shoulder straps.
It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully ... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
The "King" of Fashion
The gold stud of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create these silk dresses ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a drag of four and a half meters long it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his swaddling).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the pinnacle of fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honor in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandereur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor collect as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, calm, refined and perfect appearance," Princess d'Arenberg admits.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace on him."
When the princess says that...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the area of the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano gamble with their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make a living by mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day it has to rumble to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and when in contact with the air it passes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along crisp stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which stands 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes the exhausted carriers more than 40 minutes to climb up at a tortoise pace, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps, so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any trip could become a life, as happened to one French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are up, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been profiting in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Because it normally carries 70 kilos, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually takes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it seems like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, for collecting coffee, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day is paid and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is a Hindu."
Anto has asthma, he's not breathing well, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to collect its tax on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man caught in fate could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the job of a porter.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not stop boiling at night and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto goes into the crater and illuminates the path with a small flashlight, which is attached to the helmet and he bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry a basket of sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has a high income, it has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur due to cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to the carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they do not even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography surcharge, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), is chosen by the park rangers from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mussels.
"This work is for livestock, not people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working supporter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He is able to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will be able to work "as long as he can" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so assertive that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent sores of the respiratory system.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can weigh only 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in a volcano, which then three trucks take a steep path between the cisterns to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening a wide mouth that lacks several teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time is running out, but the constant misery of one of the world’s most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation – crafts performed by human mule in Kawah Ilyen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans cheat that they don’t have children, on career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Let's fulfill our civic duty and give birth to a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but yet – or perhaps that’s why – the video was massively extended to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local phrases such as "let's put a bow in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that with this advertisement they will be able to point out the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency’s artistic director, said he wanted to use the influence of music to help people fulfill “their civic duty.”
“It’s all about the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic that we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of the rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who does not take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
They will spend $1,300 per year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population ranking is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Office’s marriage and family department, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People thus have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been attempts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in the population, this has caused resentment among the local population.
On some Singaporean websites, there is an undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development began regulating the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of developer EL Developers, claims that their “boot boxes” sell far faster than larger homes.
“They are more popular, selling days to weeks faster than houses with a larger area.
That’s why they’re so much better for our money flow.”
However, they admit that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could be aimed at raising the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in a financial district in the city centre suggests they won’t have much of an effect.
“People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why a lot of people put it off,” says the young official.
"Let others have children.
But for me it’s important to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is Singaporeans who have the final say about starting a family.
What's private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any violation".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Journalists from elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be “something entirely of their own” on a personal level and as a “user name and password” when it came to social media.
“I wouldn’t reveal my biggest secret,” Jorge, 10, said in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secretive, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm putting some nice pictures on FB, or pictures of how we play.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn’t share a picture that wasn’t mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write derogatory or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I have set up a Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them told him anything, nor did he ask for his address or phone number.
"If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These guys are not strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend has been blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not log out of the account.
"She just activated her private mode."
Then it explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasov<0xC3><0xA1>, a teacher of English and a graduate of the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents in social networks to be properly oriented, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
He states that: "The Internet was created as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasov<0xC3><0xA1> notes that academician Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are just learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature".
Also, to be considerate – as far as the surroundings are concerned – at a time when what they most want is to be liked, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences.”
According to this specialist, the most effective way for children and adolescents to show what privacy is, is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porrasov<0xC3><0xA1> also mentions some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your photo the way you published your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you're tagging the people in the pictures from the celebrations, did you ask those people for permission?
And one more thing: Do they always need to know what you’re doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the internet is governed by respect, morality, and other principles, and the same should be true on social media,” he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and an educational counselor explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand any kind of fraud, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences of setting up an online account.
For example, with regard to age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
South America Summit Ends and Lima Statement Not Published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Peru today ended without a Lima Declaration, which was notified and which was allegedly signed by seven current presidents.
The EFE has repeatedly sought to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur, but representatives of the foreign ministry and presidential offices, who initially determined that the document would be published after the summit, said that it would later be published on the website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission is prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some governments who were present at the talks, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the talks was a list of participating presidents, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to ask for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent a media e-mail with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although it was eagerly requested by the press.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be seen that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that broadcasts were made for all journalists, but they completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru’s President Ollanta Humala and Chile’s President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday, after hearing a defense speech by both sides, to discuss the dispute that has started Lima against Santiago.
"We will scrutinize and enforce the verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said in a statement.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice’s decision was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact this week, thereby expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia’s error in that decision.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the recall of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humal was given the task of opening the morning speeches and concluding the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read out a final document in which he said 16 agreements had been adopted and work was planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which is the reason for the expansion of residency agreements".
He said that actions are being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) is not to have a winning nature, but to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” added Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different places in South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,” he said.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the cross-sections of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and another two relate to better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring her back to the Union of South American Nations," she said.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is integral and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet on Saturday in Mexico with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega, to discuss with respect the verdict of the International Court of Justice regarding the dispute over the maritime boundary, which is being disputed.
"It is possible that I will meet tomorrow (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I can tell President Ortega that we will conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and transparent way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta.
At the summit, EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he championed the project of creating South American citizenship, which Unasur’s member countries support.
"There is a need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still return zones that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president has said, among other things, that he agrees with the overcrowding of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states will be reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," Assange said in a reference to Ecuador's political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to undergo interrogation in Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "his own Swedish legislation allows the interrogation to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be carried out in L<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC3><0xA4>nd in Velv<0xC3><0xAD>dor".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange would suffer a deterioration in his physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But there is a danger that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is confined to a small space with no possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would be good for everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that Lond<0xC3><0xB3>n's exposé to
“We don’t negotiate about human rights, we don’t use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n is leading a series of proceedings at various European institutions,” he said.
He said: “If the UK issues a permit tomorrow, it will all be over.”
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be brought to an end tomorrow.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, explaining that he definitely does not tolerate “the under-averageness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the vile and depraved politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemony nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador", and suggested that, if re-elected, "he will continue to make changes in the right way and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto on Unasur’s membership at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d’état cloaked in legality” because in fact it “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay.”
The Ecuadorian president also said that he considers it "completely appropriate" for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time when the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is currently not accepted.
"This is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
It is necessary to consider them widely, so that they can be overcome and there is an opportunity to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is pending before the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international forum if both countries undertake to accept a verdict, no matter how harsh."
In connection with the possibility of running in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will be out of public life.
“I have never personally been interested in power, but situations as unjust as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would be out of politics.
If we lose, the same thing happens to me.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new health treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
“I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who says President Chavez has gone to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the president's health," he said.
The head of state of Ecuador attended today the sixth summit of heads of state and governments of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are now the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he recounts, recalling a moment of truth the doctor was trying to "slightly mitigate" but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own shoulders and began to inform himself about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic did not say goodbye to him, “because he had a cutting wound.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused destruction of the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the appearance of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "the success of the disease means that the length of life of the patient, who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the Department of Health, in a press release.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 CD4 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, with the flight not affected by it.
Simply put, this means that someone diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can “live without problems for up to 75 years if treatment is followed,” the doctor explained in an interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (anniversary of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far in May, but universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die from the consequences of the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not exhausted the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, in the late stage of the disease."
He adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection already manifests. The only thing that needs to be done in order to affect the overall mortality more is the disease to be diagnosed earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests on a large scale, after finding out".
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he has also suffered from a disease that has already caused him a sarcoma.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather do it three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercising, taking medication.”
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, said in a statement.
"Let them get tested. If they've taken risks, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who investigates information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
"In places that are dedicated to this task, the distribution of condoms has really increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Teenagers are among the most susceptible to new infections.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists, and medical staff who want to avoid teens, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffectual distribution. Let the condoms not only be behind the counters, but let the hundred be found in the dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not about promiscuity.
It’s not even about “paying them a beer and a motel,” as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who are already leading a sexual life," he said.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
In Mexico, this condition ranks fourth in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of the disease is sexual, 6% is blood and 2% is perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, because for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment passed by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as set out in the Mexican tender, sets a bad precedent for any national firm with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of the stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hale at the bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves the Mexican company defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three irregularities.
The opening is to say that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States Insolvency Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth District Court of Appeals says that the main procedure sets out the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, which is determined by the arbitrator of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the branches of the internal company structure, when the debts of the parent company Vitro to the branches are recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been reached.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Institute of Compulsory Liabilities was responsible.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds of "supposeds", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 – against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sady will appeal to the Court of Appeal for a new assessment, so that the assessment can be carried out with the full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because initially only three of them voted.
If it does not succeed here, it will require, as an appeal, a review of the process by the higher courts, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is significant that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae service, detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Competition Act and pointing out that the company had made it easier to comply with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with the law.
Furthermore, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.

Unnoticeably, the Mexican Air Force’s several-month criminal complaint against Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, a former owner of the company accused of fraudulent conduct, was on the table and, according to the pilots’ union, the container had already run out.
An instance led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, accusing it of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, during which the IXE selected 198 million pesos from the F/589 fideicomium on behalf of the Mexican Air Force.
The funds were probably directed to the purchase of the shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As we know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of local and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens met over the weekend, who approved the creation of the association, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from the "land with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would at the bottom include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) organization was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.

As is well known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and thanks to him has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was before he was hit by a brain stroke on a wheelchair in 2008, having been involved in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior category player, player of the BSN National Basketball League, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n team in the National Basketball League, or as a president.
“I’ve held many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as being president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, managing director of the national team and chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled while visiting reporters of Primera Hora’s newspaper at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not go overboard in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and commemorative items from his long career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest momentum of all the guards, those who recall his performance in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time he celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“It has been my best years, the one I have enjoyed the most, because I have had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as an owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach at the time at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, telling me, ‘I have a mature two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me the player Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon a championship win, then Gauss would contribute to the next one.”
He enjoyed the championship, when he played for the team of los Vaqueros, Gausse, but only remotely, because in 1988 he already served as president of the basketball federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy’s place in the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in the 1989 Olympic qualifier in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitch," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and scratched out a United States team that was quite similar to the one that blew up our bronze for the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivase, Fica L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>na" (Ortiz), but also young men (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team at will in 1990.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition, but managed to win a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualifiers in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players excluded due to a fight in the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we have won the gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved at this level such results as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Not to mention his performance in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the world?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things that I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the boys from Ponce would play only in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play a lot of games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world-renowned for starring John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died on Friday afternoon of complications associated with cancer, according to an official family announcement given to the Associated Press by the Dallas-based production company Warner Bros..
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he loved best,” his family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at a hospital in Dallas," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him very much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the series aired in Dallas, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (genius) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it wasn’t until Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that he was taken to the starry top.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the work of full emotion, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation by viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in the betting offices.
This also helped this work to achieve a record in tracking.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the conclusion of the 1983 MASH series, which watched 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his brother-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a greedy businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), an alcoholic, to be locked up in a medical facility.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman as someone who was "excellent on and off the screen" on Friday.
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second series have already been filmed and the sixth has just been filmed," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there were no statements from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped patients who were afraid.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "do not be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take this semester’s course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible allure: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long count” due to come on December 21st was caught by many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what would happen to him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget rift that some call the "debt of Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is drawn, a place where Christians theorize the end of the world.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester it's ever been," Charmé told students this week at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
“When you look at what’s happening in the world today as if we have 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptically minded.
And that’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
Barry Vacker, an assistant professor at Temple University, teaches a course on “Environment, Culture, and the End of the World.”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We understand why these ideas expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, probable, believable, and impossible,” says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, joined forces to organize a course with the simple name End of the World.
“We don’t join 2012 because we always expect to be able to set the course again if the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “threat of destruction,” students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work “until the very evening of the predicted end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It's spread out in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-medium students who turned 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received an email asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the field of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confidant student, let alone a professor, has said that he believes in the date of the end of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prediction, and in a way, we’re rejecting it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations has caused the Internet.
"People don't think about it," he said.
This is the case in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is giving a lecture in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew of a course there on the “end of the world.”
"The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception at the highest office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of last judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several of them have said that they intend to go to the celebration of the "end of the world".
"I think I'll call a few friends to laugh together," said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
