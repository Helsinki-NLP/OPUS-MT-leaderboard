The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they take them for monkeys.
Continuation between some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, by the suggestion that the name should be changed by MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
The debate took place on plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be ridiculous.
A member of the Labor Party said that his group was concerned that the new name "rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "pure" and "pwp" means "cuck".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the word "w" in Welsh is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the amendments, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed much support for the name of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the Commission preferred members of the Galés Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on the inactivate of the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians code the urns in reference to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has taken a long time insisting that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would make the vote forgotten.
However, the rapporteur's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep quiet while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there was once a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or the other."
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people are socializing in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood to which people usually go."
As for the churches, fear that the money of the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they will come back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of owners of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of those churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the streets of the 125th Street, a trade street in Harlem, who resisted to hire and climb the black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as the frigids of the Johnson father made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of his father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the cartoon as "the camps of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the biggest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who take up St. Martin during the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the secular leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parishioner, the organ that governs parishioner and which is composed of secular leaders, wrote the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "is trying to affect the costs" together, even though he did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frigates complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hits a boy while fishing salmon in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of bats in California on the first day of the storm of that cruise.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that it was about half an hour walking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help crying, when he was born with a group of people to help get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only an emotion to fish a languid, but that he soon realized that he was shouting "They did me!
They've been working on me!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
"I will give everyone who comes out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter to the Council's children's hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
Unknown type of shark responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they would split up a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma damage at the top of the tower.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami's, Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the great stores full of specialists' assistants.
As part of the considerable interference in the UK's beauty market, which goes up to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and household products fall, the biggest racers with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the living rooms that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its supply of beauty products up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique makeup so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sansbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, not south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online purchases and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people that they visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the facilities will increasingly appear to commercial centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount tents like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of tents, as he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernize its departments of pharmacy and beauty was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute pharmaceutical revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business formed by 281 tends to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the surroundings for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all needs and attractive locations and practices means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "burning" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "furish" after the TV show Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones throwing sparks when he withdrew from his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furnished" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tight meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he had no time to devote him to the home clothing brand and accessories of both, True.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving True, Jones picked up a plane to Britain and addressed one of his vacation residences.
One source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left an atonyms to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products that come from kitchens and candles to clothing and textiles for home, and that it could still delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couple were together on vacation, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV I'm to Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business".
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a few of his own presidents" and for being so positive about the Nordic leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he's putting his voice on "telexer."
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the US to the first steps of disarmament in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his half speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: to finish the tests with missiles, to help free the hostages and to bring home the remaining US soldiers.
And he defended his insolent strategy when talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said signaling to the crowd that he was right in front of them.
An earthquake and tsunami destroy an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their assistance.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters were built for tsunamis, it is not usual to find them on the other side.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling among many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will go to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign turned around to improve the damaged infrastructures of Indonesia, and produced money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final right to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the score goal in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge has received a pass from Herman Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea's porterery with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the balloon with his left leg before he shot a shot at the second pole.
The balloon flew over the area as it moved up to the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Riszabalaga Kepa that jumped in the air and entered the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball as hard as possible, so I tried to make as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Come to Kante and say a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked in 25 minutes.
The Azuli's predecessor passed the score ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the middle of change and entering the Liverpool field..
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful walk deep leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up in the second floor marking with a gunshot that Alison Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool boasts Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own thing with the videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of Indonesia's tsunami was increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the ruins of the buildings that came down with magnitude 7,5 earthquake on Friday and which caused waves up to 6 meters, according to a press release the voicer of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the ruined buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman died in a coma.
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds on John Street, and was arrested by a 32-year-old suspect of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from him a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with us anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the command box that comes in contact with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbour of Birkenhead and that he was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the families most close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that they wouldn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just known they can't come back in within an hour.
You heard a police officer tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman in the scene crying.
I don't stop saying 'it's horrible.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the line with another van just outside.
Several officers remain within the cordon watching the block of apartments.
To anyone who has information, you are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contact Crimestoppers on the 0800 555 111 phone number, quoting the 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by his fanatic and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and to "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Westminster Palace became objective.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell mistakenly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, that now, as a defender of parliament before the external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not a full representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the 17th-century media conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig snuck a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a southwestern market in China.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the so-called, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and blood cover near a cutlery in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A fat pig is prepared to put the vaccines on the pigs in a tent on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he traveled with his cousin on Wednesdays from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door giving him another adjacent cut.
He said there was a big man with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, about 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and sneezing," said the cousin, named "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Even though they're not very common, there have already been cases of pigs that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of nearly 300 kilos spattered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregón was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs do not usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "dispatcher.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the south-west of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that the Rosa furcan weakens as it flows over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and south-west of the United States during the coming days.
At 5 o'clock in the morning of Sunday, in the east, Rosa was a category 1 fugitive with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected Rosa to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture to the north, which will penetrate south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitations of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, flood currents and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
The large tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, rain is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2, especially over much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deterioration conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise to venture into the desert under a threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and electric storms will bring locally harvested winds and dust.
The valley will bring strong rains locally to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could in turn cause a flow of smaller debris and narrow roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet season.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be a witness of large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
On occasions this implies significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we will see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the U.S. center.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
New York could reach the 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains break their routine programming for a new last Friday's time: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation of a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's a hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh made him touchable by being drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported on Fridays that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other chains that relayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch television from their offices.
To make an idea, it's a hearing similar to that of a football final or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the Office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by demonstrators when he tried to enter a road elevator at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while he was being picked up, live on TV in the CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator closed, he added that he would have more than to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable lines were broadcast directly hours after the Judicial Committee had to vote to move forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the appointed one next week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused who criticised her plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to prejudice national interests.
The Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Another interview with him on the cover of the paper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the oranges from the other side was "totally absurd".
Killed Wade Sims: police arrests Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of the shootings that ended with Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released the video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police said that Sims would lose his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the gate of the scene and said they contain Simpson's DNA, according to the affiliated CBS channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wade.
The defense informed him that he was charged with a $350,000 loan.
The East Baton Rouge Forensics Office issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the state police fugitives' unit of Louisiana, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police are the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local forces for their "dilence and search for justice".
Yeah, he was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the basketball for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 turns.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball instructor Will Wade said the team was "suffered" and "immulated" by Wayde's fallout.
"This is what we worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano ash about Mexico City
The ashes that rock the Volcano Popocatepetl came to the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after they detected activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing a number of shocks and tremors.
The images of the social networks showed fine layers of ashes in the parabrises of Mexico City neighborhoods like Jochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano at 72 kilometres west of the capital since a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Coping between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the anti-disruption police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of proseparatists masked by the anti-disturbing police found eggs and paint in dust that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that usually be sheltered by tourists.
There were also refrigerations later that same day with the police, who used the porcupines to contain the loorta.
For a number of hours, independent groups that were coercing "Neither forgetful nor forgiving" faced unionist protestors who were shouting "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independent region one year after the reference of October 1 celebrated by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event was also produced but they were forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
"We lived one of our best moments last year.
I have seen my parents cry with joy when they can vote, but we are now under attack," he said.
Despite gaining a balanced victory, though decisive, in the regional elections last December, this year the Catalan independent parties fought for the momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in self-taxed exile or detained in waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"There's always more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament in elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: they arrest a man after a car is stopped against a house
three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car stopped on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
The police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the raid and the building in itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a fight against the car was fired at some time.
Menga's goal gives Livingstone a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ended in victory
The uplifted Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second victory in 18 games as an instructor at the Ibrox Club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to meet a level that lay after the hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team keeps running out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they're inflamed with the leader, the Hearts, of which they're separated by eight points.
But sooner the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
However, Livingstone continues to be indicted in the division by the sixth consecutive party; the chief trainer, Holt, still does not know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of weak visitors
Holt's team must have moved on a long time before they scored, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-shoot did not cross the threshold of the portery; next, the shoot of Alan Lithgow came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the portery.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put the visitors at risk in the games to stop the balloon.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingstone made a bag in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined their efforts to fix Menga, which touched the balloon and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession but met with an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from being done by Garmat Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
The Rangers' guard, Allan McGregor held a shot at Scott Pittman's weight, and Lithgow sent the ball out another shot at Livingston's balloon.
Many cross-steps in the Livingstone area were produced that were constantly fired, while two requests for punishment were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to Glenn Middleton's replacement.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
'And united, they were excellent and still surpassing expectations in their ascending path.'
Your game style and players have only changed since you returned to the highest level, but part of the merit is Holt by the way you have driven the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a perfectly organized defense, while Menga did not give them a breath all over the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the order of Gerrard, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
Last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All a call of intent for Rangers, which is found in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to eat in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO's allies.
They focused on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan directed the Colony to open a new giant mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 to meet in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflect the division in front of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist fails to hit a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car came around in London.
The accident took place near the cross between the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street streets, a transited street in Deptford, in the south of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (Summer time in Great Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in an atrophy with escape on Childers Street a little over a mile and a half of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police showed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street shutters and buses have been diverted and advised to drivers who avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers are injured in the disorders
Six prison officials were injured in an altercation in high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at the HMP Long Lartin of Worcestershire around 09:30 (summer time in Great Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tordo" unit of specialized officers came to take care of the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officials received attention for slight injuries on their faces.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "The prison staff has been deployed especially trained to deal with a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disruption officers had to go to prison to calm down a revolt in which the staff was attacked with billing balls.
The furthest Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen at the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane is going through the South-West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday of West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south coast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported in a Twitter publication that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a radius of 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service range from 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the Bordo Mogollón de Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Grand Conca could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible total isolations of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is very affected by the droughts.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, the Rosan will play land on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing power.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at night of Monday.
It could rain with great intensity in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important flood risk.
"Wait for the total precipitation between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2," weather.com reports.
Then, Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and, next, will continue going up across Arizona and will enter the south of Utah the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or what's left of her is the strong precipitations in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the South-West Desert of the United States," the Furacán National Centre reported.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water drums and waste streams in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder while finding a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, the Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Great Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained "stable".
According to Somerset's police, three 17-, 18- and 20-year-old boys were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the phone of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh 'suffered the mosque and anger' of the Democratic Party
"Vowing by Judge Kavanaugh is voting to refuse the challenging and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a myth in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charge that she assaulted her sexually decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial on his charge.
The president said Saturday that that day the "US" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with an imploded public service history," he said, addressing the crowd of Western Virginia admirers.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican results in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is "to resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh takes place before Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the Republican Party.
Indonesia’s seismic and tsunamis cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities informed the Saturday that at least 384 people had reported, many of them were dragged by giant waves that broke in the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of Palu, when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the Luccofusco, leading the lives of many and destroying everything to its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they failed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a prison ring in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, dragged everything I found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami would travel high sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and were able to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs spread by the national disaster management agency showed a lot of destroyed tents and buildings, torn bridges and torn bridges and a water-circuit.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) stated that energy released by the huge Friday earthquake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals shopping centers and hotels came down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, he declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications remained "totally paralyzed and no information" from Dongala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday because it had not reported the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, even though officials said waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of a fan shared on social networks, you can listen to a man who's on the last floor of a building screams frenetically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In the matter of minutes, the water hits against the edge by taking in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the writing immediately.
The seismic and tsunami caused an important shutdown that led to the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities say the army has already begun to send cargo aircraft from Jacarta and other cities, but the evacuations continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The victim balance of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey of World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where the employees repatriated in shelters of wool raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of moving forward with disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing them from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can open up to international aid, but it has not yet reached that point.'
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the missing ones were caught in the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that alleviated the depressing argument of the natural disasters."
Saturday they took a kid out of a dumpster.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was two days behind the scars with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the parapentist community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only a gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Roban $26,750 while reloading a boxer in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press note, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car emptied a box in the leisure complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoning the scene, but the police did not realize how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact the Newport police calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West bears the name of Ye
The Kanye West's name is changed by Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be previously known as Kanye West."
For some time now, the 41-year-old West has been known to the nickname Ye, which used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the program, which cancelled her assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," she said that same year West while she was talking about her record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous boys who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, even though this year he announced he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also caught up by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obador, agreed not to use the military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloodthirsty reprisal against the students arrives.
Lopez Worker promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "I would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were dragging across Latin America.
Lopez Worker promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional IA Kai-Fu Lee, Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should duplicate the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even though the U.S. lacks a formal strategy about IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it is intended to be number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicateing the budget for research in IA would be a good start, as the other countries are much more behind than the US, and we are looking for the next great advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could duplicate the chances that the next IA achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with higher score and later was executive at Microsoft Research of Google's branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work hard to get government bags, Lee says.
"China is not the one who is taking the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university genes to work in IA.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in IA.
"I think you should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China published its Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Chinese Natural Sciences provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industrial and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selection of artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
Instead of the NSF, I'm currently investing more than $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence did not register movement for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block requests for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours in the north represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists claim that the change would prejudge the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach 50 per cent of the minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the reference paper was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The name change defenders, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to obtain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO in Macedonia, one of the emerging countries from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have voted for the country's future, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament said they would score the result of the vote and make it final.
Change of nine would require a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
The State Elections Committee stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularity was recorded.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the name of the country that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads high and not by the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO accession will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote yes.
In order for the reference to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first important blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, across all of Brighton's defense and ends up marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took note of Brighton's defence with Manchester City's 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the goal of minute 65.
The previous Argentine took a walk in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading the open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green shirts.
A defense was challenged before several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English predecessor used the first tow area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems on his foot," said the City trainer, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"Let's say she plays 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he marked it at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the face of the Prime League.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the balloon at the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The bluesmiths put the ball in the porter before they left the camp.
The city will face the Hoppenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the Rockies party.
With the Nationals outside the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still any involvement in the elimination for the Rockies, which brings an advantage to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with the victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opener will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to get Scherzer into a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom would his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
The right of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a half in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding the election of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't, but I really do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Now you see this terrible radical group of Democrats, look what's going on now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and miscarriage.
They don't care who does the damage, above who they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we'll never give it to him."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct."
"And they've seen it in the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "angrily, walnuts, liars and liars."
He named the Senate Judicial Committee, quoting Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong support from the public.
"Do you read your answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Mmm. Come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party isn't that open anymore.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
after all, I am the last of a number of laborers who are not well received, and everything to say to our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, random issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of the eight years I have been a laborer, the committee's meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and that all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when fellows who were going to share a similar political vision began to expect me to stand up and adopt positions that I would never agree with, whether in the field of national security or in the single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and actually from a little bit like what I say, there's a tremendous allotment and attacks on the social networks censoring the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Laborist party.
And I don't care only about myself.
In fact, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed to me are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of "untrusted" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrower in view.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head shut, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't put myself in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of thatcher's government that literally let my class fall, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could possibly confuse my political positions and that I do not agree with the party's current direction.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party's leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting as I consider the best interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invited Child
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but it is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this party threat from the First League of Tenent.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only invitable team in the ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk-taking, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our party and we're still in doubt, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
The trial at the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he turned a shot into a solo, leaving the marker 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who left the camp on the floor and, from the resumption, Ayr made further progress through a trial by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The captain in the function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose quit having another player with a Bruce Colvine test that was not consumed at the end of a very pressure period.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placarding Climo when he had no balloon, McPjherson scored a trial from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he almost made it from the resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth test of the local team.
Still Game protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, appears to be prepared to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that a restaurant company's director was appointed.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-sponsorates with his old partner Greg Hemhill.
The two announced that the next nine season will be final, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosper business of Glasgow restaurants".
'The sea is ours': internal Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a shipyard covered with equipment in La Paz.
The public buildings are wearing a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are denied the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Getting it is a duty."
In the sealess Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources continues to live, just as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course awaits a positive outcome," Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's judgment on giant screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Court will stand in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's concession from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Indian president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot to play in the judgment of Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that it would not change much if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adapt Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicate that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert on international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The theme of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate says.
The charming rhetoric of Morales has undermined Chile's good will, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new phase of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
I made a call to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been stagnant for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a utopia" that the United States' continued sanctions and objections to a declaration that put an end to the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalized skepticism that Pyongyang seriously talks about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second cumin Kim-Trump.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or be completely covered in the sun, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered on the gateway a series of extravagance accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that amazed the audience with the purest style of the Week of Paris fashion.
Impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most surprising creations out to the gateway.
Valentine's main piece was an exaggerated hat adorned with a wide aba imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were sledgehammers, a magic hat and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had the hairy lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high knife.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the forks and the tube, and another a depleted ice cone.
And if it's huge fashion, it's lucky.
The fashioned people preach that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomba", the ball hat with a 60 centimeter abate that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark of worship behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks took out another great creation: a beach bag almost as big as the model attached to a bathroom that carries it.
The orange pouch bag decorated with rafia floccos and finished with a white leather strap, was the highlight of the Spring Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in Paris's fashion week.
The stylisticist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and big beach bags will reach the tents next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for surplus accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community materials.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English grades), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a study plan to measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that will reach his head.
But if you talk to him in his own language, he'll reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an outstanding education.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students received a mandarin honorary record, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students, also achieved an outstanding one.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are being given the same consideration as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and any kind of school programmes.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why employers are required to cover their vacancies.
So language skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with the ability to live like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language as well as to keep a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those from developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others rely on languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to win, whatever their future is.
We cannot deny that at this point, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the sailors who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team trainer, Like Walton, announced that James would play the initial pre-tamp against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to decide how many minutes you'll play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Laker's reporter, Mike Trudell, posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training from the beginning of the week, they asked James for his plans at the time of six Lakers' parties.
At these heights of my career, I don't need pretempt games to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigns tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It'll be the first of the 5 meths of Trump's scheduled for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on a suspended confirmation so that your candidate will cover the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, given that the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is Trump's half in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's half in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's half in West Virginia following via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the issue of the trial held this week to the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense for the allegations of improper sexual conduct and has suspended the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of myths is to help the Republicans deal with the November elections with a new impulse.
Therefore, these five halfs that Trump will give next week have as their goal "to dynamite volunteers and sympathetics while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season," Reuters said a Trump campaign speaker who preferred not to be nominated.
In the middle of the night, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, it could gather the sympathizers of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep the hope alive to the individual parties on Sunday
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's forum could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They've had an advantage of six points and now they're four, so I guess we'll take that as a little impulse," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to be encouraged, among other things, by the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points four.
Speeth has been fatal from tea to green and is preaching with example.
Those gutural screams were made stronger as he progressed his round, making a crucial putt to empatriate the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
When I got the putt that made them win the game on the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It's the only thing that's left to these players now.
18 holes to let go of the stick.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes Friday morning.
That route, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals fighting on Sunday, and could not have more popular players to win when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fired Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourballs, when he and Alex Noren got married.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they'd never been close to leaving.
But there's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the way they can change a strategy in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage the last day, but this forum session has also shown that the US Team has a hard fight, something that some, especially the Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired two formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty getting up four points to the marker in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who was trying to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning's fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursoms, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points followed, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four initial parties in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they matched perfection to defeat a decoupled Woods and American novel Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without a penalty or glory, showed occasional lightnings of brightness, but now lost 19 of 29 parties in the fourballs and foursomes and five followers.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's furballs, came back to meet his wife Henrik Stenson in the fursoms on a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference point for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 again in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team goes up four points in the individual, even though as the current trophies holder, Furyk's team only needs to mount to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had increased his confidence in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "significant measures to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming nuclear testing camps and commit themselves to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response by the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first for us."
While Ri recaptured the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active US president and a Nordic leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump was guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive action, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "man fire you on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
The Trump Wednesday said there was no time for that, and that "it takes two years, three or five months at the same time."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey said to the UN Security Council: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with firmness and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had progressed, in just a few hours that North Korea reported to him for making "mafia requests."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures he requested were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of machist culture to study all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, developed the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
'At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helped with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that the students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The one-time course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain failure, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe you have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending the entire night awake still exists, and it adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who were in need of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps enough and has a good sleep must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid getting tired, as the lack of sleep makes the brain enter in incisive mode, which makes him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, please, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to overthrow the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when the Dolly Menga attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory at home since the 4-1 win in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a trainer, who left his team at eight points of the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a little inspirational alignment of the Rangers never gave the feeling that he was embalmed.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingstone went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a different goal.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated for a head injury by the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingstone that he put a point on the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized together drowned his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingstone did much more when they had the balloon.
They could have been marked in only two minutes when the short pass of the first time in Menga sent Scott Pittman to the porter of Allan McGregor, but the central camper lost this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense companion, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second floor.
The Rangers took control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have to have asked for a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the arbitrator, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only held two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Ibrox guard Liam Kelly had only problems with Lassana Coulibally's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in 34 minutes could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers have failed again in the face of the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the balloon for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the rest when changing Coulibally by Ryan Kent, but it almost had an immediate effect when the jurdo made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingstone kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long balloon after another.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow got his head off the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he met with Jacobs, but Thomson went back to the fat sight.
German: Geiger's inventor
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACTED... was the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger accountant.
A pear of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (“The Coronado Camps”), played by those vaqueiro scientists apparently insolvent Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting these auricules, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, sure you're crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein for various types of cancer and inject it again.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of various types of cancer", including those of mom, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of the patient's immune cells and "esinalas" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded a speech for Trump using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat for its appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was supported in the study after a confusing presentation in which he praised US president Donald Trump, and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If you were concerned about racism, you would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire played by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the demands for sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't issued, Chris Rock went up the images of West critique on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that there was a bad time in the builders because of their heads.
"They went with me in the builders.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They scared me!
And then they said I was going to the peak," Washington Examiner said.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm gonna get my dick?" saying I'm going to "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try with love."
His comments provoked abstention in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed to be embarrassed, he informed the Variety magazine, with the following witness that a person who was there gave the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapist Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people confused with an interpretation of song I love it ("Love me"), dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you FOR FACER FOR MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "to be who he is and that is absolutely wonderful".
"That's all, I chose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or by supporting their art) who I think is embraceing and spreading an ideology that is prejudicial to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "to be officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogger had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Posts for attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
It is hoped that the accused will be brought before the Belfast Supreme Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the duties.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of machista hero, saying that such roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo (#EuTamenn).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong at this moment. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit thinks that television can partly be responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to its very male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequela or sequela of Game of Thrones when the series reaches its end next summer, claiming that "just enough horses and battlefields".
As of November, Kit will represent a Reposition of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believed that his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life from here forward," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been virtually reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in interim terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has been extended.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters says that a staff member will filter data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereit".
"Truths, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters commented in a Twitter statement.
According to the report, the disseminated information included the particular addresses and phone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on inappropriate sexual behavior charges against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," the Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were committed as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible for any way of filtering this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and a complete lie."
The subsequent Waters statement raised online criticisms, including those of the former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This mess was done with anger," Flescher wrote.
"You'll understand you don't have a temper to be a Congressman.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
It should not be challenging.
He must not question the accused's motives.
It must remain approachable and serenely."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the response of Waters to the criticism of judges Kavanaugh's democrats, to whom the critics accused themselves of looking too angry during the youth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" shared on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We will make sure to discover the culprits," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Critic of Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in the new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this parody and comedy action by Johnny English, who began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire be converted about the obviously stupid issue that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent character of Johnny English's naked eye and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comical creation designed for non-anglophone film territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his stanzary claims of a daring glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a guy from Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson interpreted once in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, in which he planted chaos at his step.
There's a couple of good times at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while he uses a medium-sized armored suit and the rotor steps make a brief shock against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps out, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" movies, like 007 and Impossible Mission, are already using comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if humor had been directed to children rather than adults, and in my opinion, the extravagant disadvantages of Johnny English are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's movie jokes when incarcerating Bean's character.
Now the permanent argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent who is in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the challenge for a prime minister in conflict, who is already suffering a total crisis of political impolarity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost seems Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your in-depth intelligence advisors that as all active spies were committed, you have to get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the Academy of Spies to a rock school.
They bring English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering companion, Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the misconceptions of the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the technological multimillionaire charisma that claims he can solve British computer problems: the sad Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odises of ridiculous falcaturades: costumed by comrades, they set fire to an ostensibly French restaurant; they create a riot that puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy by trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Obviously, all the arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way, it looks like it's pulled out of a children's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really justifies his talent?
The Labor Party denies that it is designing a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but covers five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five
The party wants entrepreneurs to pass the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to push the country towards workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported four days a week's changes as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
So and yet, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day work week does not come into the party's policy and is not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also imply that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on company councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector enterprises to employees, which embody annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy count "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, on the issue of an interview, the reporter of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unacceptable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett repeatedly denied it," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness about the real objective of the event of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (at least if you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as making a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success of Global Citizen at 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a june way of convincing people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism", people who think it marks the difference when signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, stimulating a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37,000 established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10,000 have already been disbursed or reclaimed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investment company that committed itself to "helping children develop up to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national authorities and the supporters of Global Citizen like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to the page of history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of infants and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on your website, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened to the great anti-apartheid movements and to the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to perform a "block" to make it difficult for Russia's energy exports, the US Interior Secretary announced
"If necessary," Washington may use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates in the instances of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia, saying that "there is only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a "cativo" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy can't be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, who met with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position reached Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency in 2020, said Senator de Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency during the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"On November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy to the presidency."
Warren felt about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course it's necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a poll by the Political Research Center at the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the old governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially before January, he informed the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the middle of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after taking a break in September
On Monday night, they arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with what is going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families that feel the consequences of the TPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are returning," explained the audience in a half of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans "are becoming different, hardened, wondering whether there is any reason why military and aviation companions, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District Challenges New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial appeal in relation to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who are victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18-state representatives and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant part of Grace's Pricing Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (USA) presented in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the US officials refused his asylum application on July 20th.
Detained Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The general prosecutor of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adapted according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The tax authorities continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who were victims of domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions declared in their policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day worldwide.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby in the city's evacuation centre in Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, collecting their belongings denied, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled her eyes as she explained how she felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor she shared with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of committing abuse with "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of going to the U.S. Congress, which will be held on November 6, as China denies.
Trump's accusation that Pequin was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country had in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witness to the level of oranges in their respective imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese compensatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Pequín had prejudiced workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Sunday of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying this campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the free U.S. press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the place of newspapers located at the end of this Pequín street, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the dispersal opinions that Chineses may have on China's worrying economic path, as the media are under the firm hold of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, even though he has not confirmed that the newspaper is a newspaper.
Kavanaugh's disaster has lost the female Republican vote to a few days of half-term elections
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various charges of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions surrounding these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse School on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn Progressist Group, in the Washington Journal, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the "Acercase November!" group, appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations," said a neutral political analyst, Stu Rothenberg.
"It's true that he's already tall,
but it will be even more so, especially among the indecisive polling women of the suburbs or those between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, a representative of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, of the final vote, or if Kavanaugh will sit in the prosecutor's bank or not, the problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support this latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the surveyed people believe in Ford's testimony in total or likely, compared to 35% that supports Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh was most likely lying during his witness, compared to 30% who thought the same thing about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of marriage when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he studied at Yale in the 80s.
World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data storage online or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company describes this as a "personal power through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its President John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would change their business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
The honour of Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victorian Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was won on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was given the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor at a show in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument 100 years after his grandfather's façade that deserved his title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann addressed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the game of an intense fire of machine guns".
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with a "great courage," directed the line forward before he rushed with a cannon and no one's help, and threw three people out of the enemy's show.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which headed the young Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt "I'm honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genius hero shows him the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the list to MMA's favorites at the best time
Imagine that you've been taking all night smart to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes, something's preventing you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 fights, being six main ones, and was streaming live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see the faces, the UK spectators were perplexing when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some did not get impressed after spending so many hours waiting to see the fight.
A fan described the change in these childish drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke."
"The state rule argues that this content was not appropriate for the 6th of the morning, and that is why it had to be changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when he was asked for the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take into account the UK spectators in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about the repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
I'm very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited from the first release of the Desert Island 4 Radio Discs led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low by illness.
As invited by the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" than the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
So he said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what moved me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the games of the Commonwealth of Australia to ask for more countries that would expose homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of the consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three times the world champion said to fall in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was all a surprise."
Daley married this winner of a Oscar last year and said that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who experienced similar exaltations.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son takes his father Robert's name, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was enter London in 2012, he wanted to be in the first line.
"I couldn't tell you that I wouldn't be here to take care of that first row," said Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that it was not really invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that it was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling" he said.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on his head.

A low-ranking Mickelson ended up in Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his technique so that it doesn't become an unfortunate event.
Mikkelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times to the United States, the five times the champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Even though it was never the most accurate of the players, nor even at the height of their career, at their 48 years does not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punishs the wrong shootings.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson was embroiled on Sunday's ninth party at the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good footing, Mikkelson's action could be absolutely crucial.
Fury trusted her husband, even though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a palm in my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Fury said.
"I had full confidence in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Fame Hall and has contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but eventually it's the way things are, and so we think they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halfs, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides the team with untenable.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a genius and he likes to be with people, he's a good guy to be on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good done to him by the younger players with him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in Ryder Cup's last individual day can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the target line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won little," Bjorn, in the photo, reflects, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players that are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual events, and there we have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a companion next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try your ability as a golfer as best you can.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your companion behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than with their companions, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who sum up three points of four.
The Furyk himself was in both two extremes of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending up as a loser during the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and putting the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship once again
The German Army's newest fracture should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not arrive at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The post of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, crashed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Armada commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class breakers.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful cannon, with different anti-era missiles and anti-bulbs, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to remove the newest fractures up to two years outside the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuous delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be old-fashioned when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was news last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss station in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Marina returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
He knew little about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical flaws in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the staff needed in the old Bremen class fractures.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the Rhineland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million is already reached, compared with the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest fractures are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that Marina is staying without ships fit to escape.
The officer says this problem is growing, as the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fractures could join the Navy.
National Trust spys the secret life of the bites
A new research that is being carried out in a branch of the Highlands in Scotland is going to reveal how the pieces use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pypistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the pieces during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis carried out by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the call of the pieces and that is being done by each species.
Next, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed image of the landscape scale of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Consultant, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to the bites and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to keep forests for pieces and other associated species.
The populations of pieces in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works affecting children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and alumina also pose a risk, as well as mosquito traps, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bites aren't blind,
But because of their night hunt habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the time of hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes very seriously the pieces.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasions, even rescues.
The organization has even the only and first reservation of pieces of Scotland in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of pieces of Scotland.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Treve we have a great area for pieces," he says.
"We have old buildings, historical trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we still don't know about the pieces, so the work we're doing here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of pieces before performing maintenance tasks in the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single child of maternity can kill up to 400 women and children, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, slaughter them, or trouble them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Preservation Trust official, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot left to learn about the pieces and, in the case of many species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo rejects the claims for rape and his lawyers are prepared to seek German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using his name.
Your lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus' predecessor was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, a US woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, touched this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," he said to the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know themselves by my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous for just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectful man," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they qualify as "an unacceptable statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would apply for compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her before, according to the documents presented at the Clark County Court District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was attached to saying that he was a 99% knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations agreed upon by both parties.
Mayorga also maintains that she came to the police and that she had photographs of the wounded, but later she came to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by the reprisals and worried about the public shield.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he incorporated the Italian giant Juve into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as world car manufacturer leader through Brexit, according to the business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK said in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to make an agreement," Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, responsible for manufacturing the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced around 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the subsidiary chain in the event of a failure to reach an agreement in Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is very adjusted, every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU car suppliers arrive at measure.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and pieces could be generated.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than a day on the Derbyshire plant, so the production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is "camped precisely to avoid border-frontier controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success, but also take the most of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent chains of Deputy Minister."
Toyota could not estimate how much time the production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, an employee of Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be nice again.
The White House said that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and Rosenstein's justice sub-secretary could be delayed a week later due to the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russian and Trump's assistants, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
As much as Trump fired the attached general prosecutor, as if he didn't, which would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about using a microphone to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through Amendment 25.
However, Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was late to avoid a shock at the Senate's judicial committee hearing that they testified to Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or a further week, given all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists have questioned that claim, since Sanders has been taking since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of an information session was not due to a reversal of the reporters' greatness, although he added that she would not be the one who denies that attitude.
You also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president" he said, even though he did not quote any source that would leak that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than to address the questions to her.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, and that's gonna replace a press round where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
However, press conferences in solitary confinement are few.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits in front of Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and communicating their wish to remain in the country through Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has undertaken to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of uncertainty for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows of the European Union and beyond bring an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Motors, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State trainer, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he was disappointed when he arrived at the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a trolley to do a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of red shirts, is in her first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This extra money will be used to help people who do not live on the basis of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will charge a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's campaign's success to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible living and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money collected will be used to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Feenda expects the change to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new constructions carried out in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a house for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spacious cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to apply for a cut in the tax on the transfer of land to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of the high vineyards by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderate-priced houses to fix the "governing of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing-related reforms, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of defamation in which the tenant is innocent.
He also wants to grant the councils greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of a house is too far, and the indignity that is supposed not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become the Scottish electorate at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-West Club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, at three points from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic states that he felt no concern about the fact that these figures were so consolidated in such a large club after rejecting previously proposed Barnsley and the Ipswich Town.
"Does success for me depend at this time if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly owned by a club in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to arrive, but it's probably just that you think I'm successful here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a trainer after a helping period in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the technical staff of the Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St. Mirren to be about to go down to win the championship title next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever found during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't feel bad, I made a reasonable profit of my life and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like to train.
I've always liked to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to one survey, the perfect time to take a paint is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday
The heat wave of summer increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 per cent during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA's trade consultant, who was responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The lower days and England's stay in the football world for longer than expected led to a pattern similar to that of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of the restaurants during June has worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results achieved with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars controlled drinking increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, employed by RSM analysis company of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in the context of outside consumption.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 per cent per annum will prove particularly painful if you add to that the constant increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the restoration businesses and the time will be responsible to say whether the moderateing of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the acceleration in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a total profit of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One of every five children has secret social networks that hide their parents.
One out of every five children (some of them only 11 years old) have secret social networks that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted by 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news has caused an increase in the fear of having sex content published
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One out of every five children (some of them only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a smooth "principal" account to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "violate her."
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the advice of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Federation's advice on athleticism as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most talented Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys an enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its inclusion in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot to do as an athlete spokesman, and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently working as a usual commentator for BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter, "I've had an apoplexy for a month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time could determine if I could recover and until I graduated.
It was a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing austerity exercises.
Thanks for the encouragement messages."
An advertisement of a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divided into public opinion on the networks
A milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an advertisement in which infants are compared to infants with cows that are mutilating.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first portable mother milk extractor in the world," Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to the babies.
Four real babies dance in a cow full of rage at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I've moved myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Because if you don't realize, they're not ears, they're my chests."
The chorus continues: "Muse, fly, I'm feeding the babies, fly, fly, I'm musing my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, provoked debate on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this shows the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and give light so they can produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving light," one wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly within a maternal subjecter (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor for babies who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the ad, even one woman said the song seemed "very funny."
"I feel like it's a great idea.
If you were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little fired, but it's interpreted as a joke.
I look like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed at babies who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "vacs".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be fit discreetly in a maternal subjecter, which gives women the freedom to move, submit their babies and even go out there while they're drawing their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism existing between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that involve while we demonstrated in a manner of entertainment and close to the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time Elvie extractor takes over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures shot at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign patrons to children.
Traditionally, most patriarchs were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential patrons and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenze, a senior officer of the U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked for minors without company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are patrons or who are part of their homes are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require any of them to appear in the trial before a month passed from their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through videoconference instead of in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not comply with the requirements for receiving assistance shall be promptly deported.
The longer they remain under custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent arrests or attempts to flee according to the refugee workers and system reports published over the past few months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo, where there is more possibility that the symptoms that a child is going wrong happen undetected because of his size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to give up friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also supports the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found in Syria alone illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in an appropriate manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from every foreign illegal presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great Idlib rebel base has allowed for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mouale stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would target the Shihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The UN envoy from Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
He explained the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and alerted against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second warrant
Following that logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-elect in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to their presidency in a premature manner.
In which it would no doubt be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, the primary-time audience indexes have multiplied by more than two, to reach the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled until reaching the 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights of important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor", who is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," he has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, he asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,' said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the others who appear on television, the plots that are arranged by Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if the immigrant families can come back together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it assumes something beyond being an informed citizen who spends six hours seeing a panel of experts discuss the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", the 15 000-dollar-dollar bomber of Paul Manafort's "a full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of the clever descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, High Executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and daily argumental turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching the MSNBC while he was recording the CNN.
He was unable to get out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these so crazy programs at that time, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The external money comes to many to fund the candidacys to the House for the election of half of the lexicure
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania Congressional District is receiving a large cash flow due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This district located in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, which was recently reorganized, is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is represented against another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is largely superior to the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was determined in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circumscription of the former districts for their benefit.
The election career in the new 17th Congressional District held a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after reaching a victory adapted to the special March elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalising El Salvador for its support of China and then dropped back
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and he even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order returning to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on visas, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in the mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three North American envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House decided to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations always and when the participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, from which there are currently plenty of evidence in the public file.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his research to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must report to that body, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable, as did his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the western front resists and supports the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We fail and lose the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that happened later.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or backward.
The U.S. is fraught with a number of these inflexibility points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenstein has been taking water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested writing secretly to the president and speculating that he was incapacitated.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information in The Times is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of the false charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the half-legislative elections for a Congress that requires responsibility for Mr Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my house as well, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to pick up Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans' player shows himself optimistic against the Rapid Vienna encounter.
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empate achieved in Spain in front of the Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favorable position to be classified in the G Group of the European League.
A knee injury prevented central champion Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 empathy in front of the Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the empathy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were higher.
The next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our public, I am sure that we will be able to fight to achieve a positive outcome.
Last year it was hard amongst all that happened to my injuries and changes in the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women care about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted them to take care of, few people talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their peers on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they'd talk to their children about it.
"People want you to take care of a family, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Insurance Department.
They can start next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't communicate your wishes with a lot of anticipation.
Work with your consultant and your family to wake up where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a determinant factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the funding options for extended care are a traditional extended care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or the self-security covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your father or mother has a medical emergency and she's on her way to the hospital.

A man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving for the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he received gunshots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred approximately at 02:30 (British Summer Time) as a "advantage act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Terretos e Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the communications cut, the rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area located in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided you with some key data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis occurred.
Dongala is a regency located over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This region, a region less than one province, had a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Centre of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 degrees magnitude struck south of Xava, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude was caused near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake affected the Mentawai islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's renaissance, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
On this occasion no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
Stop the eldest son of Sarah Palin for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, was arrested by Wasilla, Alaska, suspected of a domestic violence crime, to prevent the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretral Facility units with a loan of $500, according to KTUU.
He was brought before the judge on Saturday, in which he declared "not guilty, since then" when he was asked, he informed the chain.
Palin is charged with three minor A crimes, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently at the Alaska War veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and of possession of arms in Hebrew in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of poking a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
They count at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to increase in the course of the day.
The earthquake was just ahead of Central Celebes, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos through social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking to apply a few times the death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike ride from the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, following the life of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intendedly killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intendedly" injuries, according to the notification of the intention to apply for a death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both two offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, usually used by the tax authorities in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," said the prosecutors as they described the way Saipov carried out the assault, cruel and demeanor.
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the South District of New York did not process a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but finally the permanent chain was sentenced in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS that he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal law lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with a permanent chain without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team would ask the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to " feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that they should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Regular Mr Peter Bone stated in Birmingham's statement that the United Kingdom would "have already left" the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided lines of her party was evident when she joined the favourable Tories to remain in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of the Brexit, the opposition and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of the Left Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been contacted to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If you had been entrusted with this, we would already be outside the EU at this time," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must put an end to the Chequers plan'.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars for services.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that indicated that the public opinion would change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is completely false".
Brexit's storytelling and partying member Andrea Jenkyns has also been on the move since he told reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity between public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is impotent between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the concentration that it is necessary to ‘comfort’ the politicians if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a topic of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're gathered today to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who have given us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the parties to stay in the EU took a march through Birmingham before holding a concentration of two hours in the city centre.
A few activists ran out of banners with the Tories Against Brexit (Tories vs. Brexit) message after the group's release this weekend.
The laborer Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free frontier, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a locality in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his electors using the format of the council since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to solve the problems of our government, and for that to do, a woman is missing in the seat of the presidency."

Great prize for Russia: Lewis Hamilton reached the world title thanks to the team orders, which enabled him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since the time that Valteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who was leaving from the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only as he defended his position during the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run traffic on the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton went after several wheeled manoeuvres that caused Ferrari's driver to leave free of ill will the interior the risk of being delayed after a double defensive manoeuvre on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and rose to the seventh square at the end of the first round on his 21st anniversary day.
Then he led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get faster in the final part and ride Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally he entered boxing around 44 but could not move any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valteri did an excellent job all weekend and he was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
A poorly suited body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was charged with sexual abuse.
In a speech held in an act in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “miserable, repugnant and liar”.
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the Senate in the last days, when you see anger, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filterings and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I wasn't."
Are you kidding me?
Diane Feinstein, did you do any filtering?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Shall we filter it?...No.", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein commented to the committee, as reported The Hill.
"I asked you to keep your confidentiality and do what you asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the act of Saturday night: "I tell you that the body language was not the right one.
He may not be filtered, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who's hurt, they have to lie down to recover power and control," said President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie went to the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard came to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the time for the men of Adam Keefe, who managed to get up to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was produced at 3:35 a minute thanks to Kendall McFaul's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an aggravated initial period, Sullivan re-entered the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants moved in the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard recaptured the game with a goal through power play in minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen join Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory through the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at Milton Keynes' next match, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers from an airplane can escape a earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to make sure that an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely be fired.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people trapped under the shells of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which was violently balanced.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the exit track at that time, could be safely fired.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could allow hundreds of lives to be saved, informed Australia's ABC News channel.
We've prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Rom down our hearts when we are buried," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is created that can continue to increase because there are many bodies under the helmets and many of them could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman said.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and survivors.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are getting the minimums out."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after a plane accident in a lake
The aircraft that operates a flight that exploded in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person who previously claimed that the 47 passengers and crew would leave without incidents the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The aircraft reported that it was working together with the authorities, the hospitals and the local investigators to try to locate this man.
The aircraft did not immediately respond to more detailed requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk's airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The aircraft reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the aircraft and the United States Army confirmed that the plane landed on the lake before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane went off the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little time.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Army reported that some sailors who were working close to the site in the best jobs of a pier also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sinks about 30 metres.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst consists of night chronology in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution returned to the evidence on Saturday in the repetition of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompensate the moves of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting Chambers at night of his death, contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went to the street on Saturday and testified that that day was not found in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"The Boron of your life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge expressed that he hoped that the judge would be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has filled its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its origins with political messages and combating social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a redundancy in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York Children's Guardian asks a couple after a "racist" message.
A New York Children's Caregiver will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from her mother who complained she was "another black."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish when she discovered that the guardian of Giselle Maurice's children was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the guardian who had just gone, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her the day of work and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to demand the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and requires a $350 compensation per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract on average.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he told Post on Friday, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism claiming that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after she offended her.
"My wife would send you a message that she had no intention of sending.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they have offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are they going for a person like that?
That's not very ethical," the investment bank added.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and the logical application.
Paddington editors were afraid that readers would not be identified with a speaking bear if they could end up in a new card
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who worked as a camera for BBC before being inspired to write the children's book on a small playmate, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "welcome" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing imagined," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think I felt the success of Paddington a little like that.
Although it was a creation of his own and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and had to fire me through the phone
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to fire her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart running late were slowly consuming and leaving her body.
She died a while ago, and now she's turning off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at that moment of struggle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noting the calvary she was suffering.
"No one detected it," he said.
"I had my head down and I fell down with tears all the time.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of distressed women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are taking cards to a galley bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to whom you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression, and she committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile was in any room."
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that a side effect is produced."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can come and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day touched the bottom (when the children opened their agasalls, he made no visual contact with them or anything).
He said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He broke up the family.
He set us up.
But we have to keep moving forward and fight."
If you feel like going forward, you can call the Samaritans for free through the number 116 123 (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) to send an e-mail to i@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future lies in a thread as the FBI launches research
"I thought, if we could get something like what I was asking (a research for a limited time and a limited range), we might get a bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "blowing" because of the paralyzing of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathies want the FBI to investigate?
Its reticence is due to a matter of time.
If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to the who, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently employ 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the knot and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea low under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea reader.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea Union Ministry, said that 1,127 deserts occurred during the last year, far from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the rates charged by people to cross the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them went through China, which has the largest third border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone that exists between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continues in war) has improved significantly over the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This was produced after the historic June meeting between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-an celebrated in Singapore, where they agreed to work a great deal to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we do not trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and assured him that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted that way, she would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement against the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was shown to be very excited, at times almost shouting and talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats, cataloging the accusations against him as a "agreed and coordinated murder" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think that he dequalifies himself with those statements and with the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection to the patient and the care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In the context of the confirmation, Kavanaugh failed to raise questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical person to access the court and still on top of it to say, look at that well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diather, months and years of rage floating, and it can't expel it without crying.
"When we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're best thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then I continued.
I think it's brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for the anger in part because essentially they are not understood.
One of my most neat memories in one of my first works in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a taller one that always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the corner of the stairs.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they agree with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an adventure outside of marriage in a boat called Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," I said among the songs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone named it "Brancaneves and the seven pines."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't get in the race for the presidency unless he was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported him contributed $1,000 to male candidates only $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (by gratitude to the people who supported him, by frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and to address voters instead of delegates and by anger for existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my blade?

How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were co-ordinating and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning early this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was produced this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Pequin countered each time in the same way, the latest rising rates from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to surrender to his demands, but publicly obliged to the United States would be much more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia's Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the conditions necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are in place.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries that support the rise.
Europe achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final marker of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, which was the most battle he ever offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who got a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was installed in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5&4 by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first ranking in the world's ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight quarrelsome Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American golf legend Tiger Woods for 2&1 on Sunday's individual match.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up playing that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, a 14-size winner, just behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had trouble getting out of the streets all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
For a moment this morning, Europeans were in trouble.
We fight.
I take the hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior."
