In my view, the literature programme was formed by women of the Balzak age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danish and the Volconian.
They were writing a billet, of course, in terms of the same women of Balzak's age.

Germany: Fourth injection of coronavirus inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with the new force.
Despite an active campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of coronary virus vaccine will likely be sufficient for full protection.
In this, the head of the Association of Doctors is convinced of the common practice of Ulrich Weyheldt.
On Saturday, 11 December, Die Welt reports.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required by summer, at the latest by autumn," the expert said.
Furthermore, Wiegeldt hopes that the fourth kronavirus vaccination will be possible “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the crown virus, Omicron.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of reinfection of Omicron three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
The results of the preliminary study carried out in the UAR have shown this.
As a result, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that the two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of Omicron.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine is significantly below: “the neutralising potential is reduced more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that the two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide adequate protection against micron-stamp contamination," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zalzberger, advocated a reduction in the interval between the second and third appointments.
More than Zalzberger believes, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing," the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
Bet-A-Vib series is a special Bet-A family brand from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other outbreaks because it was originally used for fertilized fish, not only for fish, but also for fish.
These outbreaks are greater than those near to the likes, which certainly has a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting spices.
Another feature known is the upper ceiling of solid and hard plastic, which creates additional vibration deviations in vertical and horizontal circuits.
As a "winter vibe" in the capture of Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchable is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement by the driver up-down almost without a pause.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very large that it is comfortable to catch in a limited area, which is damaged by underwater vegetation, by roots and other obstacles for which a trap is possible.
In addition, there is a slight deviation from the winter catch and the big hawk, especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive baiting is required.
When reaching the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is immediately turned on and returned to the baseline.
At least Bet-A-Vib has been successfully used for winter hunting of the pear.
You can choose from two modifications: with or without NS-NanoSound (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to disarm a passive loop that does not even react to live.
In fishing, the Bet-A-Vib has demonstrated its distance and accuracy.
This roller is understood and not capricene, it is well combined with the leather and plaited snouts even with large diameters.
For hunting, the turtles, the turtles, the eagles or the turtles are not evenly relevant and the steppe, sometimes with the "knock" on the bottom.
If you're hunting in a cornered area, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of the traps.
Among the beneficiaries of its Bet-A-Vib class, among the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with the same success in both relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All the models are equipped with the owner ST-36.

7 thousand Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
There are more than 7,000 employees of the private military company (CHC) "Vagner" in Libya.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the High Council of State of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri said that.
"There are currently more than 7,000 Vagner C.C. mercenaries in Libya."
They also have planes.
They also have transits in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at the Gardabia Airport (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), " says Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries were "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "they will bring their own person to power" in the Central African Republic.
_Other Organiser
In the view of the publisher, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “replaced in Libya”.
"Vagner" has been in Libya since 2019, uses the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the aviation base in Jufre, is listed in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially denied that the Wagner CWC was supported by Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, the personal protection of leaders and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of valuable and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to those countries," the article said.
According to the media, "wagonists" were allegedly fighting in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not significant in the force departments or in the juridical register, and its fighters are not on the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
I recall earlier that 27 EU countries had approved restrictions on Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the Euro Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the transfer of a single vote on the election of Members of Parliament and Heads of State since 24 December at least on February 2022.
"The election remains less than two weeks, and the chances that they will be reduced rapidly," is noted in the material.
In this regard, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has deferred the final list of candidates for an indefinite period of time, the Sky News Arabia telechannel.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent believe they have failed.
"Measures of success - "protected in Syria, restored peace there", "Decision on the North Stream-2", "the whole world feared that a great weapon," "The Krem we have repented."
The main failures are conflict with Ukraine, confrontation with the Western countries, isolation from peace, and a study of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Dubai Government has completely rejected paper production - all services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paper production and the transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the WAM emirate information agency.
"Today, the beginning of the new phase of the digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life -- we have completed the transition to a completely unarmed government," said the successor Prince of Emirates, President of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Mactum on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation will now be conducted in all Dubai facilities only digitally through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, CCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to the electronic Government and the digitization of the document has begun in Dubai since 2018.
At the time, according to the authorities, 336 million letters were saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Former Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobianin stated that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November in the light of the fall of the pound.
As a result of the 11-month industry performance, Bloomberg reported on the data of the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the Association, 115,000 vehicles were released in November, 20 per cent less than a year ago.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars have been exported, with more than 25 per cent of them entering the previous year.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey's car sector has shown a positive trend to last year, the vehicle issue was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year's.
The decline was due to a sharp decrease in the Turkish pound rate, which in November was 29 per cent relative to the dollar.
This has led to economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 ICB actors received a delay in credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, told about the situation of providing a facility for small and medium-sized businesses, a correspondent from the MIA Kasinform.
“On the information provided by the Agency for the Management and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, pursuant to the mandate of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency adopted the order of 9 April 2021 No. 127 “On the approval of the deferral of payments for small and medium-sized enterprises”, Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to a motion for a motion.
He recalled that the arrangement for deferral of loan payments provided for the provision by banks and microfinance organizations of deferrals granted to ISS entities before 1 April 2021, including IP, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was 30 to 90 days for the selection of an ICB.
The claimant's claim may indicate a different time limit for payment.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-claiming work was suspended, the notice of the need to settle arrears, as well as the taking over of commissions and other payments by the creditor," the imprimer said.
In 2021, second-level banks received late payments from 603 ISS borrowing entities, of which 553 ISS entities received late payments of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the IFO, applications were made at a delay of 131 ISBs, of which 95 were granted to an amount of 105.8 million Tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the strain of "aquiron"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can carry it easier than those with a strong immune response
The pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strains of the coronavirus "amicron" could be dangerous.
There's a reason to be looking for a virus.
Scientists believe that ometron has been born into a body infected with HIV or with immunodeficiency.
I mean, in the mutation, he didn't face any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
I see he's got these spic-whites, the spikes, maybe more than he has, their antibodies didn't cut during mutations, says pulmonologist Sergey Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity can carry ometrons more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, isn't always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens when a 30-year-old dies of pneumococcal infections, and the 60-year-olds carry it.
The immune response of a young man, he is totally inadequate: where he could only be threatened by a finger, he beats like a gun on his cheeks, Sergei Purassev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case only symptoms can be bought - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will begin to intoxicate the body, which is temperature, weakness, inability.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat first, cough.
Pain on the right or the left, abdominal pain can also prove a developmental problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year, the growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated.
The virologist, head of the IFTI gene engineering laboratory, said that this category was very active in kovad.
For adolescents who attend school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
It is the most socially active barrier, as did child garden educators, "Moscow 24" said, Paul Wolckov, a virologist, head of the IFTI genetic engineering laboratory.
I am most grateful to the author for this article.
It was a pleasure to refresh the memories...

Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity become victims of cholera
The authors studied the fat tissue left from bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adiposes could be infected with coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue were also infected with macrophages, with a strong inflammatory reaction.
The researchers also studied the fat tissue of patients who died of cholera and found particles of coronary virus in the liver surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in the liver using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
That's probably what SARS-CoV-2 is capable of.
The biologist explained the causes of the dementation
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Golosheykin described the causes of dementia and described how it was prevention in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome appears to be a gradual loss of cognitive functions - in time, a person with difficulty is even oriented in a known environment.
Golsheikin noted that the most common cause of dementia is neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the conduct level, the role of social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementation also affects harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder, and low - moving lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of its risk factors," added the biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of WHO disease, it is recommended to maintain the required level of fish load, train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.

Egypt has returned about 30,000 unlawfully expelled from the country of artefacts
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to the family about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally expelled from the country by contraband.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returning Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, announced this in the air of the Al-Hayat Tele canal.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to return 29 300 artifacts.
Only this year in the Bible Museum in Washington was found 5300 memories of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Howard explained that all counterfeits were registered in the archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “following worldwide auctions and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored after the return and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was found in Belgium an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find an auctioned Pharaoh Tutanhaman's brush in London.
Christie's auction house on July 4 held a auction where the bus was sold for $5.97 million over three thousand years (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art was illegally removed from the Carnaval Temple in the 1970s in Luxor.
The head of Tutanhaman, represented by the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and was not on the market since 1985.
How the religion has fallen into Europe, not known.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally exported from the country at a time of ancient memories.
According to the authorities, 95% of the anti-trafficking ages are the result of the archaeological discovery of black miners.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (22,000) are the independent people (near Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.
Crimean tattoos are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, says the Financial Times.
The case is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications to its staff, instead offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under the applicable rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its staff, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check the mobile devices in extreme cases, for example if the staff member has used it to meet a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote work regime, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to address work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline to which staff can meet the new rule.
The information on the new requirement is officially not commented on in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Essenina's life, 1925, was fruitful in the plan of creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "hego".
He's already out of any literary associations, he's drifting around with the immaterialism, he's himself, but he's known, he's been torn apart, he's been a bit of a bad critic, even bad, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
More than 60 poems were written a year, many of them are the present masterpieces, complete the "Persid Mots" cycle, written by the poem "Anna Snegina", published by 8 books, the collection "Russian Soviet".
The main success was at the end of June 25th, when Gossedad concluded a treaty with Esena to publish its compositions in the 3rd volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrrovich poets have been so honored, he's the first!
In addition, this resulted in very good money - a fee of 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubles per month, engineer - 200).
The funds were needed that year as never before.
Esenin married Liv Tolsto Sofie Tolsto's granddaughter, and she had to set up a family home, hold sisters Katu and Sash, as well as mother.
Life would have seemed to be something to be happy, but for him everything was decorated mainly in dark shades, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published already after Essenina's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is that the wind glowing?
(They will be) in plain plains and in plain plains.
It's like spring in September.
The brain's drinking.
Many well - known people have noted that Essenin has given up very hard, it looks bad, it seems to be sick.
More and more convulsions, nerve collapses are repeated.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexanderovich has been told, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, in May 1923, when Essenin urged the fourth woman, American Aisedora Duncan, to perform health care at a clinic in Paris with Professor Petr Gannuškin (he will again fall to Essenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's arrests, the scandals on this ground, the police's charges are distributed to dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin moved for a short time to a friend named Ivan Starzeva.
Amazingly, though, Esena had never had her home in Moscow or in Peter when he had very poor income, either in private homes, in hotels, or in acquaintances.
The old man remembers:
"There was only one night, and in most cases in an unlucky, drunk state.
One day, coming back at four o'clock in the morning, Essenin fell on the stairs...
Falla, he scratched his face and his throat.
With a little in it, he began to cough constantly, rubbing all the simple blood..."
Yes, even Essenin himself after the war on Europe and in the United States (then there was a dry law, but Duncan accepted a considerable supply of alcohol):
"I didn't see anything there except the cabs and the streets...
I've been through and I've stopped remembering...
Well, and the drink, of course...
And I was drinking because the dot was in danger."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Orient Due Latex Econom is a modern implementation of the budget model in a premium line.
The base of the matrix is the block of the independent double spring Duet.
Inside the large spring is a softer spring of small size.
This allows the distribution of the burden on the mattress evenly.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and strength of this material increases the comfort of the matrix.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it's not moisture and dust.
Matras will make a big difference in weight (about 20 pounds [30 kg]).
The smart spring doesn't have the effect of the wave when a light partner falls on the side of a heavy one.

Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms" against the EU
MIDI Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms"
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to such "operation" next year.
The relevant statement of the Mid-Mid lock was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to the Jablonski, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lucashenko", but it "takes an active look for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As the website kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It was attended by 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country is not improved”.
In response, the Ministry imposed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by a Shadow hat": when a bartender's cock makes a man laugh
In the light of the 2021 activities, the peacocks were dominated.
Please, the first person to state his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Still in September, he appeared in a barhattian pjacka and a traditional "bando" granny.
After his example twice, Prince William, who first awarded The Earthshot Prize for the King's Dress Code, followed a green barber's pyjak and then selected a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity charity.
A few weeks ago, the trend was similar to that of Lionel Messier.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in the bartender's Pizza Dolce & Gabbana.
His sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for men's pajamas in Russia.
According to the service analysts who went to Gazeta.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular hot bartender pizzards with a silhouette and a silhouette, the main colors are dark-dried, ship-dried, dark-silver and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubu, and men prefer to buy exclusively pajacs, they choose to pick the cut suits.
You can buy them not only for online dealers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The luxury pizza from the bar in this season is presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the model Gucci, in which he went to one of the prime ministers of the "Dom Gucci" ambassador of the Jared Leto brand.
By choosing the pickling of expensive marquee, you can be sure that the bar is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of the cross-section, a flat fabric is obtained with an external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of a boy or a polyamide, but are therefore less served.
Modern expert Lamoda Ilya Wahoškin warns that in the case of a bartender, the main thing is not his model or pheasant, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires the evening light, so such a pizza is ideal if you've gathered for a party or a Christmas event," explains Wahoškin. "He'll come in for the occasion if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is included in the invitation.
Another important criterion that allows the choice to be made in favour of a bartender is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the bartender's pajamas, first of all, should be aware of the right stuffed tusk with enough, - the authors of the telegram-canal about the man's fashion "Krasavczyk Brammel." - The owners of the bartender's pajamas usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to adjourned light activities, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilia Wahoškin offers to combine a pizzak from a bar with the same items: classic brooms with arrows, one-toned skirts, shelves, loffers with axes, straps.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Modern experts from Brammel's Crassowček are convinced that there will also be an inappropriate appearance in the barricade of a number of corporate employees, and that is, if it is a "director of those who manage this event, "yes", he has such a thing on the subject."
If the rank is below, and its purpose is to move higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to cut off financial bonuses, it is best not to expect a barricade.
The guide accurately evaluates this with the phrase "not by the Shadow hat", - they consider the telegram-channel editors to be a man's fashion.

Immunologist stated that four to five months of revaccination would help protect against the strain of micron
Revaccination within four to five months can protect from a new strain of coronary infection, micron.
Such a statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Krüczkov, who called the trip six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a very large period of time”
"In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure five months later, and people with chronic diseases are four," said the expert, calling for revaccination in parallel with the campaign.
Kručkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good titre of neutralising antibodies.
"If a person has done two exercises and a booster, or he has been infected and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has been infected, he has been given "hybrid immunity," that is, an antidote that is much and neutralizing enough," said the expert.
"The Great Seven" warned Russia of the "great impact" in the event of an invasion into Ukraine
The largest seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the mid-term meeting in Liverpool.
It stresses that the "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "is going to have a huge impact and the price of killing" in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement states.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations on transparency of military activities”, as President Baiden of the United States spoke during a video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the normative form of achieving the full implementation of the Mining Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine," said Foreign Ministers of the Great Seven.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have a huge impact and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the position held by Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier that day, the head of the British diplomacy Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be "serious" in the event of an invasion in Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “one voice of the largest seven countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than micron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain coronavirus 32 times below the rest of the disease.
The University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong, South China Morning Post (SCMP), concluded.
The vaccine was considered to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity among citizens receiving two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people have had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against micron diversity," said Professor Malik Paris.
However, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the serious flow of the disease in the case of coronary infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine forecast the development of the kronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on micron-stemma.
The researchers concluded that micron-stum could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality unless additional measures were taken.
Ukraine's mine defense head accused the GFR of blocking NATO weapons supply in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former Frog Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of Kiev's deadly weapon within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany had put a veto on Ukraine's counter-suppression systems and instigations to defeat the unmanned.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position with regard to gunshots, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to pursue the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the allies.
This is particularly true of the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Shollz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev was not worth waiting for Berlin to deliver weapons to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous FWG leadership explained its refusal to provide arms at the risk of the development of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "non-legislative" position, a certain diplomat, will be maintained by Germany in the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in the possession of the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to be "a technical partner of Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of the year, the Co-Chairman of the Green Party of the FRG Robert Habek visited the Republic where he was selling defence weapons to Kiev.

"Mersedes" believes that the rules "Formula-1" 48.12. and 48.8.

G7 warned Russia about the responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G7 warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the party ' s statement.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," says a statement published on the UK Government website.
Ministers of the G7 and the EU High Representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed strength and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The Head of the Media of the United Kingdom Elizabeth Trass warned of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the increase in Russian troops at the border with Ukraine, the parties had to return to the negotiating table.
This was about the "Norman format" negotiations.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for dialogue on Ukraine in Normandy.
The representative of MIDI Russia, Maria Zaharova, said that, after calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries were “inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Discovered ways to return stolen via the online money store
There are several ways to return money stolen from the Internet store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by the information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses in falling bank card data into the hands of criminals, it is recommended that basic funds be stored on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the stock may be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate map for online purchases.
If money has been stolen in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure can be initiated.
"In the framework of the rules established by payment systems, under unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility lies with the party in a series of calculations that do not use the service," explained the representative of Promsvezbanka.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to lodge a complaint with the bank not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that did not require two factorial authorization, the transaction could be reversed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases the Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Court, Director of the League of the Safe Internet, Ekaterin Mizulin, reported that in 2021 only 11,000 cases of fraud had been dealt with: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under current circumstances could be the establishment of a single window for complaints to online brokers.
Shollz arrived in Poland to discuss the North Stream-2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor Olaf Scholtz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Scholtz had stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of two countries expressed unmistakable expectations of one another.
Polish Prime Minister Mateus Moravezkiy said he would call on the Sholtza to speak against the North Stream-2, on which Russian gas is expected to be delivered to Germany in the course of Ukraine.
In Moravecco's view, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland ' s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court of Justice has exacerbated Poland, finding that judicial reforms by the right party "Right and Justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which has sworn in the middle, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of an invasion of Russia into Ukraine.
The US officials told Congress members that they had come to an understanding with Germany on the suspension of the gas pipeline if Russia entered Ukraine, a high-ranking official of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these messages, but Shollz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border and confirmed that position on Sunday by the representatives of the "Larger Seven".

Mincís wants to give the writers residences

The money left in the church wall will pay $200,000.
The Santechnik, who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the prize.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the Great Evangelizer of Lakewood, where the pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that God - fearing Christians are waiting for riches and prosperity.
In November 2021, Santecnik Justin Kouli repaired one of the church’s toilets and found thousands of packages of money and waiting.
He handed over the church’s discovery and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could do," quote his KPRC TV.
In all, finding is linked to a theft that took place in Lakewood church seven years ago.
At that time, some $20,000 was lost in cash and $40,000 in the form of cheques stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer loss.
However, information about the offenders was announced a $25,000 prize.
Justin Kouli could not claim that amount, as the award deadline had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time awarding $50,000 and later receiving $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, has decided to reward the honesty of the Santecnik.
He'll get $200,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police had questioned the pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.

The list of exceptions also includes persons from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been demonstrated.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for the New Year’s, Precarnival and Carnival dinners, as well as other activities, which entail an increase in the turpentine”, said Barroso.
In the past, Brazilian authorities have forced unaccompanied tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme from COVID-19 has been opened
Virusologist, doctor of medical science, who deserved to be a scientist in Russia, Anatolius Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a comprehensive scheme of protection against coronary infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nascent vaccine.
In international use, immunoglobulin A is produced in large numbers. This does not occur when injecting the vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And within the vaccine, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antithele).
And if you enter both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's still no solution for a double vaccine," the doctor said.
The main prophylaxis of UrFO, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using the nasal vaccination together with the injection was the possibility of stopping being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body was likely to be maximum.
Former Minister of Health David Melik-Guseinov stated that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
He said that such a picture was seen in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics had taken place earlier.
Other, um...
I've been talking to a horse (death long ago) - if you're ready to change the warm house, the feed, the love, the love and the games on the liquid bitch, the front.
But the dog was trained, and they were smart at all.
He chose my society and went home.
In a video mode that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken so long, believe me.
I stopped many of the owners from running after the dog, even though they thought that the van, 200 thousand running (pomsky), took the hand and led the other way.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose a host, not a dog that ran somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination in Europe do not end
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators went out on the street.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination compulsory.
Since February the following year, unaccompanied people will have to pay a fine of EUR 3600.
The Spaniards, upset by the health policies of the authorities, took a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some people held a poster with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, copper-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, homes of old and night entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports has been taken by a number of regions of the country in view of the increase in the number of cases of coronary infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestors protested against the strengthening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it grew into conflict with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators has turned stones into police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied watertights.

WHO has found micron in six tens of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of micron has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have disastrous consequences.
The rate of distribution of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization on 9 December, 63 countries have already been identified in all six WHO regions.
It was that it had become active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of distribution of the new coronavirus.
WHO experts are afraid that a new strain on preliminary data may be affected by the spread of delta strains, the same Indian version of coronavirus, which is now leading to absolutely no exception in all countries.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreyez, stated that micron-shamm could have a significant impact on the development of the coronary pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also come to Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the micron will pull out the delta in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone is about 1 million. This is because, officially, “micronum” is currently suffering from a number of hundreds of people in the Kingdom, and according to estimated data, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How the micron reacts to the Russian "Sportnik V" is not yet known - it will become understandable within the next few weeks.
The Hamalei Centre has only begun testing the Russian vaccine on the micron strain.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraud
Swindlers began looking for new ways to cheat on video messages.
That's what we're talking about with the experts.
According to the Director of Products of Ividion Zaura Abutalimov, the main risk associated with the distribution of video communications is dipheiki.
In this case, fake videos are produced by fraud on the basis of real records involving the victim.
This neuropathy makes it possible to reflect the particular behavior of a person.
Abutalim added that using dipfeek, the offenders may call the famous videotape victim or create a role with a human copy to be sent for blackmail.
"This kind of subcontracting can easily lead to Bulling, because a counterfeited criminal can put people into unfriendly, dangerous or compromising pseudo-sensitories," said the expert.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Aleksandr Vetcol, in turn, noted that psychological people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technology.

Diabetes can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive activities play a key role in preventing disease development.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - lowering the number of various drinks and switching to normal water have a positive effect on metabolism.

Not only is there an improper diet but it also affects habits.
In order to reduce the risk of diabetes, a lot of movement is required.
Specialists recommend maintaining low-carbon diet.
Such treatment will not only help to reduce weight but also protect against sharp sugar fluctuations.

Because of the deterioration of self-esteem after work, it is often an “external migration”, a well-known endocrinologist, a medical scientist, a senior scientific officer of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the ICU, a scientist at the Zuhra Paulova System Medicine Clinic in his telegram channel.
In her view, it is especially common for laborers who experience major pain, breakdown, and weakness in the outputs.
Dr. Paula noted that, in addition to the week of fatigue, there are enough objective causes of the body’s negative reaction to change conditions.
Our life's out of the way, it's going to change radically.

Researchers in the UAR reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
In the UAR, Pfizer vaccine has been reported to be low against “micron”
Researchers in the South African Republic conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against the micron strain of coronary infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of “micron”) corresponds to (the level) the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, and therefore... is suspected of the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, experts have explained that the medicine can save from the serious flow of the disease.
In the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, previously predicted that the micron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much secret sugar in ordinary products?
Sahar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its survival may lead to second-type diabetes, as well as heart-consistency and oncology.
Users should take into account that under the unknown word the product may contain a hidden sugar ingredient, a similar sucrose by calorie, composition and glycaemic index.
A number of dozens of names can be presented on the label, in fact marking sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other raw sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from maize), leucose (fruit sugar), melase (black stream), syrup agawa, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that relate to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in a doctoral flask, bread, etc.
According to Russia, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targeted and unprocessed products, as well as to focus on the label and many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugars vary according to taste, but whatever the ingredient is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact quantity of sugar, as not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package but also that the plants, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total number of sugars may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas loses importance for FRG after 25 years
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said that gas imports were losing its importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards the decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany was planning to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
"This is 25 years from now, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to FRG and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to remain committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which support for the energy transformation of Ukraine was recorded by Berlin.
A former head of IDI Germany, Annalna Berbock, stated that the process of gas pipeline certification "Northern stream - 2 " is continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is "not in compliance with the requirements" of the Euro Union.

The hackers broke the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
The hackers broke the Twitter account of Prime Minister of India Narendry Modi.
Prominents have been able to publish a fictitious message.
It was reported that India had probably recognized the bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that the country had already purchased the cryptovalut.
In Modi's office, they asked for new messages to be ignored.
The prime minister said that they had responded quickly on Twitter - they had restored access to the account.
India's prime minister's site had already broken up in 2020 and called for contributions to the fund through the encryption.
At the New Caledonia referendum, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same outcome as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against their territory during the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was much lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51% (2755) of those who voted, while 96.49% (75 762) voted against.
The apple was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonian people taking part in the elections.
According to France-Presse, “the outcome of these elections did not leave any room for doubt,” as independenceists urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they objected to it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago would prevent a full and “honor” pre-election campaign.
Thus, the non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the French New Caledonian supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3 per cent.
As separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and dispute them in the UN.
As reported in the Sunday, December 12, in the Elisa Court, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, should take the lead in this referendum.
The theme of the independence of New Caledonia has survived in many of the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates in the presidents expressed the benefit of keeping the territory in France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemmore repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republic of Valerie Pekress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the election of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article on Russian and U.S. relations
The Wall Street Journal criticised Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russian and U.S. relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was likely to bring Ukraine to Russia's victim.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger that came from Moscow and allowed a number of offensive statements to be made to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell, Western countries were calling for “one front against Russia”.
The WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of American professor.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands area
An earthquake of 5.2 took place near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
Ochag lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Seismologists have previously recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing reactive pilots of a new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start creating an ANKA-like reactive pilotless aircraft (BPLA).
On 11 December, the outgoing adviser to the head of the Office of the Ukrainian President, Alexie Arestovic, reported on this.
That is, they are capable of acting against aircraft, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against a pilot's flight.
They will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft: a corpus and so on," he quoted Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of ANKA equipment, Arestovic said that it was a reaction rather than a blasphemous BPLA.
He said it was a new generation of unmanned after Bayraktar who exceeded it “in all characteristics”.
The first BPLA party should be produced by a factory at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a non-pilot was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Ukraine's headquarters has recently secreted data on the use of Bayraktar non-pilots and Javelin missile facilities during military operations by the United Nations forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, announced that the country had begun the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military unmanned aircraft.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use the drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mine-defence concluded an agreement on the construction in the Kyiv area of the Centre to train staff, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BLA Bayraktar.
The Office of the Ukrainian Leader's Press Service called this memorandum "a great real step forward".
Two liones escaped at the airport from the container
The lioness escaped at the Singapore airport.
That's what The Straits Times reports.
Two predators were able to get out of a container with a family of lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the runaway lions fell on the roof of the container.
The animals could not escape from it because of a number of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival of the Mandai Wildlife Group staff at the airport, all of Singapore ' s zoos.
They have removed the lions with the help of drugs with a transquilizer and are planning to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the host and wandered on the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and people did not suffer.
Specialists warned about the risk of vitamin B9
Studies show that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express was warned about this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less at risk of some types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, a higher dose than required contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Bet Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it significantly deviates from this figure to a large or smaller extent.
Kitcin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor’s recommendation, should be followed by dosing and should be avoided with milk and other food products containing follicle acid.
A former nutrition consultant, Rachel Fain, called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocado, Fain recommended that men have this fruit over 50 years of age.
In Britain, about 75,000 people can die from micron storms by April.
British scientists' forecasts show that because of the spread of micron-stamp coronavirus in the next five months, up to 75,000 people could die in England unless there were more restrictive winter measures.
The Guardian reported this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TAS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations at the British Office of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand summer outputs from the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
In addition, more than 2,000 people will be hospitalized every day at the hospital's disease point.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent overload of the National Health Service if micron strains become more contagious than the delta option, and the existing vaccines will not be able to eliminate infections," said Mathematician Rosen Barnard of LSHTM.
The UK Health Safety Agency had previously informed that if the rate of micron-tham is maintained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be identified by the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in Britain, 1898 cases of micron-stimma coronavirus infection have been detected, of which 633 were detected in the last few days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that this figure could actually reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some smart comment, but she read it before:
"The noise resulting from the incredible suffering of an unlucky animal and its work for the second job."
And it fell on the table!
I guess "unlucky animal" is a man, and I thought I was snooping!

The demand for superheroes grew worldwide by four
Construction is superfluous this year, and orders for the next year are all recorded in the world, despite the calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register, the number of yachts ordered was 1200 units, 4 more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for floating strength will not decrease by 50 million pounds and above, says the Guardian.
But they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25 per cent of the courts were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say there was no 20-year-old travel on the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of soil infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If all these people had previously gone to the office and met with business partners in person, the absolute majority of them now work far away, and the negotiations are in vain.
Broker Will Kristy told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the buyers are willing to pay more, only if their yachts were ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in time of deprivation of travel to space, the life on the yachts or the flights on their own aircraft is a source of disunity in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose that new taxes and rules be introduced for the super-rich, although they also understand that in such a mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
However, only the number of superheroes ordered impresses them, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds the REV Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
After landing it'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a moon pool, as well as a submarine designed to explore sea depths.
In the existing super yachts, helicopters, movie theaters in the open sky, and in some of them, such as McGregor's yachts, have become a platform for uniforms.A professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint produced by super-richs is insignificant.
But it's symbolic if you realize that the multibillionaires in the world hear more than 2,000 people.
This is just another example of overusing a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions of billionaires are thousands of times more of the world's average statistics.
If one man produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest contaminant of the planet is Roman Abramovic, responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
The two-thirds of the emission trail was anchored on its Eclipse yacht, 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner has no yachts, the team continues to poison the planet.
The master may call the captain and command the boat to be driven, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea in the Caribbean.
The superheroes do not express the sympathy of others when they, like the most wealthy woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant courts have no place to start.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a 50 - foot - long [50 m] sailboat.
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of cough cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer development.
That's what Daily Express says.
Specialists have concluded that the use of four and more portions of alcohol per week is associated with an increased risk of oncology development.
In this way, the likelihood of disease development is increased by an increase in the amount of alcohol used.
More than that, moderately drinking men are at risk of breast cancer than women.
The precise reason for the development of such a type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to harm to the body of the process.

Dogs can understand the words and phrases of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely, all dog lovers are convinced that these creations are very clever.
But they don't even know how many fourths are actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to make sure that they know how to develop animal intelligence.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
Scientists' efforts were announced in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make lyrics, they don't mean anything in politics, economics and art, but they often get their hosts to sharpen.
The representatives of some tribes, they consider experts, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are still insufficient.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, for example, labadores.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of thinking logically, and that they do not give birth to a two-year-old.

In Ukraine, prepared for the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will be "trading" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kotchenkov said in his article "Glavov".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are soon planning to continue negotiations on United States guarantees that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right to “enter” countries.
If you are asked to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, for example, you will not be trading, but simply send the offeror.
And for Ukraine, there is a trade," the analyst wrote.
Kotkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, and not until the group is discovered and deployed by the opposition forces,” he noted.
China encourages the development of the rail transport sector
China ' s leading technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to the 2021 China International Exhibition of Traffic Transport and Equipment, held in the city of Zjužou Province of Hunan /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. automatically enable the train to detect and diagnose technical deficiencies, the representative of Hou Zjawenh noted.
The high-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which had been put into service at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with these technologies to ensure greater reliability and mobility.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased the exports of rail vehicles, and many countries of Asia and Europe are witnessing China's speed.
In May this year, with the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-wheeled power-driven vehicles designed for export to Europe were combined in China.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometres during the train, these trains will run along the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the metro train developed by the company mentioned above for Turkey began.
The train will be operated by the metropolis, which connects Istanbul to the city's airport.
The metro movement will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest-level industries in innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fen Yaosan, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CSRMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of the production of high-class Chinese equipment on the world market," said Fen Yaosan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, in a number of independent research and development, China has established a better rail equipment production system, with a complete support set and with large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaosen, the country takes the first place on the electricity level of railways and on the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementation
The candidate for biological sciences Semen Golosheykin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementation could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, plan, lower abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of its risk factors, said the expert.
He stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the main brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors today do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to initiate its prevention in a timely manner.
He said that reducing the risk of developing dementia would help to study foreign languages and actively communicate.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intense memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular exercise of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbys that require intense memory and logic of thought,” Golosheykin said.
A former charity for the study of dementia in Britain stated that disease is increasingly affecting people over 40 years of age.
The doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a problem with vision, which causes the patient to gain complexity in the identification of objects.
Another sign of developing weakness was the fact that a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to treatment abroad
Former Georgia's President, Michael Saakashvili, needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told neurologist Otar Toidé, who is part of the Council of Doctors established by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, change in character," said the specialist, noting that this is not a normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-energy rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidé, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotaging medical care after the prison staff had been subjected to his disciplinary punishment.
Georgia's policy has quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to the former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have been made in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were passed by the European Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID passport became mandatory for bars, restaurants, sports, homes of old and night entertainment institutions.
Many of the manifests have come to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, the vaccination passport will also be required for entry into leisure facilities and will be restored to capacity of more than 50 people.
The protests in this city were declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronary infection have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic, with more than 88,000 patients dying.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated persons.
The draft legislation on a single QR code system was introduced by the Government in Gosdom on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to visit places of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food facilities and retail trade, either with a certificate of refuge or with a transfer of disease or with a watertight from the vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

How the Chinese become miners
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international courts in the country
China hopes that not only will the Olympics attract 300 million people to winter sports activities, which will enable President Si Xinpin to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also facilitate the economic development of the remote provinces.
The mountain resort in Zjanzjakou, near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening work is also being carried out: the workers are cutting down trees.
There are over 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough for international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are available, including in Zhanzjakou, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for the long-term is to provide a comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all new arrivals can become permanent.
But it's still far from that.
The adviser to the Igor Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese fake industry has changed to ignorance.
Every year, the winter on the slopes is getting more and more Chinese.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it would take many more years to create a mountain culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop and create the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chongley, not far from the winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a speedy railway from Beijing to Sholley was carried out, and now none of the locals suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are being opened.
The shelters are opened with a national kitchen kitchen.
There's even a COVID-19 test station in Taiwan.
China is seeking to create a flourishing winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty due to the pandemic of coronavirus, which has hampered mankind’s progress in universal access to health services, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Services of 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They found that the pandemic had led to a failure in the delivery of medics, causing excessive stress in health systems.
For the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population was reduced by immunization, increased mortality from tuberculosis and malaria.
In WHO and BB, the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation affects more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their caravans.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish said that the crown virus pandemic had brought more than 100 million people to poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister for Democracy Debate on a White House Request
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tan, on the panel discussion during the United States-organized "Samita for Democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, showing the record of the summit on YouTube.
The Reuters Agency, referring to sources, claims that the picture was unlocked at the request of the White House.
According to them, it was the reason why Taiwan was given a separate colour from the PRC that considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world to the extent of civil rights.
Taiwan has been designated as "free" as green, and the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Viet Nam are red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a box with a note that the views of the discussion participants were “not necessarily expressing the position of the United States Government”.
The CD was not invited to the "Sammit for Democracy".
The Reuters sources point out that the map shown by the Taiwanese Minister could be contrary to the policy of one China, which is maintained by Washington.
One of the Agency ' s sources stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council was angry with the Department of State, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The “Sammit for Democracy” organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December, with representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia has not been invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, the editor-in-chief of the “New Journal” called for the creation of an international fund through which money gained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Subbeza RF Yury Averianov stated that the summit would be “an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

China enhances the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where landfills are located
A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the CDR Board of State has been issued by a circular that prescribes the strengthening of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where landfills are located, in order to further prevent the spread of infection from abroad.

Those who arrive in a city where landfills are located must submit at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will apply from the date on which the relevant provincial administrative units define and publish the areas of the cities mentioned, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with landfills that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Mid-Mid, they described the "poor conclusion" between Russia and the United States
The chapters of the Media Department of Russia Sergei Ribkov in the "Experience" interview evaluated the prospects for the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to disastrous conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one side of negative predictability, and this is a part of some prospect of improving relations completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have both passed with the current administration and with Trampo and with Obama.
Problems didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Fibque, the problem is that the United States is seeking to impose a number of approaches on Russia.
MIDI's chapters added that there would be no risk of optimistic prospects for better relations and no change in Washington's position.
He explained that progress had not been made except in areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
However, Russia calls upon the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of a sound mind.
Former Head of Media Russia Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States at a meeting with US Secretary Anthony Blinken.
The virologist warned about the risk of vaccination with a nascent medicinal product from COVID outside the hospital
Allergics may occur and require medical attention, so the first points to receive this medicinal product should not be organised at airports and malls.
This was reported by the TACS virusologist, a member of the RAN correspondent, by the bioananotechnology, microbiology and virology of the University of Novosibir, Sergei Netesov.
It would be easier to organize Nazi vaccinations at airports and shopping centres, but I would only do so at first glances in medical institutions.
The case is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small but desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office.
The doctor has a special set of antiallergic drugs that operate literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the opinion of the virologist, it is possible to think about vaccination at the malls when experience is gained in the use of the product.
He also stressed that the use of the nasal vaccine was important for her to fall on the mucous membrane.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if it is swallowed after pressing.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine
Sputnik V vaccine is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, the TAS Minister of Innovation and Technological Development Nenad Popovic.
"The Torlak State Institute has so far produced about 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, and we expect them to be produced at least 4 million in the coming period," said Popovic.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is used by Serbs most popular.
In this regard, the Republic plans to make an additional purchase of a million doses of vaccine in Russia.
The Minister for Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia has also expressed interest in the production of Sputnik V and Sputnik Light in the territory of the Nasal State.

In the United Kingdom, 1239 cases of micron-stamp coronavirus were reported - RT in Russian
In the days of Britain, 1239 cases of infection were identified with a new micron strain of coronavirus.
That's what Sky News reports.
In particular, 1196 new cases of micron strain have been reported in England, 38 people have been infected with new infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new UK strain reached 3137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the Pessimistic Prediction estimated that in England, as a result of the outbreak of the coronary virus caused by the micron strain, 75,000 people could die.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that introduced anti-rossional sanctions
The Press Secretary, President Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued " aggressive action" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "integration" on the territory of the country.
"There are restrictions against Russia and no suffering on its own," said the official representative of Kremlin at the Russian television station.
Peskov claims it's "understanding everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of introducing anthropogenic sanctions in the field of energy as a final measure.
In addition, Washington and the Euro Union are planning to impose restrictions that will make it difficult to convert rubles into dollars for the Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
But Sberbank's head, German Graff, is sure it's impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television station BFM.TV reported.
Against independence, 96.5% of those voted.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting level on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the archipelago were present.
According to experts, the low incidence is due to the separatists ' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of coronavirus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia opposed independence from France in the referendum.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the population supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20 thousand miles [20,000 km] from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are approximately 270 thousand people living in the archipelago, and the territory is given special administrative and territorial status.
Between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration, the 1998 agreement provides that the region can hold a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO considers micron to be less dangerous than delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) is of the view that micron is less dangerous than coronavirus delta.
However, there are data on the reduction of vaccine effectiveness in the new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, micron was registered in 63 countries.
“Preparation data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the micron strain allow for a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
The preliminary findings from the YUAR suggest that it (the "weight of the disease" - row.) may be less severe than the "delta" - says the WHO Technical Communication.
The Organization notes that as long as all recorded cases of micron infection in the EU flow easily or inadvertently.
However, the new strains, according to preliminary data, are being distributed more rapidly.
Two cases of micron-stamp infection have been reported in Russia.
They “were previously immunized,” the Gamalai Center reported.
Anna Popova, head of the Rosusztsur, said that there is no reliable data yet that the new coronavirus option is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Green
The High Council's Ex-Deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukraine's President, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain without the support of the West, as well as possibly compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko told us in publications on the Glavj portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“The price reduction for the key goods that we traditionally export <...> domestic protests and the opposition of the authorities to the key FPGs (financial and industrial groups) is being reduced. - Order " , added the ex-Parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will occur in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
As a result of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go to Donbass compromises, which may result in domestic resistance.
At the end of the summer, the Green position will be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former backdrop, is up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is to oppose the Green Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the control of the force block and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During such a crisis, the Greens will begin “reforming the government”, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the conversion of the Greens to "the father of the nation."
This could lead to a event that would be a major shock to society.
"The compound must be large enough to respond to external partners and increase Ukraine's support," said Denisenko.
Such a development option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an aggressive action by Russia, the ex-Deputy.
However, the Russian side has not once denied any likelihood of an attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from the Socialist Group Rating showed that the Ukrainian President's rating fell to a record of low values, accounting for 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of his head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the next election of the President of Ukraine, a total of 21.8 per cent would vote in favour of the Greens, compared with the former President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of all the support sought was expressed to the President.

"To quote Eutushenko for 10 days, that's it, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Wolchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student in the U.S.A. was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #exhaustively large.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugania Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the recurrence of public action was prepared in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Puškina Square, at a meeting in support of Alexei Navowal.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now to its interest, unfortunately lost, to the fall of the common culture in Russia, and to inspire as little strangers to write their texts on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We have contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to discover more details of his message.
How did police officers address you in custody this time and before?
What was asked in the department about commenting on your action?
At this time, staff were more correct, detention was as important as it was not funny in some context of that word.
In Puskin, they took the OMONovs and took them hard.
They asked the standard, about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked at it as though it weren't acceptable, it was understandable.
Except for all four sides of the fence, it was all right, but I knew what it was.
And if after the action under this hashtag they start writing their texts, even if a few people, I don't know what I'm doing these 10 days.
For the most part, the protocol allows you to speak at least in the language of the Tumba-jumba tribe.
Public and official activities speak the surrounding language to make everyone understand what happened in Budapest on 25 September 2001 or in the native language through the translator.
This is a protocol, and nothing more, namely, Angela Merkel speaks Russianly, but he does come to the aid of the translator.
The official activities are also carried out with an old-fashioned autograph, and the verbatim is not required to know a few languages.

Researchers have explained how potatoes help to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The cornfruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fish flavin, folate and pantoenic acid.
All of these elements help to operate the system of the body.
The potato also helps to combat age violations.
Thanks to the high content of the cell, it is useful for the iron and oxygen tract and can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the most part, the cornfruit is better dried or cooked than burned on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycaemic rate.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are rapidly spread to sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Commission warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction of its production in private sub-sectors and the increase in processing capacity.
In the view of market participants, the product deficit at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Andex" edition.
Candidates for flight
In 2015, RAEC/Media's legal owners made a list of 100 major pirate sites of the runet, and most of them ceased to exist, said the Director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazarian.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search edition of both "Andexa" and Google, you can see the pirate copies of Netflix's "Play in Calmar" and "Sensitivity" series by the director Anna Melikan, the original series of the largest video service in Russia.
In Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine, you can see the Encanto animation news, but, judging by the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (recorded in a movie theater, a pirate copy of the movie).
Filmix, which can also be found through searches, is available in the "Universal. 10 years later" TNT TV series (as part of the "Gasprom-media").

Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ulmite.
The model is comfortable with having two different soft surfaces – high fat and hearing more average.
Only quality and premium supplements are included in the product, which have been recommended exclusively for the best.
Springs: In the center of the model, a block of independent “micropacket” springs is established.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that work entirely autonomously.
It is their operation that provides a unique precise setting.
Micropacket is the most frequent of all the diversity of the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillers: top and bottom of spring combinations are established from the string layer and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plate.
If one surface has a latex, the other is a coconut.
Such a filling tandem has long been classic, since it transmits not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the anchor provides the right back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
Chocolate: The model is placed in a simple triangular glass Aloe Vera.
The customer wants to make it both supple and stable.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus for the search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported in the “Current Camera” on Sunday.
The five-year mission's goal is to assess the suitability of Venus clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, are too acidic to be able to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a kind of planet Earth.
During the third mission, a sample must come from Venus.
Let's assume that if we find life there, it's going to be a major question, whether it's like earth, or whether it's different.
If so, it would be obvious that life on earth did not begin.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said Estonian team leader Venus Life Finder Michael Pausalu.

Metallurgical Change in Russian Business
The theme of meta- age has become a popular autumn of this year, when Mark Sugarberg announced the conversion of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the biggest game has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
Thus, business in Russia, as around the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta- age and subsequent monasteries.
The target population is to be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a tendency to create remote interactions in the pandemic, because people have become disillusioned and restricted.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of asset digitization, when any rights, valuable papers, art production and even money are converted into a digital format.

British economist could not predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not predict 2022, since he believed such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be a wave of unpredictableness and any trend can change traffic.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronavirus, and secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether to increase the price of goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already survived" and that it is time to return to relations where inflation rates will be adjusted at the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, in the light of the pandemic, the continuation of over-the-counter economic policies could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new outbreak of inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as poverty growth and climate change, O'Neill said.
The previous head of Global Investment Research Division, Michael Schulgin, reported that positive expectations for the 2022 dollar course remained, and growth potential would be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Sulgin called FRS monetary policy, oil price dynamics and fear of the background of the coronary pandemic.
It was decided to do so.

Russians gave about 4.5 per cent of their GDP to car dealers
As a result of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on new cars, 28 per cent more than in the same period last year, the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) statistics show.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State in support of citizens and the economy during the kronavirus pandemic.
Last September, President Vladimir Putin of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization said that this amount would be more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) for 2020.
Russian market revenues are leading the Korean brand Kia.
In 10 months this year, he was able to deliver 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year ago.
Hyundai's family Kia brand is still more than 35 per cent growing, and the sales price is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average price of the car - in Hyundai's year it has grown by almost 21 per cent, up to 1.94 million rubles - was the strongest travel dynamic only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the volume of sales to Korean brands has not increased significantly: according to the Statistics Committee of Autoproducers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4% more than a year earlier, in the quantitative expression of Kia.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
It shuts down three sales leaders in Toyota's currency, which spent 275.5 billion rubles on the Russian car in 10 months, 14 per cent more than a year ago.
The Japanese followed the Mercedes-Benz index of 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - with the German brand premium increased and sales volume (37 per cent) and the average car price ( almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also saw a good growth in sales and medium-sized prices -- more, for example, than BMW -- from here and greater growth in financial savings -- explained the Director-General of NAPI Tatian Arabadi.
At the rate of growth in sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also increased considerably this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth shows medium-term indicators (plus 28 per cent), with 229,4 billion rubles being spent on this Russian brand in 10 months.
Last year there were companies whose machinery was sold in 2021: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
In less than 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on extraterrestrials and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
In view of the problems with the supply of autocomponents and distortions in the production of the entire world highway, the auto companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same AutoWAZ increased the value of the Lada seven times a year, the last journey (from 8 to 10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices are regularly rewritten for their production and other autoproducers.
The volume of Russia ' s car market in monetary terms will be increased further, in addition to the lack of machinery, it is an inflationary contribution, as well as the desire for auto-concerns to lose their past losses, experts believe.
In the circumstances of the lack of cars, I think that many cars have even partially been able to transfer the cost to the consumer of past periods that they could not put at the price of cars before,
"VTB Capital" analyst says on Vladimir Bespalov's motorway.
I believe that in the financial context, autoproducers are now feeling very well, supporting the high margin of sales."
The indirect indicator is the rate of growth in the value of cars observed during 2021, the prices for new cars are rising faster, the expert explains.
In the long term, markets will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespal predicts.
Increased opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In a monetary statement, the Russian authority will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the value of the cars will slow down, auto producers will be able to obtain their income from the volume, notes an independent consultant on the Sergei Burgazliev motorway.
In view of the high demand and lack of supply, car manufacturers are now striving to obtain the highest profit from each car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in the production of machinery is not expected at least in the next half of the year, and in Russia, there is still an increase in the uncertainty of future citizens.
In the light of the market situation, cars have become a poor object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with the passing of time, you can now sell the goods of real value, the expert notes.
Byden spoke of the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The US leadership has never considered sending US soldiers to Ukraine in the case of an invasion of Russia.
That statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Byden.
"There were never such plans," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Byden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not in the agenda.
Byiden explained that if Russia enters the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flag, B9 - all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Baiden said.
Former Russian President Dmitry Peskov's Press Secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem of the military use of drones by Kiev by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
