"MG Baltic" case: the new Gustany lawyer says he has not yet been able to get to know the file
All the defendants, Sharūnas Gustanis, Gentaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligius Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis, were gathered at the 11th session of the MG Baltic case on Monday.
The trial session began with evidence from the defendants.
At the previous court meeting, the new attorney of St. Gustavios, Alexander Dorošev, told the Chamber of Judges that he had not yet been able to get to know the subject of the case.
At that time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevičius stated that, in order to ensure the full protection of the individual, the judicial board must allow the new lawyer to know the substance of the case and asked to withdraw the hearing.
"In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must be aware of the criminal matter.
It is not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevicius.
The new lawyer, Mr Dorošev, noted that he was unable to get to know either the criminal act or the entire case.
Earlier in the previous trial session, the suspect, Mr Gustainis, informed his lawyer of his refusal because he could not pay him any more.
The meeting also had audio recordings.
The prosecutors feel that the audio recordings submitted to the court are of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that, by taking advantage of MG Baltic, the policy has supported or initiated decisions favourable to the group in the Seim and other state institutions, as well as affecting public procurement winners, ELTA recalls.
More than 150 persons, more than 50 of whom have been members of the Seimas and of this term of office, have been interviewed during the trial.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 krats have been conducted.
S. Gustainis is believed to have received more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros.
The Working Party is suspected of counterfeiting and trading, the Liberal movement - counterfeiting, trading and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of dumping and trading of these parties.
It is suspected that the policy on the harvest was addressed to MG Baltic Vice-President Kurlianski, and subsequently, Seim or other institutions proposed or supported the Group's positive initiatives.
Ethical Care: The Liberal Consciousness Board on the Rights of the Vilnius Division
"The decisions taken by the government are in conformity with the laws," - following the Commission's meeting, the BNS, its head, Vytautas Tamosiún, reported.
"Our decision was not something new.
An explanation as a commission has already been made in July, when the issue of Fame and Uten has been raised.
Then we said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of the government's competence.
And if the board decides that any section may act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees with it, then the section may go, but if the board decides that there will be a party list, which the board and which it has adopted, then it is a decision that all sections will form a party list.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamosiuno, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Consensus Board of the Party rejected the decision of the Vilnius City Section to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the Management Board of the Party, the decision of the municipal liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the Party, the decisions of the Board.
By 31 October, Vilnius had to withdraw its efforts to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the department didn't do it.
The former head of the section, MP Aušrišnė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Consistency.
Vilnius Mayor, former President of the Liberal Consciousness Remigius Šimašius, who was promising to pursue another post of mayor of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Social Election Committee "To Vilnius, which is to be magnified!"
He also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
On Monday, officials reported a tiger, which had previously destroyed one man, to the rural tractor in northern India.
The forest supervisor Mahajira Kaujlagi (Mahajira Kaujlagis) said that she was caught by a tractor while trying to break up by a man working in the fields shortly after Sunday.
People say that this tiger also attacked and robbed a young man about 10 days ago.
The small village is located in the district of Lakhympur, about 250 km south of Utar Pradesh State, in the district of Laknau.
It shall be prohibited to retain a tiger in protected areas.
Director Ramesh Pandey (Ramesh Pandius) said that under the Law on the Protection of Wild Nature, the case would be reported to the police.
In April, in the Nighasano region of the state of Utar Pradesh, the villagers destroyed another tiger, which suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Law on the Protection of Wild Nature, tigers are considered to be a endangered species.
Last year's government data show that in the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day during the encounter with wild tigers or drums.
Human conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection programme that established bans in national parks and the end of major cats has begun to be considered a crime.
Although tiger calculation methods have changed, the census shows that the population of approximately 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed cats and dogs must be labelled with microschemistry
The Chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the Seimas Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law proposing that cats and dogs should be marked with sub-species.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with sub-systems and that they be registered and labelled by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with public funds, and in 2020, cats will also be involved, so the public will not care and costs will be covered by the specific state funding provided for," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of the Seimas.
The amendment of the Law aims to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the micro-schema and service to be around EUR 5 per transitional period, all pet owners will be compensated.
The total price of the labelling of all animals may be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
The funding for labelling programmes is expected to be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenue this year due to the increased redeployment of natural resources taxes and funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeika, the practice of compulsory labelling has spread in almost all countries of the European Union, it also allows for the protection of the animals themselves (without being easily returned to the owners) and saves the time of the farmers themselves when the search for the fugitive and the deceased has to spend a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides for travel to be possible only with marked crops.
At the same time, marking requires responsible care for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals were compulsoryly marked by opposition, as the relevant programmes were proposed to finance the population's funds.
"Now the model of this criticism should be avoided, because animal protection is proposed to finance the increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinary doctors but also citizens, i.e. persons with animal welfare institutions, who have heard special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing the Seimas groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenius Gentvils, Edmunds Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Lithuania is one of the best countries in the world with business traditions, so we will be truly honored here.
We hope that we will receive support from the whales.

At the tournaments, astrologers will be able to arrive free on Wednesday, and the start of the double is 19 hours.
"The women lie better" star actor B. Arsobaite is being falsely persecuted
This is most likely only a coincidence, but the bright red actor Brigita Arsobaitė is once again given the role of the liars.
At first the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagais".
In this film, Brigita plays a prominent Danish hero wife.
"I really liked filming in Melagi, because I'm more of a theater actor and I've been in movies rarely.
A wonderful team of colleagues was gathered from the very beginning to play a great result.
This experience is very important to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the floor was Sunny's dog!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never had those little, decorative fifs fours.
But during Sunny's filming, it was so close to me that the sympathy became mutual, and finally I even hired her to buy it from the mistress, but failed," she said.
In the comics and intriguing peripecies of family members since the first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai" has been produced by Lithuanian hits "Untested" and "In addition to our boys..." producer Paul Virbick and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Rasarionovas.
Your lover just reported - she's waiting.
It would be a great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't publish "good news", your parents will make an unexpected statement - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening even before the most beautiful of the year's festivals - St. Christmas!
But the end will be even more amazing, because no one believed in such atoms.
All the heroes are not what they looked like from the first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaite comedy "Melagai" a good atmosphere for viewers four times a movie star: Giedrius Savickas, Danius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedratiytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Gardvanis.

Whether to write 100 million euros of unpaid taxes
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Registration of Living Place prepared by the leader of the "States" of Ramúno Karbausski.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour of - 9, and 25 abstained.
Then, on or after 6 December, the Seimas will consider the amendments, following the conclusions of the Government.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years, one person does not pay about EUR 1 thousand, and now there are about 100 thousand of such persons.
Social Democrats Algirdas Syss regretted that in this way, Seimas would "invite people not to respect obligations" - to declare departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Conservator Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that by paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania to treat - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax to the residents.
The amendments provide that the persons who have left Lithuania will be considered to have paid social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will be released from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of the "Sodros" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of migrating people and the activities of "Sodros".
An online video recording about a hearing forest reveals a serious problem
It is fused as a mother’s cell is glued to a flat layer, and a small one is glued to the ground, and a copy of it is made again.
The video received many reviews and comments.
People were dreaming of the reincarnation of the little boy - not once on the floor, he snuck back to his mother.
It does not happen for the first time, but the little one does not have to give up and finally achieve his goal.
The image is truly focused, but it also reveals the danger that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm clear that the arched drone was very provocative.
From their movements, they can see that they're panicking.
If the environment did not damage the drone, they would probably have chosen a safer path or had it hit slower or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," Ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues were studying how the drones operate.
Heart rate was adjusted for animals.
When the drones approached one another, the others did not escape, but all their hearts began to cry more often.
Scientists recommend that drones be filmed for responsible use, avoid close contact, avoid noise and do not interfere with where prohibited.
You asked the fledgling president for a newspaper.
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the outgoing President Viktor Janukovykis, who left Russia, to come to the trial for his alleged state extradition meeting in an unusual way - a call was issued in the State's official publication.
In a call from the court, published in the Government's Knowledge Journal, Uridadov Kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a meeting of the criminal process on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates that Mr Janukovyčius has the right to attend the meeting with a video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev court issued a final debate in the Janukovyči case.
Mr Janukovyči's lawyer in Russia was given the opportunity to register a foreign lawyer in the register before 19 November, so that he could attend a meeting where Mr Janukovyči was expected to have his last word in the video.
The Kremliaus supported Janukovyčius was transferred and fled to Russia during the Mayan uprising in summer 2014, which provoked the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been transferred to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
That year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine, and as soon as the country's war broke out between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, some 10,000 lives have been lost, despite the efforts of many international communities to ensure long-term benefits.
List of preservatives to the Vilnius City Council
The former Minister of Agriculture, Mr Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
In the weekend, during the first election of conservators, members of the party rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
As reported by the party, the chairman of the TS-LKD meeting in Vilnius was V. Benkunskas.
In the first ten candidates were the members of the Vilnius City Council, Paule Kuzmickienė, Adam Buzinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audius Beautifuls, Rasa Baskienė, former member of the Seimas Lituras Kazlavickas, President of the Youth Conservatories League, Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karasiaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration forces to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to the ruling of the Governors to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Group of the Opposition Group of the Father-Lithuania Christian Democrats (TS-LCD) reported that the group of members of the Seimas appealed to the KT, requesting to examine the compatibility of amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the managers to the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the existing projects of waste incineration plants, calling on the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the law enters into force in Vilnius and Kaunas to build waste incineration plants", says the report.
"Parliaments note that, given the nature of the prohibition on the construction of State-owned waste management objects (i.e. the distance and the definition of the concept of "resident territory"), it is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out economic activities related to the production of waste energy, because the established criteria are to be formulated in such a way that, in the assessment of the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, the construction of such objects is practically impossible in the territory of the country," they add.
We claim that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The Court has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and effects that have occurred before the new act has been adopted.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law back in accordance with an indefinite criterion.
If such a regulation is to violate the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, so also the constitutional principle of the rule of law," we shall refer to it.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the cogenerational power projects of Vilnius and Kaunas.
In the absence of projects currently under way, the State would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, large losses, and Lithuanians would increase the price of heating, as a result of increased environmental pollution in waste disposal.
The members of the Seimas TS-LCD, the Liberal Consensus, the Socialist Group and the former head of the Socialist Group, Algirdas Butkevičius, signed an address to the KT.
A few weeks ago, Seimas was able to gather 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalios Grybauskaitė, which provided for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogenerational power plants already started, as well as 20 km from the area of residential "carantino" to build such power plants.
The amendments to the law adopted by Seimas will enter into force as from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend projects already started is not planned.
The KT will record the order of the order of the case - not earlier than one year later.
Released LeBron's statistics at Lakers Club
The start of LeBron James' career at Los Angeles Lakers Club is not as much as he hoped he himself, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers season began with four victories and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create hunger due to the possible release of Coach Luke Walton.
However, only such languages were comforted by President Magica Johnson, who said he would not let the coach go, but he needed to play better.
The greatest star of the team, L. James, should return to himself.
Although the brake statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 recharged ball and 7.7 results transmission.
But she didn't tell the whole truth.
During the first ten season matches, other numbers also show that Lakers is playing better when there is no L. James on the site.
A +/- statistics show how much more points are inserted or missed by a team when there are certain players on the site.
That's when L. James is on the ground, Lakers spends 30 points more than the competitors in this season.
He had 19 points worth more than the competitors.
Currently, the "Lakers" Western Conference is on top of the 13th place, but a few victories can turn everything up in high feet.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuania's airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister Linkevicius.
Spanish military forces have already carried out NATO air police and air police strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish 'Eurofighter' destroyers were deployed in Šiaulia this year in May-August.
Spain will also contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that there is regular consultation between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communications in the fight against propaganda.
L. Linkevicius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented her letters to the President, Dalais Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienje on the detention of R. Ačo: I believe in man's incompetence and legal protection
"I was the most incredible thing that I could never think of.
On the other hand, the ministry is likely to carry out the work that must be done.
We each do our job.
I believe in law, I believe my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action should be taken by him," BNS said V. Achienė.
R. Ača Special Investigations Service (STT) detained on Monday - the law enforcement suspect that he was still a director of the administration of the Razeja municipality and that the exchange could create exceptional conditions for the private company, which signed a contract with the city-run Razenia bus park.
The representatives of private companies are suspected of having a direct paper of R. Ač or of having a participation in masking coughs in various financial operations.
The Council of the Municipality of Rasei district, R. Ača, this year's three-year trial, following the lack of confidence, was dismissed from the duties of the Head of Administration.
The former "order" of this year became a newly established Gedimin Kirkilo, a member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, and he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
A few years ago, he unsuccessfully nominated as a representative of the Election Committee "Your Raceini".
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy at the Raseinos mero elections next year, but has not yet been decided whether or not to participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė is a member of the Commission of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
Politicians say that they are waiting for further legislative action - it will depend on whether it will be removed from the work commission.
"I really don't make decisions today, this week, I think, I'll decide.
I'll see if there's a need to make any accusations, I'll make a decision, or something else.
It must be necessary for me to remain separate from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - it will put everything in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives, Seim Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėniė, invited Seimas President Viktor Princkie and the leader of the "states" to withdraw from the statements of the group of colleagues in Vidos Ačienė and withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, moving to another Seimas committee or commission.
It says that further work by V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to public-based mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Now Coldplay is a world-wide famous, respected and popular group of seven albums that have been sold over 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy.

West Bank shot Israeli gun-fighted Palestinians
The battles "stopped the way for this attack because they identified a terrorist who tried to hit the civilian and IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) soldier," says an Israeli army report on the incident at the Kirajat Arbos headquarters near Hebron.
"Karys set fire to a terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
The Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers did not hurt," the report added.

Such attacks have been reduced in recent years, but it is alarmed that new waves may arise.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot, and a group of Jewish soldiers were attacked near Hebron.
Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment by European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
In the opening of the trade and investment forum for China in Shanghai, Grybauskaitė stressed that, in the light of the signs of economic slowdown, the common objective of Europe and China should be to "couple efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world" based on the root causes of trade-war tensions, over-production and unfair competition.
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign business is expected and safe here, as well as by strengthening intellectual property protection," said Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investments must be "higher than any business group's interests".
"Districtness, rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential part of the new investment relations environment," said Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt flows of capital should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition tries to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
Several Heads of State, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions, including Lithuania, participate in the exhibition.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently holds 25th place among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to more than EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can bring an adverse political influence, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe is hindering EU unity.
Dissatisfaction: mobile signature service is already in operation

The reason for the crash of the Lion Air aircraft: the nearby influx of the fish
Data from the blue box of Lion Air, which is located at Lion Air, shows that over the last four flights of the company, there has been a failure of the speed meter, and the researchers reported on Monday.
The president of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSC) said that a similar approach occurred during the last four flights, including a decisive time when on 29 October, the otherman crashed in the Java Sea immediately after his departure from Jakarta.
All 189 people were killed during this disaster.
A lot of media has reported on the fraud during the previous flight Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said S. Tajjono during the press conference.
"The data in the Jewish box showed that over two flights before the trip Denpasar-Jjakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"In social networks, there are a lot of rumors.
We now want to explain that in the black box (supply data) there were four flights in which there were problems with air speed measurement," the head of the NTSC said.
During the meeting with the members of the family of the deceased, Mr Tjajjon said that the information of the flight recording equipment was consistent with the reports that after the aircraft increased the speed of the last flight and the height had changed irregularly.
Search teams have not yet generated a second black box recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
"Lion Air" indicated that the technical failure of the flight from Bali to Jakarta was corrected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to order a meeting with the officials of the moderated members of the family, overseeing the search for aircraft and victims and a disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kushnan in 1999, be joined by Lion Air.
"Lion Air has acted improperly," said one man, admitted as a passenger Shandy Johann Ramadan, a working prosecutor on the island on which the plane is flying, father.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never met me since the start of the crisis.
We're missing our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any feelings."
After this meeting, R. Kirana quickly left, avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families look forward to the long-term results of the process of recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts have been transferred to nearly 140 lavender parts of loaded people's support.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The natives asked why two months ago the pilot was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on October 28th, including following the sudden crash of the passenger on the ground immediately after the take-off.
"Lion Air" said this mistake was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - He asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The law was very clear, they did not say that the plane had been allowed to rise again.
These bad techniques must be answered in accordance with the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr. Tajion said that a large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris is landing in quite a small area indicates that the shipper was likely to burst into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it crashed into the sea.
He didn't blow up the air, and the aircraft's engines, when he hit the water, acted with a lot of coatings - it shows all of the broken turbines' minds," - an explanation officer.
Lion Air is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when the Garuda aircraft was hit by 234 people in the vicinity of Medano.
After the accident, rescuers led the rescuers: injured and uninvited
On Monday evening on the road Vėžaiti - Plungė, there were cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" in Tilviki.
The cars were hit by a bomb, reported about three people who were injured.
It is reported that BMW's driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road and was cut to the Mercedes-Benz car, who was born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firemen from the wreckage - the rescuers.
You're a girl from Mercedes-Benz who's been through the crash with the data.
All the victims have to go to the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need for artificial incentives for referendums
After the Seimas approved the proposal to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the president, the veto, says its advisor, Mindaugas Lingė.
"For the Constitution, more than half of the population voted - that is the requirement.
This change, in particular the articles in its first section , should certainly be at least a majority .
It's not hard to predict that the president is really vetted," the manager of the Dalia Grybauskaitė told her on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defined the State's basic matters - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, and therefore, by reducing the number of votes necessary for these articles, Mr Lingues would have created "a negative precedent" and "an unmanaged risk".
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need for artificial relief, there is a need to prepare for the referendum itself, there is a need for more dialogue with people," he believed.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides for the adoption of amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with a higher protection, provided that at least two fifths of the citizens who have the right to vote are accepted during the referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote may be replaced by articles of the first and fourteenth section of the Constitution.
The right to vote in Lithuania has approximately 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths are millions of voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas approved the President's veto on September on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which reduced the requirements for the number of votes in favour of the change of nationality as defined in Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
It is proposed to reduce the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are scheduled.
Emigrants cannot have dual citizenship on 11 March 1990, with the exception of some exceptions.
The dual-citizen community of Lithuanians is seeking, but fear that, under the present conditions, referendums will not take place - not enough people will come to vote.
R. Masuulis: Lithuanian airports are "barška", so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to collapse, so it is necessary to update it, says Minister of Communications Rokas Masuulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already fragile because it was planned for lower passenger flows.
We must update Vilnius Airport - it does not even belong to remote planning, it is a minimum of what we must do," said Mr Masuulis on Tuesday at the conference in the State Development Fund and the State Journal.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important, as important projects will have to be implemented - finished to build Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, built by Klaipėda external port, renovated Vilnius and Kaunas airport, and perhaps built a new airport.
"After the decade, it will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of the external port of Klaipeda, managing airports, perhaps deciding on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, now start projects that will take advantage of our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masuulis has said that too little money has been spent on car traffic surveillance in recent years.
"The road conditions are not improving until now, because the money is being spent insufficiently.
We have been able to build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, for example on highways, is lacking.
We must determine the amount to be allocated to the supervision of the road if we want their situation to improve," said Mr Masuulis.
He stressed that the exports of services to the Lithuanian transport sector increased by 18.6% this year and the largest export market became Germany, covering Russia.
Mr Masuulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU country carriers should periodically return to the country of registration.
"We must strive for our exporters in Western Europe to feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for a full return to the house is absurd, as empty trucks, fuel, and emissions in Europe would increase.
Most of this will result in railways because the costs will rise to the extent that some of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position," said Mr Masuulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, 12.2% of the transport sector is established.
Lithuanian general domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and employs more than 7,500 companies.
Conflict with heirs
Last week, Mr Masuulis, in the Committee on Economic Affairs, announced the beginning of negotiations on the change in the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow for the removal of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis, Mr Masiulis, called for political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the last decade is a value, registered in 1993, not for politics, and specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr Masuulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"From the legacy to withdraw that old terminal would be a political step to break it down and build a new modern terminal of arrival, that in the retreats of Vilnius it would be felt in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative of our country as innovative," said Mr. Masiulis last week.
Mr Masuulis also reported that in Kaunas it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica cancer by building the underground station.
This transport space should operate in 2026 after the end of the rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected that it will be 4.8 million passengers, and the next year it will be 5 million.
The Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year, Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, Vilnius Airport will miss the largest scheduled flights to Boeing 767, which travels directly from Lithuania to the island of Bee, on the basis of the information provided by the travel organizer "Itaka Lithuania", writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that passengers from Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business classes.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Millowskis, Director General of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour organizers prepared new travel routes for the summer 2019 season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to talk about disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
As much as I want to be happy, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we're collecting reserves for the third year.
But also a very important thing is not to talk about diseases," Mr Shapoka said on Monday when he was in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miguel Tuskienė attends meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting addresses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenue received for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian budget as incompatible with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC takes advantage of this option.
More information is requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the strengthening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buracz.
Lithuanian Labour Traditions and Practices
Recently, 120 years after the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural scholar, ethnographer and country scholar Bali Burač (1897-1972) in the Sidarian Valley of Šiaulė, then Šiaulių governorate.
Remembering the 100-year anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the avalanche of life has caused many Lithuanian people, including Brother Burachus - Bala, Jonah, Bronius - from the very depths of the village to be able to engage in the collection, assembly and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balis Buracza, who spent more than 50 years traveling around the country with a camera in his hands, presented a broad and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing strains of national culture and had a rare ability to grasp the lasting value of his work.
In the photos of Balio Buracho, Lithuania's landscape, pilgrims, daily and holy environments have decorated Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains much of the legacy of Bali Burač to describe national practices and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and severe occupations.
In the handwriting of the book, there is a great deal of intermediation of the Earth, especially of the culinary, northern, tidal, as well as of the works of the people of the Upper and the Dzungian, their festivals and other traditions and customs recorded by Bali Burač.
Some 100 000 negatives from museums and archives have been selected for this publication over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos that are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characterized by bathrobes, mushrooms, other areas of the Highlands and the Earth.
The suspect left the police car for 4 hours left.
As a young man (in 1994) was able to get out of the service car, officials are not yet revealing.
He was taken to the prison to suspect that he was a thief.
About 16 hours ago, the police distributed a photo of the bee and asked the public for help: "From the van of the service car, the suspected mayor, Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994).
The person ran away with the rings.
Please inform tel. 112 or 8700 60000 upon observing this person.
Added.
17.35 p.m.
The police department reported: "The suspect is detained in Panevėžž, he is threatened with another case for trying to escape.
Thank you all for your help.
Tragic Marriage Remuneration: Killed Just After A few Hours of Marriage
In the south-west of the United States of Texas, a couple of young people were killed during a hurricane disaster just a few hours earlier.
24 years old William Troy's Byler and his partner, Bailee Ray Ackerman Byler, who died on Sunday after a midnight break in the hill 16 km north west of Juvaldje and 129 km west of San Antonio, said the local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster occurred about 20 miles (24 km) away, just as many young people have been.
A 76-year-old helicopter pilot named Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young leaders studied at the State University of Samo Houston, located in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Bylerian family's hand near Juvaldi and after the wedding, they went out to the family of a helicopter.
The accident occurred about 20 miles [24 km] after a hurricane.
The young drivers flew to Sant Antonia’s international airport, where they intended to take a flight to the airport and fly the honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, without indicating the destination of the final couple’s trip.
"It's a very rocky, uneven relief area, and it's about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence has been flying that family aircraft for many years.
According to Mr. Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should explain the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after rise.
Its break-up was a large beam on a rock hill, and the body remained "dangerous", said Air Safety Explorer Craig Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday during the press conference.
The researchers intend to get rid of the debris and then take a thorough look at it, but the train and the truck will not be easy to reach, he spoke.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published within two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister is calling for the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran as a "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to members of his party 'Likud' parliament, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donaldui) Trump (Donaldui Trampi), the United States introduces a particularly strict sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time when efforts have been made to provoke his aggression," said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) stated that the new sanctions would cause a "critical" blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls "the most severe of all time sanctions" began to be applied after the month of May, which was adopted and which was opposed to the decision to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
The aim of the sanctions is to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which has already reached about a million barrels a day since May, and to remove Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long rejected that agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance the fighting groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow him to take military action there.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been foreseen, has so far not allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The court reenacts the circumstances of the young motorcyclist's death
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the city of North, will be heard by the court in the event of an accident.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius District Court decided that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness would be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
The case has already been brought before the Court of Justice, but the Court does not agree with it.
On August 22nd, the Vilnius City District Court for the death of a motorcyclist car driver, 79-year-old Edward Osipov, announced that the motorcyclist in the city was in high speed and had a serious breach.
The Vilnius District Court asks the District Court to cancel the District Court's judgment and claims that the highest charge for the accident is due to E. Osipov and that the District Court's findings are not justified.
A lawyer from the family of the family of a motorcyclist also asks for the judgment to be abolished.
Avarija took place on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours when E. Osipovo's car "Skoda Fabia" from the Lakūnų street entered the street of Žirmūnų and faced the main road bike.
The prosecutor accused the man that the driver of the car violated the road traffic rules and caused a traffic accident - a man who was killed on the main road by a motorcycle "Piaggo".
The first police reports indicate that the engine driver died, but later after the tests, it was found that the vehicle was potentially comparable to the motorcycle.
The judge of the Vilnius City District Court Roland Buzinskas BNS has said that the experts have found that the motorcyclist was driving 89.2 kilometers at an hourly speed, although the speed at that place is permissible - 50 kilometres at an hour.
"The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," said the judge.
At the time, the driver of a noble old car said that it was only 5 to 6 kilometres in an hour.
The driver trying to stop and step away from the vehicle after a break with Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor believes that from the side of the main road, E. Osipovas had to give the road to the motorcyclist.
"Novaja Gazette": Six "Vagner" Samdi died in Syria

The source of the "New Journal" is published in Syria.
According to the source, one of the parts of the 5th Syrian military force corps was deployed in that area, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military offices" have joined.
"New Gazette" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on the Russian fate.
The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a parental test
This Decision is part of the victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
It has been seeking recognition of the former monarch child since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert's II had a short love novel decades ago.
The former king of 84 is negative for his father.
According to the RTBF, he may refer to the Supreme Court, as opposed to a DNA study.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the former husband of the Delphine mother - is neither biological nor legally an artist's father.
For the investigation in question, Delphine asked to be recognized as Albert's father's daughter.
The UK will allocate money to the parties, but will not give anything to the social workers
This week, the High Electoral Commission (VEC) intends to allocate almost EUR 3 million of the budget to the largest political parties.
This spring, the ruling party of the Socialist Party of Lithuania (LDDP) established under the leadership of Vice-President Gedimin Kirkil of Parliament until the budget has been allocated.
However, they may be granted by a separate decision of the PRC in the near future if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties is changed.
Laura Matyošäitte, the president of the VRC, informed the U.S. that "this Thursday is scheduled for a Commission meeting, which is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of half-yearly budget grants to the parties".
In their view, the PRC must take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
It is planned for seven parties, six of which are parliamentarians, to allocate EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition association of Fathers-Lithuania Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million for the governing union of the States and the Greens - about EUR 0.55 million for the opposition social Democrats - about EUR 0.5 million for the opposition party, about EUR 0.4 million for the Liberal community, seven working parties not belonging to the group - about EUR 0.23 million for the newly joined party of the ruling parties in the dispute and justice - almost EUR 0.22 million for the parliamentary representatives, but not the ruling or opposition to the non-governmental association of the Polish elections-Christian families - about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the current law, which, in the allocation of the budget, also by the Head of the CRA, grants to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the recent elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only this spring to expect the LSDDP established to receive money from the budget.
However, this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers get at least a few hundred thousand euros in the next three elections - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendment to the budget laws of the political parties and this year of the Seimas was adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the rulings, Mr Kirkiles and the Green Leader of the countries, Ramūnas Karbausskis, believe that the MPs will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's VRK meeting, so, according to Mr Matyoshitė, "the grants will be distributed in accordance with the legal procedure that has been in place so far".
Indeed, the Head of the CSR did not reject that if Seimas rejected the President's veto and the new amendments to the budget allocations to the parties this week, the Commission may consider a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When we make a decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the executive authority to have the laws adopted," she said.
If Seimas was able to reject veto and new laws would enter into force, the Government would have allocated additional money to the parties, which would have further borrowed the appropriate amounts.
Seven parties have already been allocated grants for such a decision.

Counsel: Activists to Kill Handziuk must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 - will not be rejected.
Each will be carefully checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to get information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
It will only be possible to learn the truth and condemn the evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he is the most interested in all that the murder of Mr Handziuk would be explained, and the murderers, the organizers of the crime and the "responsibility" of the order.
"After this case has been reclassified to murder, they are completely right and reasonably threatened by imprisonment to the death penalty," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the requirement of the public to examine this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government has firmly decided to attract criminals and murderers on their own account."
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help clarify the situation, but would further confuse it.
"I call on all, both the government and the opposition-supporting forces, not to find out the unwarranted arguments and, in God's defense, not to use this murder in public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now have to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast, so that the public confidence can be built.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation for destabilization in the country," he said.
In July, before the battle of corruption, Mr. Handziuk was hit by acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an adviser to this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but on Sunday she died in the hospital.
In the absence of an explanation by the police and the prosecutors of this attack, on Tuesday, the Attorney General of Ukraine, Jurius Lucenka, made a statement of resignation.
After her death, the public officials complained that it was not possible to carry out a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Secretary-General of the Prosecutor-General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I will present my resignation today," said Mr Lucenka to Members of Parliament, reading my investigation report.
Parliament has yet to accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka blamed the activists for pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, so it was difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates delivered the toilet without water
On delivery of a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates' transition from traditional such facilities to a waterless revolution compared to the previous eight-year-old computer revolution.
The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water pipes, reported "Reuters".
The toilet without water works in accordance with the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste types are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the past 200 years," Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
A technological toilet was created by a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Over the seven years, the fund has spent $200 million on a facility that could turn human waste into a waste or water.
A total of 20 toilet models were created, in the words of Bill Gates.
The plant is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Fund is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gate Foundation, poor sanitation conditions in the world cause the deaths of 500 thousand children every year for up to five years.
The fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, is increasing the amount of funds already spent on health care for 233 billion people.
In order to better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented a glass of faeces to the toilet presentation.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example, "there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasites."
Slyva, elected by the President of the Association of Massive Football
On 5 November, in Kaunas, there was an informal meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association, in which Sergei Slyva was elected president of the new organisation.
As a result of the request made by Anatolius Stecenko to resign from the office of president of the Association, an informal universal meeting of members of the Association was convened.
It was attended by 13 members from 15.

Anxiety in France: Concern leads to people's deaths
On Monday, the French Health Officers announced a permanent ban on the use of widely used pesticides, causing concern over several decades of the country's population in the West.
The ANSES Health Agency announced that the decision to prohibit all products with pesticides was adopted after a new safety check started earlier this year, even before at least three September, in the department of the department of Meno and Luara.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be associated with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it has been used for about 700 tons a year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained about breathing problems in the Anje region, where there are lots of salty fruits, eye and throat transplants.
"These episodes corroborate the justice of our decision, but did not try it," said Deputy Director Francoise Weber (França Weber) to the newspaper "Ouest France".
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - the US Environment Agency (US EPA) considers to be "probably human carcinogenic".
This pesticide, sold in names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe for up to 2022 when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether it has alternatives," said F. Weber.
"We understand what challenges will arise for producers of salty vegetables, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metama in a region whose economy is highly dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad crops consumed in Europe are produced in close proximity to Nanto.
The next season will be "a little less salty, bitter and married" last month, after the government has stopped using metam, the news agency AFP told Nanto's Federation of Producers Philippe's Retiere's (Philippines Retjeras).

President Paul Biya, sworn to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after the controversial elections
During the ceremony held by Parliament President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old P. Biya promised to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African State.
The most recent African President, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced in the election of the winner of the 7th October, with 71% vote.
The elections, however, had a low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
P. Inaugural inaugural evening 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were arrested in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English separatists carried out a armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking, and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016 in the North West and the neighbouring South West Province, there was a need for autonomy in the areas of alleged discrimination in education, justice and economics.
In 2017, when Biya refused to give up, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of the Ambasion", and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security officers died during the separatist attacks and government operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have escaped from violence: some have crossed the border to Nigeria, but many have forced to live in semi-arid forests.
During the October elections in the North West region, only 5% of the voters voted, and 15% of the electorate in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya gathered two-thirds of the votes.
Primary Conservatories' Elections: Errors Caused by Non-Expert
"When things are missing - you understand that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed access to their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them themselves.
Thank you to those who have moved," said the politicians.
According to him, complaints were brought, but their content does not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not of a bad nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all participants in the elections were experienced - this was also new to them.
Thus, not all of our actions were consistent with this.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRK to comply with the principles we described.
These complaints are still not the basis for doubting the results," said Anushauskas.
According to the president of the CRK, there have been cases where the ballots have not been printed - after knowing this, the ballots found in the polls have been cancelled without a print.
In some cities, however, there was a lack of space, says A. Anushausko, complaints and violations related to several ten bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it does not really make a difference in the results of the elections," explained Anushauskas.
It is said that the party's members' activity in the elections was 55%, while the non-participants' activity was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 were working on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - for the winner Ingrid Shimonyts voted 79% of the voters (16418 votes), while for Vygaudas Ushakak 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LCD Council will officially support the application of I. Šimonytė in the election of the President of the country in May of the following year.
A short saying probably won't meet Putin in Paris
The White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that D. Trumpas will meet with V. Putin in Paris, where this week will be held at the end of the 100th anniversary of World War I.
However, in the last minutes before the U.S. Central Congress elections, Mr. Shortas told reporters that it would be a good opportunity to meet with the President of Russia.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the US President.
However, the head of the White House has been added, and they will be seen during the G-20 Summit and "probably many times" thereafter.
D. Short continues to attempt to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia will join the 2016 US President's elections.

Former Director-General of the University of Vilnius of Santaros, Kostutis Strupas asks for the annulment of the Decision of the Central Service Ethics Commission (CPC) - it is recognised that transactions have not been declared in time and thus infringed law.
On Tuesday, Mr Strupos’ complaint was examined by the Vilnius District Administrative Court.

S. Strupienė also declared these transactions when the deadlines expired.

Schools already want to learn differently: promise less tests, more practice
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in the content of education, which was presented to them in Vilnius on Monday at the Forum "Translational content change: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
In the course of the discussion, Minister for Education and Science Jurgita Petrausskienė said that over the last ten years, EUR 30 million has been invested in the renewal of the content of education, but the results are not clear.
"In line with the results of the international research on student achievements in PISA, the achievements of students are below the average of the OECD countries," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrausskienė.
The report by the Ministry of Education and Science quoted by EPO expert Phil Lambert (Fila Lambert) said that Lithuania was too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programmes focus on the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility for education, but also on the creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy for children.
The Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Ms. Garjvydas Kazakevičius, presented changes in the content of general education, said that these years would start to update the scope of the programmes, they would be more specific, more closely linked to discipline.
According to the Deputy Minister, education will be more individualized, schools will become more self-sufficient - they will be able to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current learning assessment system will turn into a cumulative score, greater weight gain and informally acquired learning skills.
Small standardised tests.
The general education programmes are expected to be digital, user-friendly, connected to the e-sources entrusted to the bank.
The update of the content of education aims to improve students' achievements in the international PISA study at least 10%, and a third reduction in the gap between pupils' achievements and the modern skills acquired in school would be written in various areas.
Since May 2018, Lithuania plans to renew the content of the education programme to cover the amount of EUR 7.8 million in the European Union and the State budget.
It is expected that the draft general education programmes will be updated in 2019-2020, and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry raised criticisms about the draft value of almost EUR 8 million for the Centre for the Development of Education for the renewal of the initial, primary and secondary education programmes.
The first purchase of EUR 1,3 million for four years was announced at the beginning of October, which was sought by educational programmemakers.
After criticising this purchase, he was suspended, Minister of Education and Science Mr. Petrauskienė fired Giedriės Vaidel, Director of the Centre for the Development of Education.
In Lithuania - exercises how to react to extreme floods
On Monday in Lithuania, ten-day practices are under way to improve the response of institutions to the extreme flood.
As informed by the Fire Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will examine how state authorities are prepared to work in the country after the state-level emergency, such as the flood: to eliminate its effects, coordinate the search for people, rescue and rapid deployment from the affected areas, to organise their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary supply of energy and to provide other protection measures for the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of the centres of emergency operations in 12 municipal situations will take part in the exercises.
On 5-13 November, a preparatory exercise will take place, at which time the municipalities, which received information from the hydrometeorological service from the PAGD on non-consistency and starting the flood, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active exercise phase is scheduled for November 14-15 days.
It will be operated in the department by the State Emergency Operations Centre and in the state and municipal authorities, the institutions emergency Operations Centres.
After publication to the Government of the state-level extreme situation on the effects of the floods, the chief of operations appointed by the Head of Operation for the eradication of the extreme situation, the elimination of its effects, the protection and rescue of the population and assets.
Deputy Director Mindaugas Kanapickas says that in practice it is important to verify the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibility of exchanging information, to verify how the emergency is prepared to warn and inform citizens, public and municipal authorities, institutions and businesses, and to "improve the powers of the management of state institutions' emergency situations".
Practices will also demonstrate the overall capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-fighters to pump a large amount of water from the affected areas.

Defends Ukraine Attorney General Jurijus Lucenka
Ukraine's Attorney General Jurius Lucenka announced on Tuesday in the country's parliament the resignations for the resonance caused by the acidic battle against corruption by Katerinas Gandziuk, the Ukrainian news agency Union.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Attorney-General's application for resignation must be submitted to the President of the country, and this is a request by the Supreme Council to approve the majority of votes.
On Tuesday, the Attorney General, Mr Lucenko, presented a law enforcement investigation on the execution of the murder order by Mr Gandziuk and the results of the Supreme Council.
In his speech, he described the study as effective, but expressed the conviction that Mr Gandziuk's death is being used for public relations.
Mr. Gandziuk was an activist in Ukraine, fighting corruption, publicly speaking about police corruption in the town of Chersson in southern Ukraine.
On 31 July, an unknown attack by K. Gandziuk on the face of an acidist was launched at her home.
On 4 November, she died in a hospital for injuries suffered.
Protesters to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require an answer, which killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix from there.
According to Mr. Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation may include 12 persons related to the order for the murder of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was lost to the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Attorney-General, they received substantial knowledge as a result of the loss of information.
Mr Lucenko has added to his personal acquaintance, Mr Gandziuk, and I am confident that some politicians are taking advantage of her blood to public relations.
"When no one has reason to say that someone is acting in good faith, I would like to say that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today, and you will have to discuss this in Parliament," said Mr Lucenko in the Council quoted the publication Obozrevatel.
It is written that Mr Lucenko added that "it is impossible to allow double-government in a country where the law enforcement system is violated without any evidence, even for exposed crimes".
Mr Lucenko is considered a close associate of President Peter Poroshenko of the country.
On 12 May 2016, he was appointed by the Prosecutor-General to remove his predecessor, Viktor Šokina, who was suspected of overcoming the corruption of top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Z. Vaikiņas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta informed the Energy Minister's adviser Aurelia Vernickaitė, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to data from the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector without currently pursuing the tractors at EU level in the national renewable energy action plans - the share of renewable energy in 2015 was 6%.
In the EC's assessment, progress towards a mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a wide range of difficulties, including costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unexplained regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity is less important at this stage.
Seimas has taken on issues related to the proposed corruption investigation to supplement preservatives’ referrals to the KT
On Tuesday after the submission, the Seimas endorsed a proposal that was registered for an investigation into the illegal influence of political processes in the "state" of Agna Širinskienė.
There were 58 Seimas members, nine MPs detained before - 27.
The Seimas Committees will discuss the draft, which is primarily appointed by the Committee on Legal and Legal Affairs, headed by Mr Širinskienė.
Following its conclusion, the vote will be taken on the adoption of the resolution.
A new political corruption investigation is currently being conducted by the Seimas Interim Investigation Commission to explain the possible illegal impact in 2008-2016.
Mr Širinskienė suggested that this deadline should be extended by stating that "there has been significant information in the public area about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public authorities".
A. Širinskienė lists "the possibility of representing the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or calling on the Constitutional Court or the attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Commission for the Ethics of Service".
Appeals to the Constitutional Court for pensions were initiated by the opposition conservators.
The "states" authorities have found that conservatives have largely supported their claims by private pension fund lawyers.
I would like to thank the Heads of State for the influence of the Chief Commission for Ethics (CETEC) on the former Povil Urbša community.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Committee of Management and Municipalities of the Seimas State could refer to members of the VTEEC the duty to forgive the former Head of the Commission's Prevention Division of Mindaugas Lakes.
At the end of September, the Seimas established a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of stakeholders or their groups, the impact of the elections, the formation of coalitions, the creation of parliamentary groups, the work and financing of individual policies, parties and public movements, the legislative processes, the election of State-run undertakings, the heads of public institutions, the management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities, as they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
At the same time, the presidential campaign will be carried out by the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the "States".
Their members also appointed two social workers, after one "order", a liberal and representative of the Lithuanian-Christian family union of Polish elections.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by the President of the Lithuanian Government and Green Union Ramūnas Karbausskis.
In his opinion, a study by the National Security and Defence Committee (NCSC) was carried out in principle on the same subjects, which showed that the study should be continued.
The German Internal Intelligence Director lost his post
In 55 C.E., Mr. Maassena's controversy was further thwarted by the statement that his troubles were caused by the "radical left forces" of Mr Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but was forced to leave the reserve.
In addition, last weekend it appeared that a few weeks ago, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw, Mr Maassenas criticised the "innovation" immigration policy.
For a long time, German Interior Minister Horstas Seehoferis at the press conference that took place on Monday stated that H.G. Maasseno's previous comments were unacceptable and "inflicted in person".
Mr Seehoferis, himself in the press for both this dispute and for the poor appearance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen into custody.

A girl in the middle of a girl sneezes stereotypes about wedding dress
A naked girl with a white tumbling suit - a mission (not) possible?
Can white bed above the size of S or M and still appear attractive?
The participants in the Plus-Size Realty show "Evolution" will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the valley really do not depend on women's kilograms.
But that's not all yet - one of the girls in the project this evening will blow up the winner's ass - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
"There are also those who think that the greatest girls don't get the attention of the boys or the sights.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me what I am, he doesn't want me to meet any standards," Aurika said before she showed up with a wedding dress.
The wedding dress is not easy, in all respects, clothing - it's a complex structure, it's a lot of materials, it's a hard dress, it's not easy to move.
Also, some women believe that the bigger girl in the white dress will appear even bigger and therefore less reliable.
I can be disappointed that a well-chosen dress model really solves this "problem"", explained one of the Commission's members, fashion designer Robert Kalkinin.
The rest of the girls in the project, R. Kalkinina, together with the entire commission, opens a plus-size fashion houses to Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukt.
"In deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of Thursdays among the members of the Commission - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dress has been even more difficult, and that - now I can reveal - is that there have been two young people who have really not been worse than the nuns.
It was a special evening in all respects," says Kalkinina.
In 23 years of scandalous behavior on one summer reality show, Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty, the mother of two children, Dovilė, as well as the other girls, participated in the selection of "Divine (r) evolution" and attended the best 20th.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo sessions of girls in Vilnius city streets, they had to say good-bye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
A second week of international recognition has taken place in Lithuania since the arrival of the beauty show - here, plus the size of girls competes for the name of the star of the first country.
Until there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly that the winner can be only one.
The exciting and unexpected reality show "Divine Evolution" begins this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. during the LNK.
actor I. Elba selected the most sexy man in the world
The U.S. Journal People published this year's most sexy man in the world.
It became British actor Idris Elba for 46 years.
Although the man said that this knowledge was unexpected, he did not stand out as a joke.
I thought, "Can't be!
Are you sure?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I appear sexually, - laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title was a very pleasant feeling that touched his ego.
The British star often believed that he was “very high and poor” by keeping up with the words and customs of the foolish, who made his childhood uncomfortable.
The young actor did not believe in and become a facilitator for his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"I've just caught him in the dark, and I've become the toughest guy in my city district," said Idris.
When men fail to be proud on Ose’s screens, I. Elba works in the evenings prepared in Spain, and especially at Ibiso.
In time, a man enjoys the Thai box and has a bowl of tea made by making his own dress line.
The British actor believes that he is the most important person in the world - a family, so he plans to marry Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the most sexually elected man in the 33rd People magazine.
In 2017, the title was attended by Blake Shelton.

Governors do not require 20 km away when building waste incineration plants
The cogeneration force of Vilnius is set in front of the Gariún Tower.
The managers do not want to maintain a distance of 20 km from the population when building waste incineration plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee Kęstutis Mažeika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law on Monday Seime, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the "States" group, having previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, is required to support the amendment on the grounds of its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that since January 2019, electricity for heating waste could be subject to the environmental and public health requirements laid down by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment prompted the President's doubts about such an insurance.
"In view of the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it is almost impossible to find places where the above-mentioned objects could be constructed," says the Chairman of the Committee.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto amendments to the building of the waste incineration power plant in October.
In addition to building more than 20 km from the population, the amendments provided for the Government's permission to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already established, taking into account the public's health interests.
Mr Mažeika does not propose to amend the latter provisions.
In Vilnius, the energy group "Lithuania Energy", and in Kaunas, together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum" in Fortum Heat Lietuva, was created with the energy company "Forum Heat Lietuva".
The latter is already burning the remains in Klaipeda.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider this proposal, but has rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In the talk, Th. May "has made it possible to review the insurance mechanism", it states.
"The Ombudsman has allowed it to be understood that there is open for the review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review does not relate to the unilateral decision to put an end to the use of restrictive measures," says the government report.
Brexit's negotiators do not accept a decision to avoid checks at the UK and Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the common market and customs union next year.
The two parties agree on 'insurance measures' to maintain the open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the entire United Kingdom.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the secretary of Brexit, Dominicas Raabas, is seeking Britain to withdraw from the insurance agreement on the one hand after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "can't support it".
"For three months or a limited period of time, the insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they will be placed," he said.
London and Brussels had previously failed to confirm the information on Brexit's breakthrough in the negotiations after the weekend of the British report that the agreement is reached by hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr May, representative of London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Schinas, also told reporters, "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of emerging thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, made a statement on Monday, calling for the right to obtain reliable information during the Internet era.
Among the 25 persons who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists of Amartya Old (Amartja Old) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglicas), the Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Literature Prize winner Mario Vargas Llossa (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
"We encourage good will leaders in all countries to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," said the Group's report.
They argue that "the global area of information and communication" is a common good, which "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to obtain information which is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of the truth of the commitment, the principles of pluralism of views and the methods of establishing rational facts," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including President Donald Trump (Donald Tramp), who often criticises "false news", but who is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when the signatories called for a meeting in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was prepared within two months under the direction of Mr. Ebadi and Mr. Christophe Deloire (Christian Delaure), the head of the media freedom and journalists' rights defence organization in Paris, Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the other signatories are former President of Senegal Abdou Dioufas (Abdu Diufas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and politician Francis Fukuyama (France).
Seimas confirmed greater penalties for harmful products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Law, which provide that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The resolution was adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Mr Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas Health Committee, said about the new project, welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also compatible with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, the proposed draft law, is better and more specifically allocated to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines is not always a barrier to further violations, because the entities who have paid the fine continue to commit repeated violations," said Mr. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The legislative amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer rights protection, give more power to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of product safety and compliance.
As the Ministry of Agriculture states, producers are currently not under an obligation to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry said that the market surveillance authorities were not allowed to access the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, and to carry out inspections, which made it difficult to carry out the work of the authorities.
The evaluation by the Ministry, which lays down a six-month deadline for the award of fines and warnings, is too short to detect an infringement, conduct an investigation and appoint a penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
The company often repeatedly violates the requirements of the law - only during 2017 did this to 14 companies.
The Ministry of Agriculture proposed that producers should be obliged to properly label the product and ensure its traceability so as to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to carry out inspections by operators producing products, premises, premises, premises, premises.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
For the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of dangerous products placed on the market and for the distributor, the service provider or the service provider concerned would be subject to a penalty of EUR 150 to 2,500 (now EUR 144 to EUR 1.448).
The State Consumer Rights Authority (VTTAT) or another market surveillance authority has decided to prohibit the placing on the market of dangerous products and the provision of dangerous services, from 1 000 to 5 000 (now from 868 to 4 344), would be awarded a fine of EUR.
Without a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, the penalty would be EUR 2500 to 6,500 (now EUR 1,448 to 5,792).
If dangerous products have been harmful to the health of the consumer, the penalty would be EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584).
If dangerous products resulted in the death of the consumer, the penalty would be EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to EUR 23 169).
According to the Ministry, the infringement of product safety legislation in Poland and Austria is granted up to EUR 25 000 (unspecified minimum fine), in Belgium, from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, in Romania, from EUR 155 to EUR 666, in Bulgaria, from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO's remotest and most remote areas
The soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital, Oslo.
This is part of NATO exercises "Third League 2018" - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 11th of September spent a long time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they have been able to fight under the Arctic, and these skills are very useful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, on the east side of the Tinset mountains, often in the remotest and most remote areas, the soldiers participated in the staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the ability to survive in this source in the wild, but in the cool climate they have a much larger weight on their shoulders - one cup weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers standing at the headquarters say that they share their skills in surviving and fighting under such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the military, these practices, which, like any other, will bring to mind real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Eastern European Studies Centre for Cooperation with Two Marked "Smegen Centres"
According to the statement by the head of RESC Lino Kojalas, established in Vilnius for the past 30 years, the US will implement projects and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working this way for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions have appointed us as partners and seek opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will occur, as we are analysed by NATO, security, disinformation, and the development of the Eastern Partnership States are also priority issues," Kojala said.
The agreements indicate that the work of the RESC and the US authorities in preparing applications for international projects together will be subject to the exchange of expertise and expertise in the preparation of expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been active since 1955 and is one of nearly one hundred highest-level analysts.
At the latest University of Pennsylvania, FPRI, a world-wide rating of analytical centres, took the seventh place in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work with the top U.S. political institutions, marks ten in the same rating in its category.

Among the RESC partners with which joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
