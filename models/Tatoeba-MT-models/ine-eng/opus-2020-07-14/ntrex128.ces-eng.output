The members of the Kingdom Hall are concerned that they will "be like Mupeti"
Some of the members of the Swedish Assembly are consternations from the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Hungarian Parliament)
The purpose of the proposal is to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the meetings, in opposition to the political spectrum, are concerned that the name could bring ridicule.
One member for the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned that "it is being held against Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the reign of twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member on the part of Plaid said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was coming to change the name "with an open mind", but noted that MWP is close to the Muppet word.
In this context, the English word "w" is similar to the word "u" in the Irish language.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on what will be called the members of the assembly will of course be on the members of the assembly."
The Swedish Government Act of 2017 gave the German assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given the option of calling the assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the meeting, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the meetings are obviously proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus can bring the concerns of President Elin Jones, who has to submit a legislative proposal for several weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
The members of the assembly shall vote on the question of their title in the course of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will go to vote on a change in country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia".
A separate vote should resolve dozens of years of ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim to the Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the EU and NATO application.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a supporter of the plebiscite for the change of name, said he would not vote.
The rapporteur, including President Zoran Zaeva, argues, however, that the change in the name is simply a price for entry into the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
"The elderly people I spoke to say that there was a bar and church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People meet today in a different way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living room of a quarter where people walk on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such people who do not help the remaining saints in the quarter.
"The simple majority of people who buy apartments in these homes will be white," he says, "and that is why soon will come a day when these churches are closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white - haired Methodist congregation was moved in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, whose worship was not far away.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of a small shopkeeper's boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping bulwark in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s Pharisees planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, called the belloon proudly "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irrevocable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger bell game in the church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says that no one has hurt him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s story of architects and designers, some of whom have been called late church representatives, and others of the episcopal diocese.
The council of the elders, the head of the Fartian Authority, consisting of the lay representatives, sent a letter in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to raise costs" to the council of the elders, although the appointment of architects and founders who sent the diocese was not at all involved.
Some Pharisees complained about insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who got warmed up for lobsters
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California for lobsters on the day of the start of the humming season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 o'clock in the vicinity of the Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he had been warmed up with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he went down with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that the call was first considered to be a joy from the capture of humr, but “then he realized that he was shouting, ‘Shoot me!
Look at me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had broken the entire area of the key bone."
“I cried that everyone would go out of the water: ‘In the water is a well!’” Hammel added.
The boy was in critical condition transported by a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of mirror is behind the attack.
Dr. Larry Giles said at the press conference that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was intended not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury in the upper part of the body.
The authorities for investigation and security closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's wants to build a range of Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's cosmic streets in the style of a business house, where specialised shops will be available.
As a result of a strong market approach with cosmetics in the UK, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and domestic needs decrease, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 sales throughout the country.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find the use of gears used for television, microwaves and household needs.
Sainsbury's suggests that it doubles the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products and first, it also introduces brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the current range from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees brand places like Boots.
Supermarket also again introduces its make-up Boutique range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are still demanding more.
In addition, in two Saintsbury’s sales, the concession will be tested by the retail sales dealer Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and will occur next year in Sely Oak in Birmingham.
Buying online and moving towards daily buying a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says sales will increasingly look like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discounted sales, such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales by Argos and also introduced a number of Habitats departments, which were chains that he bought two years ago. This increased food and supplies sales are even more profitable.
The previous Supermarket attempt to transform the department with a cosmetic and medical range ended in vain.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the dispute over the distribution of drug sales results in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold his 281 doctors for 125 million pounds of Celesio, which owns Lloyds’s network.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding to four sales an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We changed the view and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specialized colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our brand's range should satisfy all needs and moods and the beneficial location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "dissolved" after Holly Willoughby left the contract for 11 million pounds.
Dragons Day Peter Jones star after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth $11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing brand and Truly's accessories.
The company of this couple was compared to Goop's art label Gwyneth Paltrow.
A seven-year-old moderator announced his departure to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby stard the Dragons Dan Peter Jones series by leaving their luxurious lifestyle business for the last time – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to Jones' informed sources, when a TV star at a busy Tuesday meeting in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that, due to the new contracts, up to 1.5 million pounds, it will no longer be able to devote enough time to their household clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to Goop's actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When a seven-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave the Truly mark, Jones went from Britain to one of his summer seats.
The above-mentioned source states: “Truly’s daughter-in-law was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which will ensure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was totally shocked.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the release was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is a full stock of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of this Morning series, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could be a millionth of the company in view of the bold investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and the possible further delay of the mark.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and Dan Baldwin's husband have been friends of Jones for ten years and his wife, Tara Cappov.
Willoughby founded the Truey brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and 20-year-old Jones joined the Presidency in March.
Couples travel together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambassador of the M&S brand and replaces Anta McPartlina with the I'm A Celebrity series on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his business".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He mocked the criticisms he received from reporters for a note that some consider to be "an inappropriate president" and for how he speaks positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump replied with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump considered as a major step towards denouncing North Korea, Kim was interested in further meetings.
But the deal about the elimination of nuclear weapons stuck to the dead point.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders on Saturday at the UN Valne Assembly that North Korea does not see the "responsibility" of its first steps towards disarmament.
The United States continues instead in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump, in his speech, expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were in the area of the North Korean War.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim led to positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of arms and the return of the remains of American soldiers to power.
And he defended his unusual access to information about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside to this overcrowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump and showed up on the floor in front of us.
The waves of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands and killed hundreds of people
In the situation following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok were expelled from their homes, a national disaster was not reported, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization, however, is giving together a team that travels to Pala, but it is still not clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
Speaking for the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutupo said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations would be able to help.
Since earthquakes occur in Indonesia very often, the land of the wrath of the Mother Nature is still sadly unprepared.
In Aceha, however, the tsunamis were built, but on other parts of the coast it is not even common.
The loss of human life is likely to have contributed to the apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against tsunamis, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best time, travelling among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
A non-manufacturer, who has been hunting in Lombok and helping the earthquake victim, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of a new kalimata.
The improvement of the poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign of President Joko Widodoa and the president lost a lot of money on the roads and railways.
The next year, he will try again for election, but his government is in the process of narrowing the funding gap.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use swords, bows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed lives for more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot the balancing branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the London Stamford Bridge on Saturday in 89 minutes, saving Liverpool from the Chelsea defeat at the Premier League.
Sturridge got a dog from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He moved his ball to the left and shot it into a remote spot.
The arrow flew high and directed to the right upper corner of the gate.
The sword finally jumped over the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get a ball, and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible," Sturidge told LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante coming near me, so I didn't think much about it, and I shot at one touch."
Chelsea in half-time led 1-0 by the head of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent the dog back to Matthew Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the game and sprinted at half Liverpool.
The ball's been playing fast.
Then he sent the ball to the beautiful streets of Hazard.
He ran away from the defense and left-handed to far-off points near Alison Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday in 15 hours, Liverpool in the league of champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Italy, runs with the local team.
Chelsea will be playing on Thursday at 15 hours in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the wave of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and the wave of tsunamis dropped to 832.
The earthquake on force 7.5 hit a level on Friday, triggered a wave of up to 6 meters high and imprisoned many people in the dusty buildings, said at the press conference of Sutopo Purvo Nugro.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was visited by a number of carved buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
The woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with acute injuries was found at 7.55 on Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people in the neighborhood who saw or heard anything to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says this: “The investigation is just at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who moved near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, in particular the taxi drivers whose boarding cameras could record something to contact us because they can have important information for our investigation,"
The police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene, who think they know a woman to ask where she was found in the morning.
The police have informed us that the investigation is under way, and now they're informing their victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should go to the building or get out of it.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't able to say a word.
The residents have now learned that it will take several hours before they can return home.
One man said that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A paying woman appeared on the scene.
He's still saying, "That's terrible."
At 14 hours there were two police supplies behind the tape, and the others were waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call on line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
Socha Cromwell in Parliament has recently been hit by a dispute about "rewrite history"
His expulsion would be worthy of punishment because his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazyness" and "power to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of the soch, it was inevitable that one of the goals would become Oliver Cromwell's position in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or carry out an iconoclass in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The excellent creation of Cromwell, whose author is Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's view and part of the story that many think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people regard Cromwell, even though today less than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unmistakable historical debates.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century created the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified position that represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of the Protector also stand as a celebration and a reminder."
Killing pigs smashed the Chinese farmer
According to local media, in southeastern China, there was an attack and killing of farmers by pigs.
As the newspaper South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the name "Yuan" was found dead with a remnant of hot blood in his pocket near the market in Liou-pchan-shui in the province of Kui-chou.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in October 30 May 2005 in Si-ning in the Chinese province of Ching-chaj.
Apparently on Wednesday he came with a cousin from the neighbouring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door to the side window was open.
According to him, there was a large blood pressure in the ankle.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250 kilograms per farmer had broken down.
"The brother had his legs all bloody and broken," quoted the journal Guiyang Evening News, named after "Wu".
The security camera record shows how Yuan came to market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't even belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the press had been shut down so that nobody else could think of it when the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
The representatives of the market are allegedly dealing with the Yuan family on compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016 the press attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
About ten years ago, 300kg of pigs brought the Swiss farmer to the tractor and drowned him until the farmer's wife.
After the Congolese farmer ate his pig in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba said the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're scientists... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring to the southwestern United States strong rain
Hurikán Rosa, as predicted, is weak and moves above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the days to come, the rain will be brought to northern Mexico and southwestern USA.
In 5 hours in the morning of the east time, Rosa reached wind speeds 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific it forms a low pressure beam and moves east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, she will be like a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of impact on Monday.
Tropical moisture, then, with the approaching low pressure beam in the following days, causes the potential rain in the Southwest of the United States.
Hits 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous floodwaters, droughts and possible droughts in the desert.
Strong tropical moisture causes the impact will be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially above the majority of Arizona, a 50 to 100 mm impact is expected.
In rapid deterioration of the conditions, due to the dissolved nature of the tropical rain, wave floods may occur.
In view of the danger of tropical collisions, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
A strong rain may cause the canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring local wind and flying dust.
Near the edge of low pressure will bring strong local cuts on some parts of the southern California coast.
A total impact of more than 13 mm may occur, which may result in lower currents of the satin and the sleek vehicles.
It will be the first drop in the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, the isolated tropical hikes begin to reach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and on Tuesday the rain is spreading.
On Tuesday, the strong rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October we can expect intense heat changes throughout the United States, because the Arctic is starting to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be totally warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is in the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebrasce and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to expand their summer heat again.
Most of the areas in the middle and east of the USA are expected to start in the warm autumn with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern shores of the north-east of the USA.
In New York City it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October a high probability of the average temperatures in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh surveyed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the six television channels' fourth-party motions for a judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of having been sexually assaulted, reportedly arrived in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued, and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: the agreement that the Senator had reached in Arizona, Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a daily prosecution investigation.
Christine Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had sucked her at a high school party in her childhood and tried to dress her up.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people are being monitored by Nielsen's agency.
The company calculated average monitoring at stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that sent the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble getting people to look at his office.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in play-off or the Oscars' participation.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest monitoring of all stations, according to Nielsen's agency during the entire day's hearing, on average 5.69 million spectators.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen points out that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the end of the discussion.
The main stage of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republic declared that it would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras caught him in the morning, as protesters shouted at him when he was about to go to the hearing of the judicial commission.
CNN was alive to carry on how a few minutes he got close to his eyes and let himself in.
One woman said, "I'll be standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also said, “You have power over many women.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before the door was closed, he added more to the committee's proceedings.
All cable and television networks were sent live later when the judicial commission had to vote on the submission of the Kavanaugh nominations to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were to be investigated by the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced the talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have to approve the Kavanaugh vote.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicians" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa Mayová, in his discussion with Sunday Times, accused the criticism of his plan to leave the European Union that "politicians" about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mayová will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another conversation that was close to the Prime Minister on the title side, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to each other to choose their duties is "unreasonable".
Shooting Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Waydea Simse, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department found that Dyteon Samson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-degree murder charge.
The authorities published a video with a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and, according to the Sims police, lost the glasses in the fight.
According to the WABF channel under CBS, the police have secured glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson said after the investigation he admitted that Waydea was shot.
According to the defendant, bail was set at USD 350 000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The department thanks the police unit for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminal labs of state police, the Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "silence and effort for justice".
Sims's was 20 years old.
A two-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 points to the match.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was by the team "striking" and "shocking" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Sopca Chill ash on Mexico City
Asphalt, which is flowing from Popacatépetl, hit the southern quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to get close to the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and dust emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of raids and cracks.
On social networks there were images of the front desks of cars covered with thin layer of ashes in some quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the soup, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) south-east of the main city. The last earthquake destroyed Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the annual vote on independence, the police fired with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting the independence of the police and thousands of people engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first year of the independence vote, which was divided by Catalonia.
The policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who had cast eggs and powder after them, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Later on, too, they broke out of the corridors to which the police had to use shoes.
The groups that supported independence for several hours sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" face-to-face the protesting supporters of the Union who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, fourteen people were easily injured during the protests.
The year following the 1 October reference, which Madrid considers illegal but separatist Catalans to be celebrating, remains the tension in the region that still strives for independence.
The majority of the voters spoke for independence, but participation in the elections was low, as the dissipation resistance boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent camps throughout the region tried to put an end to the vote in the polls.
The support groups remained out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration went through, but she had to choose another route.
Eighteen-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who joined a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped in the prospect of gaining independence for Catalan.
“We lived one of the best moments last year.
My parents cried for joy that they could vote, but now we're in a blind alley," he said.
Despite the importance, although close victory in the regional elections last year in December, the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or waited in court for their share in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said that the conflict had stirred politics on both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who have been waiting for the end of last year in court, announced on Saturday that the next year will run for the European Parliament.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the fall in democratic values and repression that we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.

Mengo's trial assured Livingstone of winning 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston won
Livingston, who was sent down from the lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches in the role of Ibrox club manager.
The trial of Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team got to Hybernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership game in the league, and next week it's the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Earlier, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of unbeatable games in the division to six matches, so the chief coach Holt, who was shooting Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried to defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the indiscriminate guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before his neck, because his privilege caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed before the door, then Alan Lithgow just passed the head of Craig Halket in front of the white.
Home was enough to watch the Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could be in standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was created a free head and Livingstone created a shell, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Mengu together, which the ball ran and scored in the middle of the Pacific.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the ball holding, but the home defense for them was invincible, and the barber Liam Kelly had not much work to do.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos made Kelly an intervention.
Scott Pittman's legs were stopped by Rangers Allan McGregora and Lithgow from another standard situation in Livingstone.
In the pouch area of Livingston, the centers that the players constantly cleaned up and two penalty cups came in, after Halket's attack on the deputy Glenn Middleton and the other hand.
"Fenome" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
The phenomenal performance and result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception, and on their way up they continue to surpass expectations.
Their style of games and manhood have almost changed since the return to the peak, but the great praise Holt deserves for how the team has been excavating since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a great organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but these standards don't apply anymore.
Their endings were chabs – only once on the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was waiting for a mixed welcome in Cologne.
When Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29th) at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all smiles.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim is to improve relations between NATO's allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Kolín, where he opened a huge new mix.
In this city there is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of a match, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard – many of them were Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his politics and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Controversy protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others proclaimed as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: Cycling died on the street with a car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
An accident occurred about 10:15 local time near the Beswod Street crossroads with a busy street Evelyn Street in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of the Saturday tragedy in an accident on the Children Street, when the driver got out of the place.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are now trying to identify and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses drive over replacement routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: In trouble, six guards were injured
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the men’s prison in a state of emergency.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
To deal with the emergency, which involved eight prisoners in one wing, specialized supervisors from the Tornado team were called.
The bodyguards suffered mild injuries and were treated locally.
Speaking of the prison service, he said: “The special training of prisoners was given to handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a long time behind the grid."
In Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager had ended up in prison after an attack.
And last October, the police were sent to prison because of the serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked by bullet bullets.
Hurikán Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can thrive)
It is not common for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning against flooding on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trip across Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have been kept up to 320 km away from Phoenix’s tropical storm status or pressure down since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane about 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict cuts 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona up to 150 mm.
In other desert areas of the north-west, including the middle of the Skalist mountains and the Great Mountains, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local fences up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area is dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but they may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
Server weather.com indicates that according to U.S. Drought Monitor service, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
Rosa's Hurricane Road takes her first to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the force of hurricane with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet with the cooler waters of the Pacific, and therefore will lose its power.
It is expected that Mexico will arrive on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, impact will be strong, which represents a great risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the north-west Sonor, total cuts of 75 to 150 mm are expected, with up to 250 mm available,” says the weather.com server.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north, and in the early hours it reaches the border of Arizona. Then it will pass Arizona and in the late afternoon it will enter the south Utah.
“The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the western southwest of the United States,” the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous wave floods and streams of Sutin in the deserts and droughts of the land in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As police reported from Avon and Somerset. Young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in Radstock.
The cops are looking for witnesses who could have on the phone a record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "satisfied vanity and oppression" Democratic parties
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is by rejecting the unrelenting and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that during the process, Kavanaugh had "satisfied vanity and rebellion" by the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and emotionally refused to order Christine Blasey Ford, that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also spoke in favour of her accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "American witnesses were witness to the beauty and quality and courage of Kavanaugh".
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanauga is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service".
The President directly challenged the nomination of Kavanaugh when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't mind, but I'm still moving," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided on "responsibility and obstruction".
The Head of the Republican Party advised the CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of the Senate was expected not later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit vast earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people died of life, from which many of the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Pala on Friday they met at a festival of hundreds of people. At the summer, however, the coast struck up to six meters of waves, which killed many people and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The waves of tsunamis were preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunamis came to light yesterday, people continued in the activities on the beach, and they did not run away immediately, so they fell behind the victim," said a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugro's Bryffin in Jakarta.
"Volna tsunami did not go alone, took cars, shops, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the attack on the coast, the wave of tsunami on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled to the trees before the flood and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Aerial photographs that the Agency has published for the mitigation of the loss show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and mixed with water.
The consequences were cut off by the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that energy was released by the fifth-grade power surges approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb-fired power in the second world war in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of long, narrow bays, which could have increased by the tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as “abundant” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been cut off.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims had been found locked under the care of broken buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho informed that the number of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongal, which is near the epicenter of earthquakes.
According to him, the communication was "exclusively protected without any information" from the Dongilla.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and he added that his workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse," the statement says.
On Saturday, the Agency received considerable criticism because it did not inform Paul that it had hit the waves with tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On amateur tapes shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of the building with a desperate scream warns people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes of the coast, the water wall will strike, which refers to buildings and cars.
Agency Reuters was not able to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and wave of tsunamis caused a major accident in the electricity sector that interrupted communication around Paul, so the authorities could only co-ordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes using Jakarty and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport was reopened only to help transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donganda arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from all over the office building, they saw the images of the events on their way, said Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief teams started a sad disaster relief effort, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to join Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and staff from abroad may begin to take place instead of the Kalamati until the national disaster zone is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," says a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
“As the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When Paul was born the second night after the earthquake and tsunamis, friends and relatives of those who are still not religious, they still hoped that their love would be the miracles that put off the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled out of the little boy's channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been in custody for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon explained how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the establishment of Roa Roa Hotel, he sent news via WhatsApp competitors from Pal, who participated in the beach festival.
His reports, however, ended with a gray mark instead of two blue inscriptions.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took 26 750 USD while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the news of the police department in Newport, on Friday, the thieves cut off 26 750 USD of Brink's employees in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was prepared to put another money in it.
When he did, another man "runs out behind the Brink's employee" and stole a money-scattered bag that was supposed to be put into the ATM.
According to the press reports, several suspects were seen from the scene, but the police did not clarify the number of people involved in the incidents.
For any information about the identity of the suspect, please contact the police in Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "Bytost is formally known as Kanye West."
For 40 years West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and a pseudonym used as the name of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, he replaces the singer Arian Grande, who cancelled his participation for "citizenal reasons", as set out by the creator of the series.
The West has already said that the word for it has, in addition to the abbreviation of the existing professional name and religious significance.
"In my opinion, "yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where "you" means "you," the West heard the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with a loud moderator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
The former JAY-Z co-worker of the West also wrote in Wednesday with the associate and without him and the big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that "he will never use the army to lure the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 started shooting at people at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would lead young people to criminal gangs.
United States should double funding of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the United States should double the amount it imposes on research in this area.
The commentary comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published AI announcements, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has launched a plan to be a single in innovation AI by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far away from the USA and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in the CNBC interview that double funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery would be made in the USA.
Lee, who published his book "Supervelmancy AI: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order" this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face+.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system, which won the best American player in the game Othello, and later was a leading employee of Microsoft's research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous U.S. government technological competition, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"Academic peaks don't take China, but corporate," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employed in recent years by the best university experts to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help to change immigration policy.
“In my opinion, doctorate holders in AI should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
China's National Supply of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and the academic environment, and announced to the White House the creation of the Election Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million annually in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not been able to do anything for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the 'North Macedonia Republic', which would resolve an old dispute with Greece for decades, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has the province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory, and has therefore vetted Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded a new name proposed in June, but nationalist opposition claims that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the boycott raised doubts as to whether he would deliver at least 50 per cent of his wishes to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the coming agreement with Greece?"
The guests of the change of name, including the president of the Zoran Zaeva government, claim that it is the price that is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to enter the organisation such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not mandatory, enough Members said that they would be guided by the result of the vote.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
The vote, however, was only 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally gave their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old volunteer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, deliver their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumika, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and removes chairs from the positions of the people who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head-on, not a door for the service," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring about Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 %, such a necessary investment.
"I think that a large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could be attended between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that on Sunday it was planned to vote 57 per cent of respondents.
Of these, 70% indicated that they would choose yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one wishes.
The failure of the rapporteur would have meant the first serious breach of the Western government's policy since its appearance last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for the goal through the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a defense to Brighton on Saturday, and thus secured Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguera, his goal seemed ridiculously easy at 65 minutes.
It all started with a recording that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinkled between three Brighton defenders and got to the open space.
Aguera then wrapped four green clothes.
On the edge of Brighton's punitive territory, he hung one of the defenders and took a few more steps.
The next recording on the left found Sterling.
The English attacker joined the ball in the puddle area back to Aguere, which turned the barricade Briggton Mathew Ryan into the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," the reporters announced to the manager of City Pep Guardiola.
"We said it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to go naked at the moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this game is Primer League, but Sterling has been set up.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in the area of Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
The dream was working the ball, and then he sent Sterling to a remote spot.
Sky Blues attacker locked the ball into the net just before he crashed outside the game.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to lose the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were cut off from the game-off fight, there were not many reasons to replay.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday, he will stand up for the speaker in the fight against Colorado Rockies – however only when they have Rockies, who lead the NL West on one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
Rockies secured their first title in the division on Friday night with at least a wild card winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can start at least because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will be playing with the greatest effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn't I play in it?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but allegedly withdraws from the Scherzer situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
In this season, Washington's headmaster has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 changes.
Trump attended a meeting in West Virginia
The President spoke directly about the situation around his candidate to the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term election.
“There will be everything we have proved in November.
In one of the most important choices in our lives, there are five weeks left.
It's one of the big, big ones – I don't mind, but we're still moving and fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take over the power by any means you need, you see here vanity, resistance.
They don't care who gets hurt, who needs to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats have decided on "responsibility and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "enragment and evil and resistance and propaganda."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate judicial commission, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which led to a loud suffrage of obstetricity.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you make that document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, wait – it was really the wrong word of the body – the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a varied voice stream.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions
When the Momenta activists in my local side voted for my memoirs, there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who said they were not welcome – because they were honest about their opinion.
My colleagues from the parliament, Joan Ryan, treated the same way, because she firmly established anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policies, as regards national security, as regards Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on the Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was written that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a member of the local parliament on the Labour Party, the GC meeting was exactly like that on Friday night.
Unfortunately, most of today's meetings do not last, and the promises of "more loving, more powerful" politics have long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is considered acceptable to the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. My colleagues, whom I had previously thought to have similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stop the position I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and no matter what I say – then the tyranny follows on social networks, where they call for my resignation, they condemn the middle politics, and they tell me that I should not be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face each day a wave of sesistical or racist attacks, but they will never stop.
One aspect of this era of politics, of which I am most disappointed, is how the abuses become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the varied voice stream and with every proposal for expressing mistrust or changing the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, they have been working many times to keep me back, not to be so shy, and then I will be "well".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the poor government of Margaret Thatcher, who has let my class of general schools literally break down, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as local councillor or government minister.
I've never been hiding my policy in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would just say that if the country passes to Brexit, which will damage the homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not intended for Momento in Nottingham, but for my loved ones, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of you all.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undetected Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fives drew a bit of a final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful fun game Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're in the front of the table as the only failure.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the odds that helped home to win, and Peter Murchie's watch had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have been through great trials and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "All the honors of Ayr, they got the chance better than us."
The fifth Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, changed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr ahead, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, whom Warriors released for the match, enabled Melrose to use computational exercises and Jason Baggot won an unchanged five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr with the penalty and then scored precisely in half time and changed his solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson, changed by Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a further delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the sidewalk, and when he started playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, which Climo changed.
Deputy Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again used players in addition thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvins after a short strong pressure.
The housekeepers returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow for the attack of Clima without a ball, MacPherson of the penal order put the ball behind the running little Ayr.
Climo changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth of his household.
Star Still Game starts a new career in the hostel
It seems that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the area of hospitality. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 16-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvise in a popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with a long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming nine series will be the final series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement from the Official Journal, Afringingmorn Limited is the Director.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun's journal indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "promotional business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors are watching the La Paz Marine Command, which is designed by the Lanov.
Above the public buildings is a blue flag in the colour of the ocean.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
Getting him is our duty."
Throughout the interior of Bolivia, there is still a living memory on the coast, which the country lost in the benefit of Chile in the bloody war of the 19th century – as well as the desire to relaunch the Pacific.
These desires may be greater than a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1st after five years of detention.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive outcome," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow MSD's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of interrupted talks – Chile must act on Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
Charisma native president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial fight to re-election next year – is also very interested in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia – and even if that happened, it would not change much.
This United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign a Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments have been made shows that the case has not been "complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, not only did they support Bolivia’s cause, but they may even have offended her.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the current Bolivian government," Zárate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
The disease and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to conduct a discussion.
Both countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the view that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
On Monday he will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – as a political barrier to the sea.
"The pain never surrenders its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless the United States can believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation never weapons their nuclear weapons as the first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made to the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the minister seems to be foreign to the United States Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has tied to the dead point, more than three months for Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is "planut hope", that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on its knees.
Washington is careful about agreeing with the declaration if Pchjongang does not take significant steps to defend itself at first.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, the general skepticism is that Pchjongang thinks he is serious about rejecting this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris reviews show that your fashion shops will soon reach the latest trend of huge head coverings
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely lock the sun, your search is at the end.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of broken huge head coverings for their summer/year 2019 collection on a survey that caught everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer sailed Instagram and these designers sent to the mill their exciting creations.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was an overcrowded beech hat with a broad edge reminding the feathers, which swam the heads of the models.
Other excessive supplements were refined melons, magic hats and even pineapples – but they are not meant to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and in time at Halloween.
Many of the pestro-colored masks have their lips covered and remember Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One production recalled the heating equipment with both snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a grain of scattered ice.
And if you're going to continue with the huge mode, you're lucky.
Modern experts predict that huge caps could even reach fashion stores.
The adult hats come after "La Bomba", a half-metre straw with a wide cremation worn by all from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind this very impractical hat, which sailed the social media, sent another huge creation to the observation mill – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in the swimsuits that carry it.
The dark orange rafi bag removed by rafi's trimmings and measured white-haired handling was on the Paris week fashion exhibition piece collection La Riviera jaro/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
The Stylist Celebrate Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next year – given that the designer had so much success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and it continues to produce other excellent results in 2018. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only foster this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and is trying to ensure the best level of service for its students and parents.
Independent schools are preparing their students for another and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place for global citizens.
As a sector of education, which can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and requested in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person with a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that languages are at the top of the tables, with no higher success rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language achieved the best marks A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest score A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects that students choose are as important in the study plans of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons which employers pose as problems in the provision of vacancies, 17% of language skills are insufficient.
Hence, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
If a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a lifelong ability.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries, people speak more languages automatically to benefit from competition.
According to a survey organised by YouGov in 2013 by 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them failed to speak in a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 %, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages that develop economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland is different from what languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others are teaching languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the child is interested in, he will always have at independent schools to choose from a number of languages with teachers who are in the field of expertise.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the educational environment that children are preparing and equipping is the skills needed to succeed, whatever lies ahead.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and significance.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will play the first show on Sunday in San Diego in Lakers
Fans who look forward to LeBron James's first date for Los Angeles Lakers are waiting soon.
The coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening match predicted in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton reported on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James probably plays only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the training James asked for his plans for six Lakers matches in the pre-season.
"At this stage, I don't need a pre-accession struggle," he said.
Trump's show in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, launches a wave show in the campaign.
It's the first of the five myths planned for next week, including a stop in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as the Republics stand in November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
How many hours does Trump's show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 east time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's holder in West Virginia you can watch online below through live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which passed this week and was very tense about the accusation of inappropriate sexual behaviour. It is expected that the confirmation of the Senate's vote will be postponed in a week before the FBI's investigation is carried out.
But the main objective of this freedom of worship is to help the Republicans to get the pace ahead of the November elections.
According to agency Reuters, campaign organizers of President Trump say that these five meetings next week are aimed at "adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the Snow House".
"The control of the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go to the most States in this Russian season," said Reuters spokesman Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
According to a West Virginia Metro News station, the supporters of "Ohia and Pennsylvania could follow the media from Pittsburgh" at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
This will be the second time on Saturday in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the investigation.
“For Morriseye, it’s not a good sign that the president has to accept to help him in his research,” says Reuters Politologist at the University of Zapadovirgin, Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team showed that the stomach has to fight to keep hopes before Sunday alone
After three one-sided matches, the two Saturdays can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The hopeful quay is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all, in such competitions.
So where's the frog going to break up now?
"They've said six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so it's probably moving a little toward us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, leads four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in their shells, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the shape of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and everyone can boast of three points of four.
Speeth was dying when he moved from the shelter to the green and went as an example.
The famous screams were still on his lap, when he managed the key pad to win the whole game when they were with Thomas in two jackets on two backs.
His route, which won them a 15-pack match, met with a similar rhyme that tells you the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that each of these players left.
18 pens for leaving the trail.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakably main story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but beautiful two from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only two who didn't hit the cave on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This course and the way in which energy flows towards the stormy audience, confirms from it that these are players for Sunday victory, and that in the West of the Sun over Le Golf National will not be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best both at the same time on a different jacket.
However, the words about European fame remain early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had recently collaborated with Serge Garcia, the hero of the early games with four cats when he was cooked with Alex Noren.
The ham and two grapes on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in a waste that they had not escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
The games two to two balls are so fascinating when you're closely following people's interactions in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team, and the last day has been a major leap, but this two-legged game has also shown that the US team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
Until the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with score 10-6 points
Europe has gained a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup after the two-ball games on Saturday came out with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the rival Tiger Woods, decided to make four shots in Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the two-ball games with the American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but could not reach the deficit.
Page Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who have received the nickname "Mollwood" after the season, are just the second couple who won four points from their four initial games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating the players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then the hungry beat tired Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance highlights, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game two to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who started two ball games in the morning, returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in the game two to the 2&1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - one and three in the world score.
Europe, however, did not have this pleasant new day in the south-west of Paris saved in the whole range.
Three-person top winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raced two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a double game, although two first jackets lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from a four-point deficit to two, although as a defending party, Fury needs only a restriction to get a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it appears that there is a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that "in no case" is not armed unilaterally and without trust
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued sanctions of the United Nations have deepened their confidence in the United States and, under such circumstances, the country will never surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual meeting that North Korea had adopted in the past year "extensive measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promises that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be expanded.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, trust in our national security will not be found and, under such circumstances, it is not possible to defend itself unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "problem" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization simply because Pchjongang has already passed in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on the "denoclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea strives for a formal end to the war conflict from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pchjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the challenge of releasing hard international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US continues to ‘denoclearisation of the first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to use its objectives and even object to ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“I feel that the sanctions can bring us to our knees, are people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If this issue of denuclearization were on the side of South Korea and not the United States, the denouclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a pitiful situation."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was dramaticly different from that of last year when he told the United Nations meeting that the North Korean missile target on the US territory was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump named Kim as "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Trump, which in last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, Kim praised for his courage to take steps to combat it, but said that much work and sanctions must still be carried out until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reimburse Pchjongang for the measures taken.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United States Mike Pompeo, however, informed the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The continuation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and uninterrupted until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearisation"
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to support the financing of the Pchjongang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at an official UN meeting and Pompeo announced that next month he would visit Pchjongang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left from Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, only to inform North Korea about him over several hours that he had met "gangster requirements".
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile area and also the nuclear complex if the United States adopts the "relevant measures".
He stated that Kim informed him that the "relevant measures", in which he hoped, were security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard with a participating course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has brought all its students to more sleep, and in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies throughout the night when students do not sleep and are excited about caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most demanding university are often unemployed when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is believed to be the first species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after he reported on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains basic information to students about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to take a course after finding that the students were really not asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges, where students click on the cupboards with coffee, locks, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In the other part, participants are informed how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep also grows.
The supply of good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, exhaustion and hardship, he said - even so that it does not prevent recovery, because sleep depriving the brain to starve, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to propose a course that he graduated from one of his classes in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
He hopes that by next step he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
The professor recommended to the students to consider the setting of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can determine your Circadian rhythm, leading to problems with shade.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga drowned Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy tried to determine Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox site tried to record its first victory from February 4th to February 1st on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave its post eight points from the leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers composition seemed uninhibited and determined to settle.
While Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston leans on the third and immediately behind the Hibernian team in a single branch.
And it could come to the other problems of Rangers after what had to be the magic judge Calum Spence treated with head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which she moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be pleased to see how his well-trained skill had moved his opponent on every step.
The Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingstone did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's market, but the hostage buried his big chance.
A far-off team of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third, there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless met, but Judge Steven Thomson put the Colombian challenge out of the table.
The Rangers managed only two targets in the first half, but the ex-braker Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening after 34 minutes could have been against running the game, no one can deny they've earned it for the door already.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was in peace and took Meng to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the stop and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost instant outcome when the wing was stuck to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was fighting off the line and the attack was blocking.
But Livingstone continued to lure visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgov and Halket metal one long ball after the other.
Holt's party could have deepened its momentum in the final stages, but McGregor was well placed to block Jacobs before Lithuania got out of the corner.
The deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed charge of punishment when he was wrong with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Found Geiger's readers
And now a page from our German "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still arrives... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter became a pop culture at the time, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is this God?”
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these hearings on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans said, "Well, now he's really in it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But finding out what his name is, he's still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their conversion to the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein, which is common to many cancers, and then use re-injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches an immune system to recognise dangerous cells had cancer of the ovaries for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their metabolism in the laboratory, so they can "see" the common protein in many cancers called HER2 and then be applied to the cell again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancers, ova, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” was to focus on cancer cells, was already involved in leukemia treatment.
Kanye West participated in a pro-trump sermon, in his magga capi, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was released in a study on Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which President Donald Trump praised the US and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he had on himself the hat of Make America Great Again, he began swimming on the democracies and reiterated his support of President Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I were to drive me into racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star was making fun of Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on the appeal of the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's theatrical talks were recorded on social media by the comicist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West also complained to the viewers that he had a good diet in the back of his head.
"In the back of my body, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
That's crazy!
They also said I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only served the public shouting twice and the SNL members looked humiliated, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio is completely quiet."
West was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West fooled many present by singing song I Love dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the leading conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most serious characters: DECKU, ZE SES POSTAVIL DAVU."
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that the West "was just who he is, and it's absolutely amazing."
“But I DON’T RETURN someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “artificial”), whom I believe to be representing and sending to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and go in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dogg, was first named Snoop Lion and, of course, the musical legend of the Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as the Prince.

The game Thrones star Kit Harington went into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
Herec, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be hard to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the age #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to his star of the Rose Leslie throne, also admitted that he was “very strong” to this problem.
"At this moment, I personally feel, quite strongly - what has become so bad with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenagers about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood due to its very male character.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, grow up feeling that every man needs to have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?

HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, this virus affects more than 820,000 people.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which meant a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread over some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese health professionals have introduced at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, the studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are ultimately treated as women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that staff would have avoided the data of the GOP senators, the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, US MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican American senators to the law firm.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charge was supported by "scientists" and websites.
"False, false and other reprehensible lies," Watersová said in his Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included the addresses of home and telephone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared on Thursday on the internet and published an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's discussion on the charges of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
There were times after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is connected to the Waters office and has published information about the members of the Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the failure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flescher.
"This rejection is angry," Flescher wrote.
"This means that it has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
It can't be horizontal.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
It has to be calm and do not interrupt."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed to be too angry during the quarter hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the creditors are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English again contains reviews – weaker espionage parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which also seems to be the case of Johnny English's recovery in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire be on the subject of how clearly bad we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this enchanted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things in a completely new way - the name of more than anything else that is a wide comic design designed for non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on glamorous glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean's point and a big cousin of the guy who sang the only tone in the character of Chariots of Fire at the Celebration of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
The post is also originally based on the traveller and the international secret man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials and who left chaos behind.
In this last edition, the JE has one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the chopper in the middle of the skull, and the rotor hats had a short look at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely overwhelming, especially when the "series" film brands like 007 and Mission Ne are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being designed for children than adults, and for me, the crazy trampoons of Johnny English are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's quiet movie gagas in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister, who is a pumping and busy attitude that is already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularism: Emma Thompson's favorite Theresa May attitude is the best, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs inform her that once each of her active spies is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English, who is now employed as director of some luxury equipment, is also giving a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of nice gagas, because English offers a Spanish Academy similar to the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall because of the emergency brigade and met with his former long-term sufferer, Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the basement, an affected character on which Vicki Pepperdine may even have a little swim.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for her Majesty's secret services, and they meet a beautiful woman named Opheli Ballet, who played Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subjected to the charismatic technological billionaire's spell, who claims to be able to resolve British computer crimes: the felony Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their cleavage full of fried potatoes: masking as a waiter burns a French restaurant; creates chaos when they crash on board Volt's luxury yachts; and English launches clean anarchy when they try to meet the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly prepared for this last sequence, but if it's even more kind and fuzzy, it has something on the children's TV.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop an English plan to work for four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to hand over to employees savings resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy the weekend - but they would still get the same reward.
The sources claim that this idea would be "turned" into the economic agenda of the party and plan to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
The four-week shift was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use the changing economies.
A long - term worker for Sunday Times stated: “The assessment of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that falls into the position of the party to export the economy to the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has pledged a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spoke: "The four-week work week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "knowers" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies do not have to return to their total share, because the Labour Government could carry out "cut-offs" on the basis of the alleged commission.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the company's management board and to create own funds that transfer 10 % of own funds of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to a maximum of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in a series of "60 minutes", whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the finding of the office could lure some Republican senators into seeking their support.
In a conversation on Sunday '60 minutes', the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I called him when it happened that the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, firm."
However , the Graham decision is irrevocable .
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would mean a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly opposed it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those who were named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will perform every year's music event, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally active mission at the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain free admission to the action (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP entry), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, telephone or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert in a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that by signing online petitions or sending a tweet, something will change?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from his beneficiaries, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the world’s leaders’ announcement of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which will affect lives by 2030, more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds are currently directly affecting nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realists who committed to "help children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwand $35 million to help end the sub-commissioning in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, as you are, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of a subjugation in history," the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said a gift during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions called for by the U.K. to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will attract 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your web site with a question, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
“ It’s going to be a long and hard journey, ” the Global Quote replied, “sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil law and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is among those who will be hosting Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman this year in New York.
The United States could use the Navy for "blocking", which would defend Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may "if necessary" withdraw to the sea to prevent the entry of Russian energy into the markets, including the Middle East, the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is working to invite the legitimate government - is a commitment to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to provide energy just as much as in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this opportunity to use our shipping system to ensure that sea routes are open and, where necessary, blocked, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the action organised by the Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that in the United States is called "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach and conversation with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more investment in or replacement of fuel," he said, and at the same time he refers to Russia as a "single" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its fuelled natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which for European consumers is much cheaper.
For this purpose, the officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "unsatisfied" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made from Berlin's "handset" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion meters of circulars, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure development tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. took an interest in Germany's position, which once again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "be close to looking" at the presidential candidacy in 2020," says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, "a close look" at the presidential candidacy.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women's position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will be close to the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that "this country is heading in the wrong direction".
"I'm afraid of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in his criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said: "Of course we need an FBI poll before the vote."
However, the questionnaire published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's wishes do not think they should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" volunteers from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for the candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Another highly-established democratic name, which was mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020, is former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina at the meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be related to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little different, return to healing, return and wonder if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and the flight, and every other member of the army is giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla in Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, arresting the report of domestic violence and holding arms in custody, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighty States and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US government that attacks asylum victims with gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of the eighteen states and the period Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and to question this measure, the NBC stated.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case, which in August gave the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal politics was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his sons and violent gang members" abused her, but the US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing all kinds of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has reversed the decision of the removal Senate for immigrants from 2014 which has enabled illegal immigrants who suffer domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of D.C. stated in his statement on Friday that the new measure "ignores the decade of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further said that the policy that supports immigrants' entry is damaging to the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they will "give the necessary work".
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration, so that they no longer share asylum with victims in June, who are victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assil is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Zupala rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has already doubled, race in search of survivors over time
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who enjoyed her hot boy at the evacuation center in the ravaged town of Pal.
"Every minute the healer will bring other bodies.
Clear water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, choosing through the stuff they were soaked up and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Two Haris, who had suffered a fracture in their spine and shoulders, were at Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the continuing severe subsequent shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake had swept his hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been pushed into the wall," Harris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife called for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "schiking" propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the US journal, which focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid supplement to China Daily in the Register of Des Moines - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to blend into US congress elections in the US on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to get involved in the American elections indicated what American representatives said was a new phase of escalating campaigns by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place commercials in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the escalating trade war, which occurs at the level of each other's imports.
China's legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were proposed so that exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican side, were attacked by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now duplicates this joke by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“Despite that, in a newspaper station on the Beijing Street, you will find limited inconsistencies and you will not see any real reflection of the inconsistent views that China might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that “one of the most important Chinese news has refused to publish the offer” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans leave their wills in front of the elections because of the debate with Kavanaugh, warns analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanau, who faces several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the upcoming elections in the middle of the period, they are aware of the response, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was last time trying to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and speaker of the MoveOn progressive group, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors were protesting "Listofad is approaching!" at a demonstration in the Senate hall, where the Republicans who are concerned with the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugha, even through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will market records," said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
"People say it was high already, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among women's prominent voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing her charge of sexual assault on the candidates of the highest court, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed, they could follow resistance.
"It was a messy mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in committee or about final voting, nor about whether Kavanaugh is sitting on the table, it’s also about how the Republicans managed and dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. Priority Director, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed to the reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with some more sympathies for the second named.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claimed that they were probably or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake's FBI currently investigates the charges brought by Ford, as did at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate judicial committee under oath last week that she was attacked by a drunk by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
Founder of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web inventor, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source Platform of Berners-Lee named Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was "the world power."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional on the personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personally strengthened by data".
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce's CEO, to bring the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated with the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google don’t talk about making a complete change, where all their business models are turned up at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his contribution to the media published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy who received Victorian Cross during World War I
The celebrations have been held for years since the only spiritual Anglican church was won during the first world war of the Victorian cross as a warrior.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglier and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never knew that he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons discovered a memorial stone on Saturday at the birth of a celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "generally symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense silence and a strong shooting from the poles and towers."
Later, he got to the first line and with the "most courage" led the line forward before he threw himself into the fire field and knocked three separate units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I'd never been able to do, but at the same time something that's humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a survey conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they put in a wedding.
Michael Vann said that “he felt a great honor to be able to share in the tour”, and added that“the courage of the true hero is shown by the support he gives to many people.”
MMA fans stayed all night to track Bellator 206, instead get Peppa pig
Imagine waiting all night for you to follow the inflated Bellator 206, just to resist the main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts, took place in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a mutual match, the audience in the United Kingdom was amazed when the news turned into a series of pepp pigs.
Some remained unresolved after they had been in the early hours of battle.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in sending to order for children as "a true form of bad joke."
“In accordance with the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, and it is therefore necessary to send children’s order,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked for this transfer.
"Peppa Prasatko", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program in order to be involved and spectators in the future in Britain.
"I think that when I think about sending, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went back and forth and not all were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was for the government.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're reducing it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to keep the promise to the fans and it didn't work out.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "major" because of sexuality
The Tom Daley Olympic jump in the water says he grew up with a sense of minorities over all because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not all are like him."
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, who introduced Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give other "hope."
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
The regular moderator of the long-term Kirsty Young had several months free of disease.
Daley, who appeared to be a triad in Lavern's first program, stated that he felt "lesser" than anyone else who grew up with him, because "there was no social unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, "So far, these feelings of minority and different real things have given me strength and power to do so."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, said not to disappoint anyone who might have found out what it was like with his sexuality.
The double holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a fighter for the right to move LGBT with a high profile and took advantage of his presence at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to add "hope".
This three-person world champion stated that loving him to a man – American film director Dustin Lance Blacka, whom he met in 2013 – “has shut down the unprepared.”
Daley, who was 20 years older, took over last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young, he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer,” he said, “it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
Two of them adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June and Daley said that he had "changed the whole angle of view".
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in style "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't want to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home in the Olympic Games, I don’t know a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first warehouse – the Spring of Heather Small – which reasoned with him at the start of the Olympics and still called for skin cough.
The Desert Island Disks series is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson, who was out of shape, ended up on Saturday at Ryder Cup on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, Ryder Cup, but he would have to issue a form to prevent that it was an unfortunate milestone.
Mikkelsson, who played for events every two years on a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often as it was in the United States, he spent his five-year-old master's day between cheerleaders and work at the game in a row that he hoped would fix what he had.
This 48-year-old player was never the closest one to the drivers, and it wasn't at the top of his career, so it's not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where the long-term member field routinely punishs the wrong shots.
And if the golf course is not quite worrying about itself, Mikkelson is facing the British Open Francesc Molinari, which won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood's new team.
If the Americans, who had four less points, had started 12 solo matches, avoided a quick performance, Mikkelson's sword could prove to be absolutely fundamental.
Fury expressed his trust in his husband and gave nothing else.
"Just understand the role that he had today, hit me behind his back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“They believe so much.
He's a member of the Sino Slums, and in the past week he's been so beneficial to these teams.
I guess I didn't get to imagine he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most of Ryder Cup's West on Sunday.
This could mean the end of Ryder Cup's career, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven remixes, even though Fury says that his presence with the team has brought some unbearable results.
"He's fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun when they followed him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience, knows that a large lead towards singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane started a match in 1997 in Valderram, where a company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point jump over the Americans, but to the goal line they got a very close victory 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderram, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only closely,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when in 2018 they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So the stories and every member of this team showed me that it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be completely bored.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all those points are on the table.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to get this trophy, and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with his players leading the complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
We'll have a different animal tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're going to be there for yourself, your golfer's capacity is fully checked.
It's a message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best of you too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Fury will take care of his players to play better as individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Fury was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up as a defeated when Europe reached the 'Medina Star'.
"I remember every damn word," answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to focus on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a significant pressure on the middle struggles.
According to this, we set up a structure and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and to build Rory McIlroy in the final match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I went with the group of boys in this series because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship is still suspended
The latest German maritime frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one year for faulty systems and snowy coasts, local media have introduced.
According to the Die Zeit, the leader of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ class of Baden-Wuerttemberg, was now seconded to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to become part of the shipping industry in 2014, but the major problems with the delivery of this ambitious project were ignored.
As a replacement for the old fractal class Bremen will serve four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an effective work, a number of anti-flight and anti-fouling ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another important feature is the long maintenance period – it should be possible to install the latest frigates up to two years outside the home port.
However, continuous delays mean that the peak seaships – which were supposed to enable Germany to send forces to the sea – will be introduced into operation by the time they are old, notes Die Zeit.
The famous F125 frigate was released last year when the German Navy officially refused to introduce the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss fleet in Hamburg.
That was the first time the ship was returned by the ship manufacturer after the shipment.
It was only a little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of key "software errors and interferences with the metal elements" of the race, which would make the warship useless when fighting.
The design of the software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on Bremen’s frigates.
It has also shown that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of shipping to add future innovation.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal elements, the problem is also the cost of the whole project – including crew training.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price has risen to EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates were particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the naval forces are indeed "coming a ship capable of landing."
This representative pointed out that the problems had been over and over again because the old ships had been removed from operation, but no replacements had been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class's frigates are capable of becoming part of the shipping equipment.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out on the site of bats at the Scottish Highlands, aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
There is hope that finding research will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study carried out by the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the nebula of the stars and the smallest and narrow long and watery in the Botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas in this non-performing site, which will monitor the activities of non-performing during the entire annual period.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calling bats and what individual species are doing.
The following will be issued a map of the habitat and a message that will create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show what habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of a hole, and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The unpopular population in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom in the last century are largely dying.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting the colony and the natural environment.
The risk may also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as a trap on the muscles and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than eyes when hunting.
They use an innovative echo-location technique to highlight the fractures and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony controls, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even arranged the first and only outstanding non-citizenal reservation in the residence of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of non-citizens in Scotland.
The manager at David Thompson's headquarters says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need for survival."
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before the start of maintenance work in the properties, as it is possible that an unconscious destruction of a single mother nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and they are unlawful to kill them, to burden, to destroy or destroy their colony.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said: "We do not know how their people are treated, nor do we know how they are treated."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers are about to complain about the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out the charge of rape for "false news" and stated that people want to "see" using his name.
His lawyers are going to complain to the German journalist Der Spiegel, who informed of these accusations.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of rape by U.S. Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, she paid $375 000 to inform Der Spiegel on Friday about the case.
A few hours after the publication of the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and identified information as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-person rating holder Golden Ball in the camera.
"They want to live on my behalf.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to the Agency Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to complain about Der Spiegel's unsubstantiated accusations, which they have identified as "inadmissible notification of suspicion in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will claim compensation for “moral damage to the extent of the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of the past.”
The alleged incident was to occur in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel apartment and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After the night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the game, where, according to the documentation given by the court in the Clark County District Court district in Nevada, he had been raped by analytics.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo has collapsed after the alleged incident and told her that he was disappointed at "99 per cent" and "one per cent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and left her photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed with extrajudicial arrangements because "she was afraid of kidnapping" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to restore the proceedings, because she is still traumatized by a reported incident.
Ronalda at the time of the charge of the strike from the break to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he bought a famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "will always be sorry", if after Brexit it comes to its world leader's status in the manufacture of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark has been appointed.
He added that it is "anxious", that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnston race, not far from Derby.
"A deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car stated that the impact of delays on borders in the absence of a Brexit agreement could be a job.
In a race in Burnston, where the cars Auris and Avensis brand Toyota are produced, almost 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, of which 90% were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain had suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have noticed the stoppage of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, indicates that it will close its race for the production of Mini cars in Oxford right after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers identify as a risk for the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of the supply of "right of time", and parts of the suppliers in the UK and the EU are supplied for cars produced on order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could be disrupted at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire race in stock, the company introduced, and this would result in a stopover of production.
Mr Clark pointed out that Theresy May's plans for the recovery of future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated so as not to miss out on these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the current success, but also the understanding of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the costs added would reduce the competitiveness of the race and, finally, even at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnston race for 24 years and is chairman of the competition, stated that the members of the committee organisations are still more concerned: “I have experience that once these places are gone, they will never return.
The Speech Government said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, leads to the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "at next week removed", as he continues to fight for the position of the Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein comes to the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which examines the Russian elections, the links between Trump's supporters and Russia, and the possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Let the Trump release the representative general power and thus threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's collapses for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein was discussing the recording of the camera to record the conversation with Trump and the possibility of the President's meeting by way of Supplement 25.
Rosenstein's message has been rejected.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House, surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said Rosenstein wouldn't "be better", but then the meeting was delayed so that she wouldn't be heard by the Senate's judicial committee, where they gave witness statements to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate a weekly indictment against Kavanaugh, and the Senate's full vote was delayed.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox channel reports on Sunday.
The question at the meeting with Rosenstein answered: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, perhaps it will be necessary to move for the next week in view of all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always tell the media the current information."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not arranged a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences had been subjected to an opinion on TV reporters, even though she said, "I do not agree with the fact that they are going out."
She subsequently proposed that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President arranges more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving any evidence. "We looked at these numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press representatives were able to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying it, and you've seen that we've been doing it in the last few weeks, and that there's a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or with open sessions or press conferences with visiting high representatives.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre view of the assembled reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to worry about Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter not even six months before the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the request for the status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the years, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continue to lag behind, and they focus on the expected decision this year in the autumn.
However, the British Government also takes steps to prepare a possible deviation scenario without an agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, despite this, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our womanly desire is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tiggers removed from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie sent an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury on Saturday 31-27 by the opponent Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before midnight.
"He came to the side-car and he was just digging up there," Reed said.
The coaches and health professionals put Abercrombie on the sideline of the oxygen and then put it on the nose and prepared for further evaluations.
A State official from Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had committed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information on the type/range of the injury" is available so far and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, graduated from the first season for Tennessee post-transmission from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total moves, which means a total of 18 moves in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, and money will also be used to help homeless people in the context of new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's knowledge, whose aim is to attract young voters
An increase in the obligation of higher real estate tax will be payable to persons who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
An increase of £120 million per year is expected – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay higher rent tax when they buy their property in the United Kingdom, and the money will also be used to help people without a home, Today Theresa Mayová will announce.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success in attracting young people with a duty to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in property tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless sleep over the head.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay the rent tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and purchase for rent, may reach up to three per cent.
It is assumed that the State funds will increase to £120 million per year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of the citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which saves prices and makes it easier for those who buy the first to get to the ladder of the house.
Many of the rich areas of the country – especially in the capital city – have become “the cities of spirits” just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up the land, but not using it, and urged Mrs Mayo to draw quotas from the price-accessible homes to correct the "near home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rental management and termination of "unsafety" removals.
He also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Ms. Mayová stated: “I said last year that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream – that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it can't be right to make it easy for non-British and foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working residents of the United Kingdom.
For many people dream of their own home too far and a dove sleep without a roof over her head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross points out that his "highest ambition" is to become the Scottish manager at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after he brought St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B value, and that was it," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that's gonna pull me back.
But such an opportunity would come only if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any discomfort from the consequences of such names introduced in such a big club when he previously rejected the prejudices from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“A success would be measured for me at that time if I could get this club back to Prime Minister League.
The structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belong to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I guess I'd be successful unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has been a career in the leadership for only three years, he previously served as an assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from the third group and transform St Mirren from the beginning of the defeat of the title of the champions right away in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than ever had in his career players in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
"They were probably real crusades," recalls the time when Alloa was taken away.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good, and using proper heights.
But the game can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to spend a week.
I'm still going through them from the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling in management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I've been feeling the most in my adult life."

Research found that a great time on the paint is Saturday at 17:30
The summer rain increased the revenues of British households facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that the groups of households and bars recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent in July – but the revenues of the restaurant decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA’s consulting company, who produced final reports, stated: “The stable sunflower and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that June followed a similar pattern as previous June, when the attendance of the house increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decrease in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June was even worse in July.
The houses and bars that were boiling on the drinks have so far been as strong as the restaurants have become worse.
Houses whose main markets are from food also endured the sun, although not as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent fell."
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure activities and hospitality, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of April.
The slowdown and the impact of significant social or sports activities are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chain continues to fight, although the annual decrease in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of current pressures on costs.

Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 pupils in high school showed an increase in "false instagram pages"
Reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students have found that they have a “main” account their parents know about
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, creates accounts in social networks that lie in front of his parents.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in high school showed a rapid increase in "false instagram accounts", where photographs are shared.
Reports show concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students have found that they have a distorted “main” account that parents know about and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who visited her 13-year-old daughter's secret web found that her baby girl was trying to get others "to rape them."
Research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and educators cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most rated light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in sport as those who will benefit from her long-lasting experience at the international level in the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that it will be a great benefit for the athlete in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I will be truly successful and that I will help to drive sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it'd only be time to see if I'd get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to heal myself, I've learned to walk again, and I can practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Disposal of milk triggering comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company dealing with the production of the dispenser divided the online opinion of the advertising that compares the waving mothers to the lower cows.
In the context of the introduction of "the first silent portable transmitters in the world", Envi produced a music video with an emphasis on the freedom that the new transmitter gives to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the text: "Yes, I feel, but you don't see any glasses" and "In case you don't notice that I'm not pregnant, my chest is here."
The congregation continues: “Push, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
The advertisement, which was published on the company facebook page, has, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them indicated that it sheds light on the "hordes" of the dairy industry.
‘It is a very poor decision to abuse the advertising cows for this product.
Like us, it must be pregnant and given birth so that they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," one of the comments said.
Elvie dispenser is discreetly attached to the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Punctually traumatic for the mother and child.
But yeah, why don't you just use it to get an ad on the breast pump for the mothers who leave their kids?"
Someone else added, "That advertisement is completely out."
They also found out who defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that the composition was considered "infectious".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I kept kicking.
I feel exactly like a cow when I'm being sent.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's a matter of fact.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who waste their milk (often at work or at toilet) and feel like “cows”.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to excite or contaminate the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they all dance with discreet resellers hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the observation that many women who give up their milk indicate that they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no wires and has no hats and is beautifully hidden into the breast on the breast, so gives women freedom of movement, the ability to keep the child and even walk when moving.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for her mother, added: “Elvie is so revolutionary a product that she deserves a strong and provocative market introduction.
By creating parallels between pregnant mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point to the sending of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new dispenser will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's consignee got sent out.
During the London weekly fashion, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared at the mill, who just used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have quietly moved to the state camp at the texa border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump's administration have made it easier to place children with follow-up.
Most of the accompanying immigrants were traditionally created without evidence that they were afraid of the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, confirmed to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of the escort of isolated minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue in their search," said Mr. Albence.
According to the asylum-seekers, the representatives of the Member States in an effort to process matters more quickly with regard to children have introduced new rules which will require some of them to be brought before the court until the month before the detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear through a call within a video conference instead of personally declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who do not have a warrant for assistance will be deported quickly.
As long as the child is in custody, the child is more likely to experience difficulties or depression, which may lead to the outbreaks of the flow or attempts to escape, the workers of asylum facilities are demanding and report from the system over the last few months.
Lawyers point out that these concerns have been raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is working, most likely not noticed, just because of the size of the facility.
They added that the transfer of children to the camp without the delivery of time spent in emotional preparation or disparagement with friends could lead to a trauma that many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that they should download immediately US, French and Turkish "occupational files"
During the general meeting of the United Nations, foreign minister Walid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the eight-year war in the country has already taken place.
The Moual, also a representative of the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "it will be imposed accordingly."
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," said the assembly.
Moual claimed that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over", killing more than 360 000 people since 2011 and millions more died about their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue in the "fighting in this holy battle until we save all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, mostly in schools of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting with President Bashar al-Assad, and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the field of war.
In issuing refugees, Moual declared that they had good conditions for returning and accused "some Western countries" of the "widening of nationwide concerns", which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have spoken to the international community and humanitarian organisation to ease these returns," he said.
"Police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a security belt in the last Idlib attack created an opportunity to move on in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, the Moual pointed out that the agreement has "clearly the deadlines" and expressed hope that the military move will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front with the Al-Qaeda bond, who will be "declared".
The Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to the design of a military constitution for Syria and the postponement of the elections will take place.
The Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "control of the existing institutions" and issued a warning before the entry into force.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the complaint and the preliminary scandals of his office as president did not end.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the stalking.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main broadcast time has doubled by more than 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen's agency and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased monitoring on cable television to 3.5 million following main night news.
"It's a game that people love, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designed Survival" series on the ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellova, an experienced comedy author and series “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to choose Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he's funny with him,' said Mrs. Scovellov.
It's the point of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that is being played in Washington could predict the future of Roe V. Wada, so that families of immigrants can reunite and benefit from the global economy.
Control is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged trackers.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen, following a six-hour panel of experts who discuss how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" source for his book "Fear," squeezing the leather band of Paul Manafort worth $15,000 (the "golden dress" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels' inadvertently portraying "anatomy".
Besides, I'm not going to look at Super Maria the same way.
“Part of what he does and what he causes to feel reality show is that he feeds you with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, leader of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document about the N.F.L. Trump series in which Kim Čong-una is rated).

He couldn't escape, not when Brett Kavanaugh set up a Senate judicial committee and the future of the highest court was in trouble.
"I remember when we did all those crazy things and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money outflows into the most narrow domestic competitions of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania, after a lively flow of finance, was created by the reorganization of the congresses, which generated two holders of the office in the battle against the same chair.
This recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburgh District into the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, which received another district in the special election last year in the spring.
Lamb stands against the other holder of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with a new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were permanently divided in favour of the Republics, there was a mapping.
The race started in the new 17th century by means of a financial gap between the financial elements of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th congressional district.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political experts give the democracies a little jump.
America Considers Encouraged Salvador to Support China, Then Drops Down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama, until the partners were court-married by the Trump team's organization team.
The representatives of the foreign ministries decided to withdraw the US leaders of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to know Tchaj-wan further," the speaker of Heather Nauertová stated in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered only against Salvador, which received US$ 140 million in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial aid and aimed at limiting visas, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of deaths of pain.
With continued internal negotiations, the North American and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity leading to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the leading executives explained that they wanted to continue in the negotiations and to effectively finish any consideration for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the resolution of the conference currently planned in mid-October, as part of the signal, which the board's management has launched.
And three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The White House speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed with the debate on internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to government executive and also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Study history
The report of Robert Mueller from a special committee on the possible prevention of Mr. Trump in the exercise of his right, which is now in the public records of many evidence, could be a definitive pitfall.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller is allegedly turning to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not include a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was a foreign exchange in Congress, Mr Trump would have to submit to responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and finally the jury of his colleagues would have to wait for him.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us, which will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938 the German officials were prepared to arrange a march against Hitler, only to be built and supported by the Western powers in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of full bloodshed that followed.
History is about such critical moments that speed up or slow down the inexorable path of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump throws out the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who runs Mr. Mueller's trial?
Rosenstein had been pushing it ever since the report announced that last year he had proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not in a position to stand by the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation by the F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual assault and false statements?
And what's most important, will we choose in half the term of office to Congress, which assigns responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be waiting for a long dark night.
But I believe we're not going to make it, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and about 60 years later, she sent me on Saturday to light candles on the table with candles.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about shooting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday of the Rapid Vienna guest with the realization that the victory over the Rakušana would give them a great hope for the process of the Group of the European League after an impressive remix in Spain at the Villarreal Games earlier this month.
The knee wound prevented the hostage from showing Graham Dorrans in the season for the first time in the game until 2-2 with Villarreel. However, he believes that Rangers can use this result as a reflection bridge to a bigger thing.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," a 31-year-old player said.
“We went into a fight with the faith that we could do something, and we took the point.
We might have been able to reproduce it at the end, but it was a total remix of justice.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
It will be another great European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last match, they've won a good score.
Last year was hard enough, with all those injuries and changes in my club, but now I have a very good feeling.
The team is strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is fine.
I hope we get rid of it now, put the last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement support
Although participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, only a few people talked about it to family members.
A total of half of the people in the national study said that she had been discussing the price of long-term care with her partner.
Only 10% said she talked to her children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't decide to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the whole country's life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you first reveal your wishes.
Find out where and how to take care with your counselor and family, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Admit your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to earn these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay these expenses, or through your own insurance using your own funds – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles as long as it goes.
Determine healthcare representatives, which will be a reliable person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your doctor will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Consider, too, the description of full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are kept safe if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are the doctors called?" asks Martin.
"Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready by hand."

The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when it was shot into the chest, belly and hands.
The police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as "an appropriate act".
The victim didn't pay for the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during the severe earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongal Regent, which is the area north of Paul, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes of 7,5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are several key facts about the city of Paul and the Regent of Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 people in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
It reached a regent stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The region, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main ingredients of the economy in the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
In the province there is also a major interest in nickel, but mainly in Morowola on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, Pala and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by tsunamis in Dongal and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Dhaka in 1996, when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Ohni Circle and is regularly being hit here.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on 26 December was caused by tsunamis that struck 14 countries and prepared for the lives of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the Sumatran coast.
2006: Earthquake of force 6.8 hit them in a degree by Indonesia's largest Java island and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: Earthquake of force 7.6 hit a degree near Pandanga, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people came to life.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra and caused tsunamis of 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for life around 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the Regent Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, no sound was formed, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin's prisoner for the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governors and Vice-Presidents Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued by the agency Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, reports of domestic violence and prevention of arrest.
According to the police report, when his wife tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to Mat-Su Pretral Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of USD 500, says KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt “solutely innocent” when asked for a statement.
Fuel faces three Class A violations, which means it could be sentenced to a year of deprivation of liberty and to fine up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B breach, which was punishable by one-day imprisonment and fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal report.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported a suspicious police attack on the police.
The case is currently before the Alaskan war veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, the violation of the reporting of domestic violence and the detention of weapons under the influence of malicious substances in connection with the incident.
Apparently hit his girlfriend's face.
In 2016, Sarah Palinová was criticized by a group of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of operation and the numbers of victims are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit directly on the part of the island of Sulawesi, which is located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video showing a moment of horror appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors require an exceptional death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – this is an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on the cyclists along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan district by means of a rented truck Home Depot, which had broken down the walker and the cyclists.
In order to deal with the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov 's "humanly" killed eight victims and "humanly" caused a number of injuries, thus defining the conditions for granting the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both of these figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipova of 22 criminal acts, such as murder charges in favour of extortion, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and preparation", claims the complainants and describes the way Saipov did, as cruel, cruel and perverted."
“Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtov, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlijov, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendozy and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca”, is hereby appointed.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Court of Southern District of New York recently sentenced to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Finally, the death penalty was actually executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, with a conspiracy for the Spanish Federation during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were seated on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, was shown in court records during the days and months following the attack of minimal regret.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saip's charges, he told the authorities that he was inspired by monitoring the videos of the Islamic State on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also announced that they also demanded the lifting of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said about 22 charges he felt innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and the condemnation of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of those events for anyone concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's gang had already asked the defendants not to ask for the death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, Brexit NIGEL FARAGE should be entrusted with
Nigel Farage undertook to "mobilize the army of the people" during today's protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's independence party said that politicians must "sympathize" with Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own Members proposed, he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said on his way to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would now be out,” if he was a secretary for Brexit, Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep divide, has still highlighted the conservatives fighting for the collapse of the EU, who have joined a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers in the course of attacks on the Brexit supporters, the Union's ceasefires and the EU's own.
The allies insist that they continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels without regard to the consequences – and they will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between the package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihul where he wanted to go to the Chequers’.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he be a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in the forehead, we'd be out today," he said.
The Ambassador Wellingborough added, "I'll bet Brexit, but we have to knock on the Chequers."
To show his resistance to the EU, he said, "We did not fight world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws."
Mr. Bone has rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and wish to be suspended is quite simple.'
The Brexit Conservatory Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they do not like him as members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets for us to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs Mayo, she says, "Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage has stated that conservative policies must "get into an unpleasant situation" if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you.'
In his report, he added: "I want our political class, which is in the area of Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who have assured us of victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the United Kingdom, which will rule alone."
In the meantime, members of the Union were attending Birmingham and then organized two-hour meetings in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of the operation of this party.
Labourer Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives due to problems with the party's security application after the conference started.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for problem-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's the whole bottle.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,’ he added.
Warren is planning to think carefully about the candidacy of the President
American Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after November's elections, "he will think carefully about the candidacy in the presidency".
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday at the council in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the honorary critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November election against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It felt in the centre of speculation that Trump could be built in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electorate at the workshop from the time Trump was in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to be taken over by the Bureau of the President.
Warren's report states that the time has come, "to allow women to express themselves to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which also means a woman in the highest position."

Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world's champion when the team regime joined him in victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valteri Bottas finished his qualification on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team regime would play a major role in the race.
From the field of position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two stops he robbed his position and called on Vettel to attack the team's partner.
The Vettel entered the depot as the first one and let Hamilton get the vehicles running for the moment of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider went into the depot about a circle later and then joined the Vettel after the departure. However, Hamilton stepped forward and in the close battle the Ferrari rider had to leave the inner road free to defend himself in the third round after the double maneuver.
Max Verstappen came out of the back row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was at his 21st birthday in command.
He then led a large part of the race because he held the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad word of the body.
President Donald Trump smiled at Senator Diane Feinstein's Saturday meeting because she insisted she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh of a sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate's judicial commission, instead of saying that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and repugnant."
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Senara, when you see the relationship when you see those people being angry and angry and hostile and spreading,” he said.
“When you look at the publications and the publications and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you escape for that?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ,oh,oh,what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not," he added, and he resembled the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to leave her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaint, nor did I publish information about the case," said Mr. Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, according to her words, the president, who expressed himself at a meeting on Saturday evening, said: “I’ll tell you that this is a really bad word of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst word I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats used these accusations to their own ends.
“They are determined to take too much back any available means.
You can see the disgrace, the arrogance, they care about who has to get into the country to get back to power and to corrode," the Mediaite president quoted.
Elitní league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants versus Dundee
Dundee Stars set up a Friday victory in the Elite League against Belfast Giants won a Saturday party in Dundee, which ended 5-3.

Francois Bouchard then again compared with Dundee, the two branches of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the elite league in the season for the Adam Keefe team, which was able to defeat 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.

The air traffic controller died to allow hundreds of people on board the aircraft to avoid earthquakes
The leading air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died as he watched as he managed to fly safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake caused by tsunamis in the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong ensuing quakes swept the area, and many people remained trapped in the busy city of Pala.
However, while his 11-year-old colleague Anthonyus Gunavan Agganga fled to save his life, he refused to leave his seat in the wild with the driving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the run at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the driveway down when he thought it was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaking air traffic management Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, told the Australian ABC News television channel that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared the transport of a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was transferred to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster resolution indicated that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unexplained under the fire and many of them are still missing rescuers,” said the spokespersons of Sutopo Purvo Nugro.
Vlny in the devastated Palu reached heights up to six meters. In the city, there will be mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring to the affected areas of assistance and delivery.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said at the Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance brings in other bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN station: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will actually find on the spot.
It's a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Wido came to Paul on Sunday and told the country’s military personnel: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks you need to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN introduced.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after the crash of a plane in the lagoon one person is missing
The air carrier, who had been in a camp on one of the Pacific micro- Islands, now stated that one person was wrong, at first stating that all passengers and crew of 47 persons were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in the press report that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline stated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the requirements for the provision of details on this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped to save other passengers and crews after the plane got into the water while trying to get to the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials claimed that a total of seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and were all in a stabilised condition.
What caused the accident and the exact outcome of the event, however, remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and the Navy stated that the plane arrived in the camp even before the train arrived.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over.
American traveler Bill Jaynes stated that the plane had landed at very low altitudes.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that along with the others, he managed to get water from a deep stream to the emergency exits of the flying plane.
He further stated that the crew panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mariners who worked close to the port mill had helped to save by means of an inflammation boat carrying passengers on the coast before the plane sinked to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades, aircraft with a registration mark PNG total 111 people died, but no accidents occurred with Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The complaint on Saturday ended its speech in this case in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to life in the State of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice, in his personal analysis, Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury planned a scenario using the records from the phone 29 of Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett pointed out that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, listed The Clarion Ledger.
When it was found that he spent the night with Chambers, he found out he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford stood before the court in the chamber and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the complainants asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "I'm lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another accident was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that these two only met for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he removed text messages from Chambers, calling and contact information from his phone.
"He took her all out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins its final speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.

Another black man?
Newer complains a few of his outputs after a "racist" text message
A New Yorker laments a few of her discriminatory findings after receiving a missent text message from her mother, in which she was marked as a "other black" text message.
A few refused to be racists and compared the complaint with the "debt".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when her first day at work in 2016 found that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ, OTHER BERNOŠKA”, wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her husband, Maurice sent her a drink twice.
When she understood her false passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman rejected Maurice and said that she was just leaving an Afro-American educator, she was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, she introduced New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and was sent to Uber's house.
Now Maurice complains about compensation for work out of work and seeks compensation for $350 per day of a six-month engagement for which she was originally hired, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," the Post said this Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination."
However, the two returned the strike by not being racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared that after that attack they could no longer believe her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, introduced the Post list.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you treated as a grave, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
But come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to “striking” and stated that his wife cared for only two months of her old child and was in “a very difficult situation”.
"Would you like to drive for someone like that?
That's not a good thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the judge still persists, the jury on social media quickly condemned two people for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the story of the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not be related to the talking bear, showing the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the rapporteur: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it first, even before it is published.
It's very fun to know, but now that we know the great success of the Bear Paddington."
She noted that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC, before being inspired to write a child's book on a small gas bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet" tape after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"I was a very quiet person, never was anything intimidating," she said.
“But because Paddington was so realistic for him, it was like having a child that achieved something that you can really be proud of.
I think he's been watching this look at Paddington's success.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his accomplishments to Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was quickly transferred to Louise Pasteura 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Now he called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I should have called from Nada, where she told me she was dying in two more minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart moving, lost her effectiveness slowly and left her body.
She died a short time ago, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering the loss of her daughter, took her to the plane with the other passengers, without showing how difficult the test is just going on.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head shut, my face was shaking with tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just over the years when I felt a tremendous sense of understanding toward Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women send viewers to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are spreading the views of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, he died at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, stated that her son had been given a young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could shed light on every room."
However, he left his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the unstable body of his relatives after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am constantly afraid of what it will have to do with his life.”
Ms. Davis’s point of view, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and who can talk to them, even if it was about their friends.
Don't sit down, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' girlfriend, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"Nothing told me that she was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all," she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day of the day – when the children opened the presents, and he didn't look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma to them, but she had to gradually get it: “This can make a complete hole in the family.
It broke us up.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something that we were actually asking for – an investigation in time of limitations, with a limited amount – we could enter some units into it,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would “depart” because both parties would bury themselves after the partisan in the positions they had acquired.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
Elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, November 6th, and if the Republicans are misinformed, it will lead to their primary weakening in trying to get the man requested to be sent to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbyed them for Mr. Kavanagh's support, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI gets his message?
The Senate will vote on this and is currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice-President Mike Pence to break the motion and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea to Kim "flashed"
The numbers of refugees from North to South Korea have declined from the beginning of the Kim Chong-Un government seven years ago, the South Korean legislator claims.
Park Byeong-seug, with a quote from the South Korean Union Ministry, stated that in the last year there were 1127 escapes – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that there are more stringent controls on borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of required border passengers.
Pchjongang has not made any public statements to that effect.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for the South Korean population.
Saul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is more likely to cross it than in the difficult protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China on refugees tends to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often is forced to return.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are still in the war situation, has improved significantly in recent months.
This month, leaders of both countries met in Pchjongang for talks that focused on stopped denuclearization.
This was the historic June meeting of the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea, Ri Jong, accused the United States of failing to make any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to let us defend ourselves on the one hand," Ri said in a speech before the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosiová called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate for the Supreme Court to serve
The leader of the democratic minority Nancy Pelosiová called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that due to his temper, he was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's note was made in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I could not help myself, but if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosiová said in his response to Kavanaugh's quarterly statement before the Senate commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both still in puberty.
During his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and excited about his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against it were "great and coordinated" organised liberals who were unable to move across Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosova stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was supposed to be against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by these statements and by the way he supported the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosova answered the question as to whether it would attempt to withdraw Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received most of the representatives in Snow.
“I will tell you this – if Congress does not tell the truth, then it is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which he is now working,” Pelosiová said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the potential results of Kavanaugh in court at the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because it was considered a conservative judge.
In the course of hearing his previous confirmation in his office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question as to whether he would return some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"There is no time for a hysterical, supposed person to go to court and expect us to just say "Jee, that's beautiful," said Pelosiová.
And women have to rule it.
After a verbal accident, months, and years, she was unable to escape without crying.
"We cry when we're married," Mrs. Steinem told me about 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who was working with the director and who told me that she was also crying when she had a relationship, but she made a certain technique, which means that when she had a relationship and started crying, the person who spoke to her said: “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I have a relationship."
And that's how she went on.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from the first job where I worked in the office where men dominated. I once expressed my indescribable attitude with tears, but the older, always the cold manager, who was always a little scared, caught my neck and dragged me to the cemetery.
"Never tell them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're right.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a non-marriage affair aboard the Monkey Business ship and had to get out of the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There have already been seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and seven ducks."
Because the campaign had been running for a long time, she was unable to take a step towards receiving contributions and thus committed herself not to getting into a match unless she earned $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to the male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was absolutely convinced by her emotions — as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to obtain money and to focus on the voter rather than on the delegates and from the relationship over sexism, that she was fully involved.
"You might think I was nervous," Mrs. Schroeder said about how she reacted to the press.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they might write me on the gravestone.
"Plakala"?"
Why can China-American trade war be good for Beijing
The initial wave of trade wars between the United States and China has been aggravating, and even though the battle is not far away, experts believe that the gap between countries is beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by issuing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
However, most of the major escalations saw the world light this week, when new tariffs for goods of USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion) were announced, which practically means taxing half of China's exports to the United States.
Beijing has always responded, with a recent drop in tariffs of between five and ten percent of US imports of 60 billion goods.
China has tried to pay the United States the same money, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would have collapsed.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original rounds, it would mean meeting his demands, but the public details of the US requirements would be totally humiliating for the Chinese President Si Xin-Pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Peking could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The reality is that the rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would leave economic collapse in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have allowed so far," said Abigail Grace, a research cooperative who is focusing on Asia in the thought tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, foreign minister
Syria claims that it is prepared to return refugees voluntarily and appeals for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN Foreign Minister at the Valne Assembly, Walid al-Moual stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists to a normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have been focused on their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in the construction of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that we do not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe has responded to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with the final score 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost its sixth in Europe, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. Star, Phil Mickelson, who spent most of his tour, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 jackets and left the victory of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then stared in all his wheels and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the 1979 tournament was approved.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who has just graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veterán eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy I got the cup back.
Everything matters to the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Rampo, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible thirst for defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend trying to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomase and Tony Finau, who had a peak golf course during the whole tournament.
“ I’m really proud of those boys, ” said Captain Jim Fury of the unsatisfying results of his team.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't do it.
I'm gonna get my hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players really played very well.
Let's regroup and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to relax.
You beat us."
