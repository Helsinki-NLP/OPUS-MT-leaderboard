Novak helped Trabzonspora elsewhere, hit himself and Škoda
Defender Filip Novak helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor as vice-master.
His team won 2:1 at the stake of Kayserispor and held the third Besiktas.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave after an ice break from Slavia the tenth branch for Riszepor, who saved himself, even though it was 1:3 on the stake of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In 63 minutes, the Golman Kayserisporu just fired a shot and the Czech footballer from the corner set the ball on the net.
The house managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor, in six minutes of setting up, shot victory on his side when he successfully scored four for one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce was equal to 1:1.
The opposition did not last long, but it did not have to hate him, because because of the results of the rivals behind him, three points remained above the descent.
The competition brings together the Sunday duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy playground.
Well hidden by Jeskyně in the woods at New Bora was not in fact resident
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužický Mountains, near New Boru in the Českolipsk, in the woods that led the Countess Way, there are a number of sand rocks hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're giving up behind that man's hand created.
The place is called Jeskyna at the desert.
In fact, however, there was never a rebel here, and the cave served as a hidden, more precise hidden chamber probably on the crop.
The cave is stretched from the side to the rock guard and accessible along the stairs of the mountains.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last minute.
She will be exposed to the narrow pits leading to a rock gallery from which she can only enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human settlements, at the time of creation it could be on the upper surface, where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object has no window and no place in the traditional place of heat clearly shows that there was never any founder to survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podružek of the Philosophical Faculty of Evangelist Purkyno in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone beam in the back, which is probably used for the decommissioning of the vessel.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podružek.
The cave walls have trails of tools.
The cracking of the sandstone with its peaks was quite simple and rapid.
It was enough to use the spices and the sander gradually to break down.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and even the method of tracking, it is possible to define the period of occurrence of the cave.
According to history, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes sleep in today’s times.
If you approach the cave of a mountain from one of the forest roads and we take you under the cave of a flowing stream and not by the dug road, you will surely find the path down too.
And by the way of the woods, you'll have to catch the nearby Havranian rocks.
Zokaj Minarík is after a difficult fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is set up in similar cases, and we have a happy family in Hanover.
This makes it much easier for me to deal with the situation and also to take care of the daughter of Finj," the server Jezdci.cz quoted Minaríka's wife Katji's statement.
"Everyone's doing the maximum, Philip now needs time for rehab.
It doesn't make any sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who's ever faced the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a five-year-old cook.
To the financial support of the wounded Minarík, he called on Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, and he balanced the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, almost 70,000 euros have been chosen to date.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
The video player took Sassuola's football players four goals, lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers, though in the Saturday match in Naples, got four balls in the competition market, but finally they had to fight the 0:2 defeat.
Not one of their goals would have known after consultation with the video because of the oasis.
According to the Italian media, it is a record misappropriation of technology, so many inputs have never faded into one team yet.
"VAR was more intense on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him like no other team yet.
New technology markets records," said the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.
"The festival of the unknown goals of Sassuol.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," Corriere dello Sport added.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday at 8:00, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Philip Djuricic was not recognized after the intervention of the video chatter because of the ossajd.
For the same reason, they did not pay any further Djuric's arrests and trials of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the contrary, they added another goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In Czech Republic, they won the most in history
"The growth was as high as 30 percent of the increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the rapid development of the registration of new e-autos," said Chez Tomáš Chmelík, chief of the clean technologies department.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car manufacturer, are also reported on on the market, as well as Bill and Lidl's supermarkets.
The operators of classical pump stations are represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"Our electricity network has just begun to build the floor," Jan Juskova's spokesman explained.
The editor, however, exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stations operated by CEZ.
It turns out that the drivers from the station took on an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we remember a small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average bid takes two and a half hours.
The long majority of the tankers then went free of charge.
If the motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the main city.
In the territory of Prague, there are all five of the most expensive brands of CEZ, which have its popular shade and the entire rural city.
Between the regions, Olomouc knows.
On the other hand, the slightest interest is about a remote station in the border, such as the Bohuminá or the Prachatí, which often remain unutilized throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In the extensive survey of "Cheese in Move", eight percent of readers said that purchases of electric cars in the family were considered.
Only a third of the respondents, however, know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
The organizers believe that the government's efforts to protect and heal the Czech countryside and to solve the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more realistic approach.
The actions called the Last Cup were attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who go out for a long time against the expansion down the Tours, there are people who go out against the demand for stork at the Uherska Ostrog, there are people who go out against the construction of foolish fences," said organizers Marika Wolfová.
It noted that the main requirements for protestors are the creation of a plan for the retention of water in the country, the significant change in agricultural policy and the system of aid to support sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is about to throw people's interests away, not inconceivable and devastating business," she said.
In the Malostrans place, a station with a petition calling for a Czech State representative was set up to deal with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The present people were equipped with transparency with passwords such as "End of strips of tape" or "Minimum carbon, more men".
From South Moravy to Prague, Jan Škoda from the team came for water for people who protested against the plan of the shercopic demand for Hodoninsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that gardens represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to it, the planned shercopic exercise is only about 500 metres from the gardens and the verdicts suggest that water quality will be compromised.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valeč in Karlovarska Vojtech Vesely.
He warned about small farms that are not expected to yield and profit and that they keep the residents directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, while the proposals do not find such a disaster in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died on a plane crash at the house in Germany
At the fall of the ultralight aircraft at the dwelling house in western Germany, three people died today and two others were injured.
They informed the local rescue components, which are probably two members of the deceased and one of the residents of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Porina-Westphalia.
The basement apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, then caught fire.
The Hasichs have already managed to get the flames under control.

According to the police, the third victim is the woman who lived in the house.
Dénik Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) with an appeal at Wesel’s old age wrote that it was the mother of a self-employed woman whose two-year-old daughter was saved from the apartment with slight injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, a emergency crash was found, which he was able to use as a stop at landing.
The police are coming from a hacked plane.
There were room for two people at the airport.
The car was starting off at Marl's airport.
The Rheinische Post, with a call for clear witnesses, stated that the plane was hit by a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane had collapsed in the air before the crash on the ground.
The Czech discount on Saturday miscalculated some payments twice.
Error has been removed.
The Czech discounted on Saturday morning to its customers miscalculated some payments twice.
According to the speech bank Lukas Kropika, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The problems with double-counting karate payments were well-recorded on Saturday afternoon.
" Yesterday (Saturday) we carried out a system update and all these double payments immediately returned to customers.
At this point, everything works without problems," Kopik said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank has taken out of cash twice, the bank's spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, was less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems are verifiable.
"It could be a combination of several factors," said Kropik.
The Czech discount is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, soldiers will present a three-stage emergency system against coronavir
"They will continue to rely on the force of Community enlargement at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtich said in CT.
It is called semafor, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red, depending on the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the classification of individual countries.
He assumed that only Moravskosleslez country would now have orange color and would be close to Prague.
The map will also include individual measures for national hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Water and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonah and the carpenter's daughter Caroline look at themselves, they don't have a simple one.
Jonah's love for his father's defense, the miserable waterman Hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
There's still a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole world, especially Caroline, from this waterfall.
What if he's gonna intrigue and lie?
Especially if he can get Caroline Jonas to reject and favor him, he'll be happy with Libor.
Suddenly, it is clear to everyone who can drown the humble Convička, contaminated with the flour, the fire of the mill and other lotteries.
The ravages of the villagers arrange the hon for a watertight, and yet an irrefutable watertight curse will come upon Jonah’s head.
And now Convič's soul of Caroline!
How to wrap up the old Hastribute, convince the neighbors about Jonah’s innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The story took place in September 2010 in the CT studies and abroad in the fishermen of Brzina, in the Obdeniums in Sedlčanska and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovići.

The duration of most diseases is mild, only three percent of patients are infected in the hospital.
Both Czech and Czech are expanding the smaller form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved immunity.
The infection division of the patients is semi-empty, even if the number of infected adults.
"This situation today and in April is completely different and it is given primarily to the number of hospitalized people," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtich.
It is worth noting that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all the pigs carried out, the elections carried out by the army, the Republic was closed and the Czechs needed disinfection for the year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now there are daily increases in the number of infected higher, but every day with covid-19, there are up to two people dying.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, and the same number has already been reported by Jihlava due to fire in the local Alzheimer's Centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Other homes for the seniors were closed by the hygienics in Montenegro at the Královéhradeck.
The inability to test was confirmed by one of the nurses.
"We search, we limit movement, we have all hygiene measures," says the home director of the pensioners Martin Schanjel.
According to him, none of the clients at home have symptoms of illness yet.
General testing will start with hygiene tomorrow and then decide on another measure.
An increased number of infected people are also responding to hospitals.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows whether people have access to the infected pig.
The record is reported by the Yugoslav hygienics who have recorded fifty cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign workers of the company.
In total, there were 131 people infected on Saturday - half of the number of Fridays - but the weekend is less tested.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh dopsal my beach, Andersona smetl
The big surprise tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh also performed excellent performance in the fight with a player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in 2018.
The start of the match was bilaterally balanced , the break came in at 8:7 for the Belgian plumber .
Van den Bergh has taken a team of 13 chip law, and since then he's had a plan.
His opponent literally shook his game, and the more experienced "Flying Scott" was only hard to get to the doubles.
The way she was "the Creator of Dreams" in her bosom, it also testifies to the fact that dissipated Anderson played its first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed excellent high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the 11th leg, for a bad condition, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
He was more of a hacker than a hacker, and he was a superhero of the triumphing rival.
Van den Bergh changed immediately the first of the three match gifts and got his name - wrote his big dream.
The prize of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian plumber than it is to be his first winner.
Still so paid that the last player who managed to defeat van den Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes there was an accusation for the fire of the cathedral, a man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th - century vitrative window and destroyed the guards.
The investigators’ suspicions about the fire were investigated because the fire had been carried out by a temple of three different places.
At the same time, the police found no sign of anyone being raped in the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 29-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she missed him without starting a criminal investigation.
The prosecutor now informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, admitted and faced charges of fire.
In case he's found guilty, he'll be threatened by ten years of imprisonment and high punishment.
According to his lawyer, a man is sorry and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, Le Monde wrote.
Vytėch: On Monday we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of the pandemic plan, due to its absence from the government and the Ministry of Health criticism.
"They will continue to rely on the force of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravskoslez country or Prague would reach a central, orange level.
The system is proposed as a regional because the situation in individual countries varies significantly.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
At each stage, specific measures will be imposed, according to the Minister, whether the obligation to carry pigs or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Party, which would allow people to have clear information on what measures they could expect if the epidemiological situation worsened.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
The soldiers commented that there is nothing fundamental about the statement of exceptional status or the re-calling of the crisis staff.
The government, given the increasing number of people affected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, has again imposed an obligation to carry pigs in their own actions over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now making 1,000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear to the last minute, what measures and when they start paying, and when they are not announced, has come up with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create the opposite sense of security and the confusion rather balance," said Senator Marek Hilsher in Questions.
The measures can now vary according to the region, such as in Prague from Sunday to Sunday, and also in non-resident medical facilities, for example in doctors or in medical clinics.
The obligation to carry pigs during visits to health and social facilities or doctors has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberian and Ústek region.
In the University of Jihlava, it is necessary to carry pigs in indoor public spaces, in MDDs and in health facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, the anti-epedemic measures were released in the Moravian region, as was the case in the Middle East.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also approved a so-called ‘semafort’ for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
In countries with low and medium risk, the Office does not require a negative test on or instead of quarantine for the Czech citizens from 15 June.
They are obliged to return to the Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category of infections.
The tech parties in Benešovska are on the move.
Plays on third-party capacity, ends in the afternoon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovska) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhoty in Benšovska continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, after 8:00 p.m., there are about 500 people left, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, they were 900 in the morning, said police spokesman Lucie Novaková.
Originally, the technoparties had to end on Sunday in the afternoon, during which a really quiet part of the music systems had been silenced.
"Some have already left, and others are about to leave.
Music production is still in part.
We expect that it will gradually come to the resuscitation and resolution of music systems," Novaková said.
"Politicians continue to monitor outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or conventional substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breath tests before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers on the scene, there are foreign police, transport and police, and they are also on the alert with the service dogs.
"During this day the police checked 470 persons moving in the place of action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of which were sitting behind a wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novaková said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested the presence of mindless and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also solved 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the Technical Party, the police carried out 300 preventive respiratory tests and four preventive tests on the presence of tainted and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants wasn't reduced, the police would be in there.
In the series, Prime Party Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said that.
But the number of participants was reduced by 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, nor did they request a health care station or the Ministry of Health.
On Sunday, the Czech TV (CTS) stated that the technoparties were also extended to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree to the use of technoparties.
It is possible that owners of surrounding lands will claim compensation for damage.
The technicians at Hlaváčovy Lhoty arrived on Friday night.
The police were looking for a hole in Blaži in Benešovska on Friday, where the technoparty was taking place last year.
It is about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčov Lhoty, where the technicians were actually sitting.
According to Novakov, no one came to Blaži.
Smashing snake: Girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the Iron Curtain.
The snake stuck a girl there, the year 2010 that the parents themselves brought to the dark base of the rescue service," said Denika's country spokesman Mías Svobodová, saying that the child was then transferred to the hospital in Klatoveh.
The snake is the only poisoned snake in the Czech Republic, and just in the Forest, these animals are in higher numbers, so it is good to pay attention in the walks.
But there's no big danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you, it's not too high, when you're in regular contact, they're afraid of themselves.
And if there's room for that, he likes to go away for a loud squeezing.
It only attacks if you feel very threatened - for example, when you fall into it by mistake.
Even her oppression is not a tragedy, but her food is very effective against small sheep, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is especially for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person often has a sense of repulsiveness, sweating, increased fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals and in particular allergies, can come to an anaphylactic shock," said Danik Miriam Gredová from Klatov's hospital.
The man threatened to throw the twins out of the window.
After a police officer poured wine and threw the pot.
After 23:00, an intruder and a man kept in the apartment.
The couriers immediately took over to the care of the health care professionals, reported in a press report by the local police spokesman Markét Janovská.
The man didn't want to work with the police, after the police negotiator threw a drink, a knife, or a glass of wine.
He strengthened his threats several times during the negotiations by putting his child in his arms out of the window.
He even went out on his own to the parapet of a window where he was opening.
The police are still investigating men.
More information is not yet available.

Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur won't affect the season affected by coronavir this year.
16-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June, but he still doesn't want to finish his career.
For the next year, he plans to return to the resorts and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he enjoys tennis even more than he used to.
Stosur, two weeks ago on social networks, announced that her partner, Liz Astling, was born in mid-June to daughter Genevieve.

The WTA Tour will be relaunched from the March interrupted by the 3rd August anti-tank tournament in Palermo.
Sapa: Once it has discovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles going into the area carried 1320 pieces of kiln eggs of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be eliminated in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the living fish stand, it was found that the seller has no evidence of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, during the winter, the veterinarians discovered an illegal food sale, which contained almost half a tonne of unmarked food without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, part of the product was sustained and was damaged.
In five kilograms of sepia, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, the veterinarians with police officers in the market area of 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, oil or frozen ducks, which were part of the dance.
Putin telephoned Zelenski before starting directly in Donbasa, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned his Ukrainian opponent Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he has to start paying a new fee since midnight.
According to Kremlin's statement, among other things, he criticised the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
In the new peace of arms, the Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed on Wednesday evening to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The approach is to begin after midnight at night on Monday, to be "full and general" and to open the way to fulfilling other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told the Greens in the debate that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to organise local elections is opposed to the peace agreements from Minsk and threatens the prospects for the settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the elections to the local representatives would not be held in the territory of the Peruvian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of Ukraine's occupied separatists with Russia after it gives these regions broad autonomy and organises local elections here.
According to the Union Agency’s Green Office, the two states agreed to the benefits of the upcoming approach in Donbasa and to the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of the fighting areas or the landing of part of the units from the front.
Putina also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop the fights, but in occasional shootings and shooting attacks on both sides of the front, people are still dying.
The conflict in Donbasa has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow rejects.
Since the end of the war in Donbas, Greensky has made his priority, but it has not yet happened.
The unexpected master in the tenth is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotná
The winner of the last two titles Dolejal did not complete the four-week program, Kopecký did not skip the base on Sunday.
For decades, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who has been preparing for the group of dogs of Joseph Karas, has been on the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside MCHR, this time he was the only ten soldiers who got across the seven-month border.
Other medals followed by William Straský and Petr Urbanek.
He recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helleleta and Jiří Sykora after the competition.
"It's a shame that there weren't boys here and Kope didn't set up because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very well, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave a person about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still happy with the stick and the most disappointed me with the disk, I was half-mediated there," he admitted on the federal facebook.
The first day of the seventh was won with more than a hundred times as much as Kateřina Cachová, although she suffered the injured ankle on the reflective leg.
In the remote sector, however, she then wrote only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters and did not enter the final eight-foot camp.
She collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Catherine Dvořákov.
She's out of the way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around 630.
Yesterday I started to pull the trigger, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even copy me," said Novotná on the federal facebook.
Bio LPG reached Czech Republic, promises organic operation
The LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its mainly lower price against petrol or oil, given significantly lower consumption taxes, but its benefits are also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically stable variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is all news - the proposal first appeared on the European market and, according to the press report, the Czech LPG Association arrived several days ago.
"In these days we received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with classical fossil LPG at our pumping station," quoted Jiří Karlík's association from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biooil.
According to the association, the chemical site is compatible with the classic oil LPG, which is now fuelled by a number of motorists in their cars.
That's why it's also possible for both versions to mix freely.
"The only difference against classical LPG is the way of production," says Bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the Association.
This is also said to be one of the major benefits of LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar varieties.
In the future, it should also be produced targeted, for example from cellulose biomass, that is, from wood waste.
On the other hand, classical effluent LPG is partly produced as a by-product for refining oil, partly separated in the use of natural gas.
The result is therefore, depending on the production technology and the source of the operation of the car for the bio LPG by 40-70% environmentally sounder from the point of view of the carbon footprint than the operation of the oil LPG and up to 90% compared to the oil.
However, it is not about emissions of CO2 from the exhaust of the car, but about the fuel production ecology, i.e. part "well-to-tank" (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is examining the possibility of production and company in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the Czech Association, about 170 thousand LPG vehicles are driving; the Ministry of the Environment reports in the NAP ČM about a higher number, about 200 thousand.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 cars on the LPG drive were carried out last year only.
In the Czech Republic it is possible to tap LPG at approximately 950 different operators stations.
The army audited the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtech (for the United Nations) ordered the Ministry to review the numbers infected with coronavir.
New statistics have published the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
Sunday's number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less infected by 1775.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 3422 patients.
"As a result of the increase in the number of people treated, a revision of the data that the health care professionals have not been trying to update lately," said head of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavir in Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured, and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately sustained.
Mobile election units or corresponding choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for a period of pandemic
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD), the law needs to be amended in order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October national and Senate elections for coronavir.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He set it up on Sunday at Prima's TV party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Let's do whatever it takes to change the election law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government on Wednesday to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote for health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained, for example for patients with open-label tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the OVM series, stated that the possibility of a corresponding election has been postponed since 2004.
And the current draft law, which is in the locker room, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the panel considers the concerns of the UN or the ČSSD (because it would, according to experience from abroad, rather record other types of parties) from the corresponding election as overestimated.
It is then personally against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Mikhal Klima said that it is now necessary to develop ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could already be achieved this year and with the least health risk.
The main point is to prepare for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The corresponding choice (whether only abroad or also in Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As another, he sees the above-mentioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Because of the spread of coronavir infections, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries in the world.
Protests in Bucharest: The pig's ears threw demonstrators at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet attacked the building of the pig's government.
It was another of the series of protests against the "mafia style of governance", which has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning a state-wide blockade, the DPA has established.
Today's protest, which has taken place 18 days later, has, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom, had a worse participation than before.
At 20:00, about 300 people met, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the building government made a scene of theatre, where they symbolically closed the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gesche in connection with the arrest of two councillors of President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
Both of them are part of the basic requirements of protestors.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in the construction on the Black Sea coast.
The protest organizer Nikolaj Hadzigenov said today in a public announcement that on Wednesday there is a "top-top escalation" in the form of a "colon-national demonstration in Sofia and blockade throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as the writing of the early elections.
The proper ones should be made in March 2021.
Borisov already told me he wasn't planning to resign.
It also justified the need to carry out the Bulgarian pandemic of covid-19 and resulting from the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, as if the protestant's resignation had not calmed down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government stopped voting on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlović doesn't want any more games without spectators
Boloni Siniš Mihajlović's football coach already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian watch hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're currently operating here is not a football.
I've got my teeth full of no spectators.
It's a harmless football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
To play like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovic said before today's fight against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, the Series A matches follow in a fast track, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible weather.
Under such conditions, they don't even know how the teams are on it.
It's about to end this season.
The action had to be taken in order to win the competition, but I hope that since September the fans will be back," said a visitor who had also led Fiorentin or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlović, this season is unusual, and because four months on the toilet was missing due to leukemia treatment.
"In spite of my illness, the break-up of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up.
We want further growth and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of a cyberattack of foreign states, Iran claims.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranians have argued that the fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cybernetic sabotage.
The reason for the series of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abbas Musáví told reporters in Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" daily.
He added that it's not about a new eve and that most of them can resist.
In the past months, the Musávia reported several wider cybernetic attacks, which resulted in an analysis of "certain governments and groups".
However, Reuters did not provide any details on possible winners.
Mustard also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in summer.
This month, the Iranian state agency's article discussed that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
Not one of these countries has been directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
The long-term strained relations between the two countries emerged in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran, which have a strong impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US army killed the Iranian General Kassam Solaimje and member of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdí Muhandise.
Iran then set fire to the base in Iraq on January 8th, where the U.S. is active, a lot of rockets.
The United States has refused to admit that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its criminal enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran rejects.
The TPCA car has extended the production delay, now until 25 May
Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) was once again prolonged by a drop in production due to coronavir.
Production lines should be relaunched on Monday, 25 May morning.
The course will follow dozens of hygienic measures, said the speakers of the car Tomáš Paroubek.
The production is due to the pandemic of coronavir since the 18th of March.
Originally, the company intended to renew it on Monday, 18 May.
Due to the extension of the derogations, Paroubka has closed the border and closed the dealership, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will be producing 100 per cent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is a key company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Starosta Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the production gap in the TPCA is not signed for life in the city.
"At first it was known, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are full, especially since Monday, when it's a lot relaxed.
So the city is full," Kashpar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in the accommodation.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kashpar said.
For example, a young-boleslavska Škoda Auto, which, due to the coronavir crisis, also interrupted production, restored it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production factories in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works for 100 percent of the capacity.
The restoration of production in Scotland has accompanied more than 80 hygienic measures.
On Monday night, in Mladé Boleslava and Quasinás, the first time the production was restored was a third, i.e. the night shift.
In TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working, and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employee in Cologne.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: Leave a message to the family
More than two years ago, she was fighting with Gemma Sisson's infernal cancer, and when it seemed that cancer was over, the disease called again.
A nine - year - old woman who loved culturalism eventually ended up in a hospital bed where she had yet to take her life.
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
A few hours after her death, on the social network facebook, a shocking message appeared for the closest.
Gemma Sisson from England loved culture.
With a friend of Rick Moore, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
A nine-year-old woman had a healthy sport, although she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019 cancer returned and this time a five-year attack occurred.
The culturalist and personal trainer, according to the British daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation of the fifth and then again began a drastic treatment.
It was all a waste.
At the beginning of this year, at her 90th birthday, her doctors told her that she had a few months left.
In April, the blonde finally decided to go to a hospital in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her beloved Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma on their two-month anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, on her social network account, she found a contribution that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm gonna have a broken heart that I'm leaving my loved ones here, I'm so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who has been on my side all along and has given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that pain and suffering finally got up and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.
Art machines sell a travel list, amulets from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the rolling cape works are obtained by most starting Czech artists.
Images and other creations are made directly for the artifacts, so they know in advance that they have to go to 8,5 to 5,5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curator text about the artist in the package and then work alone," said the curator of the Petra Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by the artistic work he acquires.
At present, you may need to become the new owner of fancy illustrations by Alexandra Stoplovov or mini-views from Terezy Bonavoent, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Doru Dutkov prepared pexeso associated with the Prague crossing.
The cards should be packed with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrova and Juliana Chomová sell a bag of spirituality: the first of the artist offers a protective amulet from pregnancy and witchcraft cards, the second series of illustrations coming from her comics Spiritist.
Health payments will grow by up to five percent next year.
Higher elevations are not real according to Vojtěch
Payments in health care could increase by up to five percent in the next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtich (for the UN) in Questions Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The need for experts to raise up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aid.
According to him, they now have their resources.
"I think that growth (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
It considers that it is necessary to reflect the current situation when, from March to March, it has succeeded in selecting the insurance pandemic of kronavir and the government regulation against its spread.
Let's get the insurance guys down at the time.
"I'm going to have an increase of 15 percent at this point in reality," Vojtech said.
The average monthly salary of a doctor in acute bed care according to the date of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the payment of a sister in state hospitals and the rent of other brokers will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from UZIS also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has been stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns in 2019 according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, representatives of the Committee indicated that, for 2021, they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the distribution of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by payment tables, and by contractual loans in hospitals, cities, countries or private individuals.
Therefore, they also require that the pay tables be uniform for health professionals.
In nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, doctors, but last year the wages grew faster than payments.
According to the Czech President, the dental chamber of Roman Schmucler should see how it is at present.
The recent impact of the covid epidemic has led to an increase in the public budget's budget for the record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is intended to go to hospital and social services.
The Board of Health Care providers, according to Šmucler, does not agree with the flat-rate navigation of payments in the following year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospital itself and the medical facilities and the money should also be passed over to them.
The soldiers also stated that the hospitals currently have a lot of protective help.
The President of the Administration of State Stock Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any health aid protection in its possession.
He's waiting for the final election.
According to Vojtech, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the State should try to be even more self-sufficient and also to buy from Czech companies.
A cunning quarantiner could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"The smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and it is a question of whether they should not manage the whole again," the president of the government said on Sunday in his facebook series, Ceau people.
According to it, it is not able to connect enough IT systems and hygienic stations, which need to gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in Moravskoslez, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The Ministry of Defence spokesperson Jan Pejšek for the ČTK stated that he had no information on the Sundays and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the master quarantiner led a 19-year-old central management team established under the army as a government advisory body, led by former ministers of Roman Prymula.
The current project on Sunday was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
And he said he could take the army again.
The project's shortcomings have already allowed the government power for IT and the digitisation of Vladimir Dzurilla, who cares about it.
"The system works, but it's still working on it.
Twenty years have come about by itself and without a system, now we're trying to unite within a few months.
It's not a push.
People on the move, the poor on the hygienes on the move adapt those new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Primitor Macura won't run again, he doesn't want to "get involved in politics"
Current island prime minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in future municipal elections.
The reason is the effort "not to get involved in politics," said the server Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the UN presidency, is the Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, it received a leading candidate for the ANO movement in Ostrava, almost a third of the votes cast.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would endure one functional period and with this experience from the business here, I could turn everything around and put it on my feet," said Respect.
He added that during the second election period, he was allowed to talk to a certain degree.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be fooled by this policy," Macura added, who in the conversation marked himself as a difficult introvert that does not match frequent contact with people.
According to respect, there has been a longer period of speculation about the possible end of Macroura in the motion of the UN.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the UN movement several times, for example for the association with the SPD movement or for the support of Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities of the ANO he supported in Zeman's election against Jiří Drahos.
Macura does not plan to leave from the ANO movement that he entered in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in motion, that it's not a completely vain fight, and that no one's in any hurry, I have no immediate motive to end," said Respect.
Sixteen-year-old Macura graduated from high school economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, inter alia, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He's also been sitting in the organs of other companies.
To Brno returns Uber offering transport services
By the end of July, Uber will be returning to Brno, which offers transport services.
This is the result of a change in the law, he stated on Thursday in a press release by the Brna Council for the Transport of Petr Kratochwil (ODS).
Against Uberu in Brno, the taxis protested, pointed out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, since July the law has changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and the alternative ones.
In recent weeks, he has completed several discussions with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return with its services to Brno.
This step is the result of a change in the law which allows the legal operation of this company.
The city has been familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochwil said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
They protested against him by not marking vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court has issued a preliminary measure which prevented Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, last year at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Markét Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July it has been observed that, alongside classic taxis, the light and taximeter can easily operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too much buoyant celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment she flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and fell about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the guards.
As soon as she arrived at that address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window under which she was still lying on a chair and next to several backpacks and non-slips.
"The arm, which was worn from the room at the fourth floor, indicated that there was a relatively loud celebration in it.
The officers went on their way to the apartment and asked three young men from the age of sixty to ninety years for an explanation," spokespersons of Jakub Ghana said.
Request for withdrawal Rafaje will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) is planning on Monday with coalition social democrats to discuss a request for the motion for the removal of the head of the Antitrust Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
To withdraw Rafaje, non-profit organizations called for the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Ústek country.
Social Democrats point out that the exchange in front of the office is on the ground.
According to ČTK Rafaj, no invitation was made to the Government Office on Monday.
The second mandate will end in half of next year, under the law it cannot be appointed a third.
His resignation is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar requirement from the Ústek region.
The reason they're supposed to be out of Rafajo's case since the last time.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to state that the materials would be made known and the government would take "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet met with the President, that he had no meeting with him at the earliest meeting.
According to UOHS, there is no reason why Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Currently.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafay's meeting with the Hitman Jiři Ček.
The meetings were linked, inter alia, to the decision on competition for a draft controversial new outpatient hospital for eight billion, which Cunek strongly advocates.
The boy admitted to the meeting, according to him, they resolved his "consensual activities".
So does Rafaj.
The representative of the Ústek country to withdraw Rafaje called for the government at the end of June.
It also calls for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of ÚOHS on public contracts according to the Heitman's transport hire, Jaroslav Kominka is not transparent and has signs of discretion.
Last March, the police raided the antitrust office for a myth election trend.
This year in June, then the server Currently.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using the apartments written on the company of an influential back-up player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The amount of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafay's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition is Rafaj from 9 July 2009, for the second term of office of the former President of Social Democracy in June 2015.
In the next year, Rafay's second sixty-one mandate will be launched.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not function for a period of more than six months, or seriously violates the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blancho library, the workers were collaborating with heat.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technique will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanca regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
There was terrible air and bad air.
Wind didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of the Lebanese readers Petr Novotní.
According to the director of the Lukás Dlapa library, temperatures in the building were often rising to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the object is therefore exhaled and in the sundays it works as a glass.
"The sun also supports a large part of the day thanks to the curved building.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to explore because it must be closed at night for safety reasons.
Often we have been in the library since the morning to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst was the studio and the computer on the third floor.
And then on the floor, the exhibition rooms and the director.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children’s department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians were collaborating and ending up in a job failure.
The problem also arose regularly in the cultural halls at lectures visiting dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing there," Dlapa noted.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning this year in all the library spaces.
In the end, there will only be three circles of five.
"Because of limited funding, they will only have the most problematic areas.
The studio and the computer on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department on four heights," Jiří Svoboda of the Blané Investment Committee informed.
He added that, at the first stage, workers in the basement in the said space had installed air technology and adjusted the electrical installation.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The city library Blanco has three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.

Crawford returns to the game
Not each of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent about the health of the players as a grave and don't publish anything at all.
As one of the few came out of the Crawford series.
A 15-year-old relative from Montreal was present only at the first training, since then he had been missing in the assembly.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positively on Covid-19 and that is why I spent the last fourteen days locked in my house," he explained the reason for my inability.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford's ready to go back to full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I'll do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," I added.
The experienced golman has won two Stanley Cupy with Chicaggage, a ten-season season already in line.
Blackhawks is waiting for the first preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they'll be in front of Edmonton.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places in the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the crisis.
The demonstrations were performed outside of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand Netanyahua's resignation because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government solves another wave of the kronavir epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," said AP agency one of the demonstrators wrote to his transparency, referring to Netanjahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," he stood on another.
Seventeen-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister in the performance of his duties.
He is accused of three causes of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
All charges are rejected and marked by a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process may last up to three years, over 300 witnesses were called.
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, confirmed itself among 60.00 people.
455 people died in connection with the infection.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily increases in infected people.
After the gradual release of the restrictions from the end of April, but in particular, the end of the red number of infected again began to rise significantly.
Netanyahu's critics claim that the government did not help enough, for example, professionals affected by quarantine measures.
The protesting is also the fact that the government in the framework of the fight against coronavir issues conflicting guidance.

Pietro Filipi breaks down and agrees on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and relax in this key change of strategy.
He's going down the stairs and he doesn't want to scratch one collection after another anymore.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental pollutants is not news.
In the ovens and in the pans, billions of pieces of clothing are finished each year.
Look at slow fashion, often reverse access to clothing, but in recent years it changes relatively quickly.
About half of Peter Filipi’s goods were sold at a full price.
The second half, which I'm selling, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to scratch one collection at a time and at the end of each season produce at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michal Mitchy, new and old collections and blind follow-up are away quickly with changing fashion trends.
"Most traders with discounts are already counting on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included at the full price.
So it's actually a little bit of a fraud," says owner Pietro Filipi Micha.
In addition, the company wants to support local business.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide is a segment of the premium marks of any absences typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Miča adds.
The giant graffiti represents the flight of RAF Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our racing pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal to lead the city was popular," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He consumed about 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
For the war of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an international camp where he had been held for weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp because of Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF) and later studied pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He engaged in war operations early in 1945.
After the Soviet revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice several times, which gave him an honorary citizenship.
A 16-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the street graphic art industry know under the name Camo, has been working for over 20 years in tepid streets.
The graffiti began on the premises that the former Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) had set up for these purposes.
Bouře Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna reached the southwestern coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight SELČ at night).
He hit the Pacific island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and when he moved over the fortress he was weakened by a tropical storm.
However, meteorologists believe that it poses a major threat to the population of coastal areas.
In fact, he brought strong wind and intense impact; along with local floods, electricity accidents and various material damage were reported by the AP agency, including damaged ships.
The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has already announced the state of natural disasters on Saturday for 32 periods in Southeast Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were received from people from the coast band between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but in general he lived to reach the territory nearly 500 kilometers long than he gradually moved over northern Mexico.
"Although Hannah is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising cold, dangerous proximity and a single tornado may pose a threat," warned the U.S. National Hurricane Centre (NHC).
This morning, local time (in the afternoon SELČ) drove the storm to the US-Mexico border and accompanied the wind at an hour’s speed of 85 kilometres.
Hannah became the first hurricane this year's Hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was carried by wind at speeds up to 145 kilometers an hour, but it gradually weakened down to 112 kilometers an hour, which made Hannu of the Hurricane category again.
Local authorities called for storms to cross the house and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those American states that the pandemic of disease covid-19 is the most severe.
In view of the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is a great challenge and possible evacuation.
The security guards were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the texa period, Hidalgo was also adapted to one of the buildings as a shelter after evacuated, who had a positive test for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated to take pigs and disinfectant with them, if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," said AP Chrise Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
The predictions say that in some places it may be that within a few hours, up to 300 millimetres [300 mm] of precipitation, in some cases 500 millimetres [500 mm], which together with the sea level could flood a number of seabeds on the coast.
Land loans to Colonel Lipkovi
President Milos Zeman will lend the general value to Colonel Paul Lipkovi on Wednesday.
It follows from a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
Due to the loan of the Brigadier General's value, July's August approach to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance's Multinational North-East Division in Poland.
July has thus far acted as the deputy commander of the earthly forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, July will replace Brigadier General Karl Réhk as Deputy Commander of the Multinational North-East Division in the Polish Elblag, which directs the units of the Alliance's pre-existing presence in the territory of Poland and Baltimore.
In March, he became Director of the National Office for Cybersecurity and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipkovi borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
According to the call for soldiers law, the higher value of the soldier may be lent during the performance of the function or during the performance of the service task which requires a higher value loan.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the general value.
The soldier to whom the value was lent has the same rights and obligations as if he was appointed to this value.
However, there is no claim to modify the payment that would correspond to the values.
The amount of the loan is due to the fact that it was granted to him.
"The Colonel Lipka is a highly professionally trained and a model for the subordinates.
A significant contribution is made to the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the involvement of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence, said in June to propose an increase.
The central increase will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or Chief of General Staff Ales Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for the travel of aircraft to help reduce the spread of new coronavir.
It was announced by German transport minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the departure or carrying of the powder in the aeroplane and at the airport, but the average seats in the aeroplanes will not have to remain unencumbered.
She informed that agency Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that ministers still had to formally approve it.
The measures agreed shall include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended derogation in the context of safety checks and landing at the airport.
The aircraft must also provide fresh air and all information must be available in a number of languages.
Aeroplanes will also be able to accommodate the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
The different standards were the result of confusion.
The arctic Spicbers dropped a temperature record, they measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen, 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute stated on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, adding 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record.
The hill of the two thousand-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spicberkas, located about 1,300 kilometers from the northern pole.
Spicbers heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other continents of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the previous report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in the Spicberkas, according to it, rose from the 1970s to the 20th century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even climb ten degrees unless greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth in Spicberka can result in permanent freezing of the soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause even greater quantities of lava and soil droughts.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or tunas, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits who come back from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called for the risk of spreading the disease to be avoided by all roads to mainland Spain, which are not necessary.
So the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomat stated in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that, if it is necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British Letter Metro, the latest announcement will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are also concerned about whether they will be paid sickly if they will have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne had a ten-week vacation at Lanzarote, they had to leave on Tuesday.
The train has been ordered since December.
"We had a whole family, my wife Amanda and the daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I'm working as a master and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back from the last two weeks in quarantine," the Metro Hunter newspaper quoted.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave epidemic.
During the last two days, over 900 newly infected people were always there in 24 hours.
Offices in some areas are already promoting coronavir measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit every nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs again pointed to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and the region of Madrid.
Model purchase of electricity from Dukovan government
On Monday, the government will exchange a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new nuclear power plant Dukovany.
The proposal for a law shall be calculated in the event that the purchase price is higher than the price of the power plant on the market, the difference shall be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
The electric force is an unregulated part of the final price of the electric power for the receiver.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the CEZ energy company have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save their power building.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always irrelevant, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The target has already been criticised by the environmental organization.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of the power plant and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed between customers according to the size of the insurer - at lower consumption or at the consumption of electricity - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MPO) stated in the basis for materials.
The Havlíček said in May that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will grow and people at Dukovan building.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year on the family, which it considers to be far less than people pay each year in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
Earlier, he estimated that the ransom price could be between 50 and 60 euros (approximately 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthodin (MWh).
The material in question does not contain any proposal for an amount, shall be included in the contract of purchase.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most stocked by traders, is currently around 45 euros (approximately 1190 CZK) for MWh.
"In contrast to the cost and market prices of ten euro power plants, it could make an average household allowance of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-year households, standardly equipped with electric consumption including electrical safety boards and pipes, but not using the heating and heating of hot water - a few 100 CZK/year," wrote in the basis for the MPO government.
"We live in an unsatisfied turbulence.
Pandemie coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecasting of market prices to be a highly speculative issue," said the CTC's former Executive Director of the Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is calculated by means of the purchase of MPOs, respectively, by the legal person entrusted to it by the State at the pre-established price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, and also repeated, however, not long before the end of the operation of low carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as a production power with a nuclear reactor connected to the installed power system with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MWs) after 2030.
The Havlíček earlier stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodin electricity annually, which would correspond to ten expected Czech consumption.
The block should be placed in service in 2036.
The model financing of the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The installation should be financed in a non-performing manner, accounting for a two-percent increase in operation.
The funding model does not agree with the opposition, it also suggests that Dukovans would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be divided by 70 percent on the building.
The balance should be paid to the CEZ company, which will also build all possible additional costs.
CEZ Director-General Daniel Benesh said in May CTK that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the State and the CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded materials to support tourism in the media in two billion
Material that the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend on the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on a holiday in the Czech Republic of two billion crowns, the Office of the Reminder.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for the UN) server List of Messages.cz said that she is still working on the material.
The eKlepu document (e-mail library of the legislative process) was notified on Friday by the Zportrechty.cz server.
The Ministry of Planning has justified the loss of road traffic due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, a decrease in income and the media was observed.
The proposal raised criticism of the opposition and the representatives of the road traffic.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on the watchstatu.cz website, MMR was planning to provide money via the State Agency to support the travel of CzechTourism on TV, broadcast, press, on the Internet, billboards or platforms.
The biggest part of the money, that's 700 million crowns to get TV.
Most of them would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The advertising stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and spaces at stations or in meters.
The campaign to support travel in the Czech Republic should begin in half August and last a year.
"The material is still working, certainly not in the form that should be presented," said Dostalová without further details on the List of Messages server.
Material criticised the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Pekar Adam's Markets, media from the Sverige funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše (ANO) would benefit from advertising.
"I firmly believe that this apparent humiliation will get in the basement at the choice of the wound between the eyes," she wrote on the Twitter.
The Commission rejects the fact that it is actually aid to the media in the face of the crisis.
"It may also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Danika N on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's a work material," she added.
Initiately Save tourism does not have a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in travel, not the rest of the advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, writes an initiative in an open letter from the government.
Product of life, beer and death as a grain of grass
Death is also the third album titled And death is the stem of the grass of the brinny poet, the unconstitutional organizer of cultural activities and publisher of Jaroslav Erika Friče, who also left the year before, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography, the fifth item, as in previous titles, is also here the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the only outstanding interpreter.
Fear, the year 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through its own personal experiences and also very bold expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from the dogs when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I think in that context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníkov), the masters will pass.
Fricho's album offers recordings of the 2006 author's reading, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to her, whether she was a violinist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoný and Vítězslav Holata.
I am happy - the words of the island poet Petra Hrušky about the long poetry compositions.
"Salam out of them proud and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "on the condition of our world threatened by decay.
The world, which is becoming more and more insidious in consumer greed and greed, is increasingly alienated from what its soul was created from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
They were called upon to know who knows that the values for which they were created are of little interest, but who also knows that they are not of general interest.
They have reminded us that a person may have to come to know everything precious, but he is not unworthy of how it will come to be.
If it is sold to a general collapse, skepticically withdraws, fearfully shuts down, or remains for the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what it believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček
Former Prime Minister and President of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The president and interior minister, Jan Hamáček, communicates with him only and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamaček said that today in the Prima Party TV series.
That Paroubek should be Hamáčka's advisor, the server informed the List of Messages.cz on Friday.
"From time to time we write an essay, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that it is not about official and paid cooperation.
According to ČSSD, it does not have the means to fly them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so many such people are," he said.
In the next discussion with the ODS MP Jano Montenegro's Minister said that many members of ODS are still "indiscriminately listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay, because it's about an experienced policy and the former president of the party, which is also Paroubka's case.
The fact that the media are making an affair was marked by this year's curry season.
Server ListMessages.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's informal consultant.
He also wrote that in the fourth place of the party's candidacy in the eastern part of the country, a certain president of Peter Benda's dark cell that was connected with Paroubke and acted as vice president of his party LEV 21.
Hamaček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile, it's a kick in the ass, it's a Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American printer has ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like for two years to defeat the younger Dublinis, he beat her last year at the club of the University of NCAA.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was second, and then we passed it.
In both cases, it was a very good struggle," describes Nilsen, who secured his victory with a performance of 5,95 metres.
But since then, Duplantis has fired a sharp upwards and is currently located in the highest spheres of the press.
In just 20 years, he became a world recordman, and on February 8th, in Toruni, he crossed a plane of 6,17 metres, a week later in Glasgow, added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his cousin Nilsen for World Athletics web site.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent were ten.
Twenty years is a whole good age for jumping a world record," he thinks.
While Nilsen's score of success is thinner than the one that is proud of Duplantis, the American has set similar goals.
So far, he pointed out his chances at the NCAA competitions that he regularly won, this year in February, he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. Loni won a gold medal in the panoramic games in Lima in August, and in 2017, he fought for the American race at the world championship where he finished 13.
The closest lover then is to taste the diamond league for him first.
"It's my priority to get to the professional circle and race the most in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well on events as Olympics, world championships or Panamanian games."
However, because of the pandemic, these top celebrations are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to get Duplantis, which can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver struggle?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think it's gonna be possible as soon as possible," Nilsen thinks.
"That boy's been jumping for 16 years and he's got all the other miles in his training."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, she's going to want to raise it.
A woman has lost statistics on the invalid son's income.
The court is waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalid income is primarily designed to improve the quality of his life.
She's been threatening a woman for eight years.
Because of the poor health condition, the court of the sick man of liberty and his mother set up a guardian, who, among other things, was supposed to manage the money of his sons.
"The woman, from mid-November 2013 to this year's January, used part of her son's pension funds for her own needs and prepared it for 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, saying that the accused woman was concerned that as a guardian she had a special duty to combat the interests of the injured.
The woman, as instructed by the court, arranged a bill for her son, only to allow his pension to be transferred to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in the health care facility and replacing the necessary medicines, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of vehicles, electric consumers and on the foot of the home," he complained.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, a woman admitted.
But she hesitated to help them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to avoid the passage of home.
We've never bought anything that's super standard.
It was always on the thing that the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't realize that I could afford to commit a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son's money would come back.
North America has been sitting there for 30,000 years, hard scientists have found tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include the 1930 tools of the weapon, among which are even fine sharps that could be used for the cooking of the meat, and spicy objects that could serve as the games of the sheep or a grave.
Scientists have found that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said the archeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this topic in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools are 12 500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite cavemen, located at a high sea level, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, generally recognized theory has said that the first representatives of Homo sapiens passed through the fortress bridge from Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique toys of copies used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovis culture subsequently expanded in much of North America.
This model, however, has been obtained in the last decades of the market, when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, there are 42 different locations throughout North America, which show human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that small numbers of people could have come to the North American fortress before it was supposed to.
Some of them were able to get their ships to America.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada in the province of Alberta.
The interest in flying is still filling up an optimistic scenario, hard salesmen.
The prices are being gradually reduced
He sells tickets in the Czech Republic grow every week.
On the contrary, last summer's interest is still almost half, but demand increases by 20 percent every week.
The development after the crisis thus, according to the sellers, fills the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of flights are being gradually reduced.
Among the most sought-after destinations are according to sellers in particular to the South European States.
According to the Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the port of Letuška.cz the most sell flights to the Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, is the most sought-after Great Britain, which, however, has always been the most sought-after destination.
The average price of flights is also reduced.
At the portal Letuška.cz, approximately half a month, around 6250 kroner, averaged 3,000 kroner less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped by about five in the last few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying air tickets with much less than before because they are afraid of further development of the coronavir situation.
According to previous Kiwi.com information, the time of purchase of the flight before departure was reduced by approximately ten days.
"It reinforces our future trend when people order flights with a much smaller front, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President for Kiwi.com Michal Shindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
The number of renewed airline lines from the Czech Republic is also increasing with sales growth.
There are currently regular links to more than 60 destinations in Prague airport.
It's about half the destination against last summer season.

The biggest surprise World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps knowing that it has nothing to lose, helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.

A big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but then, in a calm, Belgian series, he got a jump, which he held to the end most without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which struck a temporary uncertainty on doubles.

This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top in countries such as the United States, Brazil or India, but according to the Reuters agency, the number of new cases in the last week has grown in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The order has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case has officially announced the KLDR today.
The air in the homes is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor air quality in the outdoors but also at home.
She pointed out that the Israeli specialist in human health, Carol Abraham, had already quoted The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was in charge of setting up the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on the damage in households right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), which says that the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) judges that because of poor air quality in its homes, 3.8 million people die annually.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to it, the quality of "home air" is almost forgotten.
Hazardous, however, can be the things that people usually come into contact with — insects, air coolers, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"Natural gas also emits clothes that we regularly wear in the cleaner," said Abraham.
The most threatened are children, elderly members of the household and people with breathing problems.
Otherwise, individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, dizziness, nose irritation, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
During long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all damage, but from objects within the household, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
