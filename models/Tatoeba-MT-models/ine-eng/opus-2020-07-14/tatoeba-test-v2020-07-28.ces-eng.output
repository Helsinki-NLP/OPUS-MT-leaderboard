Be careful with the kid.
Would you like that?
I'll pay for that coffee.
Don't lose hope.
I don't take that kind of weight.
Tom cheated on Mary.
Call her tomorrow.
I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were dirty.
They're playing at home.
I don't know why I'm still in trouble.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog bit a few blinds.
Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary seemed like a widow.
I don't want to go for a ride.
When Tom came home tonight, he found out there was no dinner left on him.
He knows them.
They're certainly very proud of their daughter.
Tom went off the road and Mary gave up on the other side.
One left.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom has a lithium stomach, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to count on her son.
He knows wine.
Tom felt someone slamming his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words can say how wonderful you are.
I'd like some fruit juice.
Is he going to shower tomorrow?
The clinical writings found by Sumery were used in many languages in the Middle East.
I love summer, but I can't stand it.
Of course I do!
Mary loves you.
What do you want?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never talks to me in French.
Tom left it on the table high.
It's not over the beer glass all day long.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been happy with my work so far.
You really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's my map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even if they invited me.
Are you still here?
I thought you were going with Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Just like that and then transport and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be thirteen in the afternoon.
Cut the meat on thin plates.
I can't watch you ruin your life.
Do everything with discretion.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We went to the top of the Fuji Mountains.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Remember what she was like?
I'm very close to that tail.
Playing the faggot is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was concerned about the subject.
We have a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be acting selfish.
The old habits are rapidly measured today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here right now.
Tom's helpless.
I like to read.
We've cut the wire.
I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on its knees.
What did Tom scream at the bottom?
She's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to parties in costumes from the seventeenth century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he jumped out on the tree.
Translating the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I left for breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not going home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for this job.
They're crashing.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't mind telling Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you have a fight with Joan?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered by black darkness.
I need more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave you a pillow.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you driving to school by train?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
Tom, not Mary.
What if you invited me to a glass?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me when it happens.
He's free.
These people don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom's got his legs washed.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a fool when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
She spends a lot of time with her computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He'll visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom wasn't having fun anymore.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he got hurt.
Peru laundry.
This bridge was a paid bridge.
He was hanging on her.
I came to school late this morning.
I took part in the search.
I went straight to the bed.
We shot the lawn at the river.
Tom never had a hard drink.
Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know which one.
Tom fell for Mary.
I'm really happy alone.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
They've been standing here half of the destroyed wall.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did anyone ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The plot is freshly sorted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're out of your mind.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I'm not warning you to open your mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you do it?
There were no doubts at all.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
Once we saw what Tom's got on us, we got a laugh.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's screaming.
I loaned Tom a mine.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my vows.
I'm not that big anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If he doesn't bite tomorrow, we'll go to the tower.
Try and talk to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll get something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She was bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom was drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know it's nice.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle it on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the roof.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's out.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw that balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I were a better man.
You're stealing, aren't you?
Tom has to take part.
You should first consult a lawyer.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is stuck again.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone had ruined our apartment.
Read the book.
This was a bakery.
My father's running a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like him movies.
This works.
Stop laughing.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
It's easy, it's easy to forget.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Don't be her help, I'd never pass that test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom said Mary wasn't planning to go swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The commitment seemed to be in vain.
If you need further information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
When you get here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy loves him.
Tom and Mary met John.
Please don't do this.
You'll be happy again.
The kid went four.
Tom doesn't take his medication.
"Did you not see my phone?" "It's on the table."
Tom went to his box.
The first jump was wrong.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.
In England the clerk asked us, 'How many beers would you give, half a pint, or all?' 'Because we had no idea how much it might be, we asked him to show us the glass.
I'll tell Tom to cut your lawn.
I'd rather have English than music.
I like fish.
They're all screaming.
Tom's parents supported him during his studies.
It makes sense for a morale.
If you have any problems, don't you dare come after me.
He's rude and unscrupulous and people are away from him.
He killed Laila himself.
You're smart.
He's too self-conscious.
The companies may have to miss some employees.

This shirt needs to be fired.
He's not alone anymore.
I doubt that.

I don't know how to behave.
Tom's still a young man.
I could get used to living here.
They wanted to sell the house.
You know how to use it?
The egg is hard.

What'd I miss?
Daddy's a drug.
My father won't let me walk out alone at night.
Tom's making candles.
Don't try to live forever.
It wasn't as easy as I thought.
She brought you something.
Why don't you just give Tom a kiss?
He's drunk.
He threatened to kill her if he didn't listen to him.
I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary is a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Cold and exciting, we finally reached the guesthouse.
It's not important, is it?
Can't you get me a blanket?
You're a good cook, aren't you?
I just wanted to say thank you.
Who's gonna pay for it?
Don't give up hope.
She wasn't cold.
Tom asked Mary to make him coffee.
They asked if they should write a new word.
He's growing tomatoes in the garden.
Many people don't like hospitals.
Would you give me a glass of milk?
Tom read the magazine when he was waiting for Mary to appear.
My name is Ivan.
I'll never get used to it.
I want to be famous.
It's not the size that matters, it's the way to use it.
It looks familiar.
I don't mind telling you if you need anything.
I already did.
Tom has three older brothers.
He's living for fame.
I burned my fingers on a hot iron.
Tom forgot his wallet at home.
We've already done our part.
I don't like to wait any longer.

You've forgotten.
Where's Dad?
How were those bombs fired?
Tom said Mary shouldn't try to do it alone.
Tom had a white shirt on.
I think you could help me.
Can you update our programs?
He can't be hungry, he just ate.
Tom's going to Boston next summer.
Let me help you.
Tom didn't know where to go.
Tom didn't know if it was true.
Go fast, or the bus will eat you.
I know it's hard to see.
Give me those scissors.
I thought Tom would do it for us.
You have to finish it.
You're gonna get it out of your mouth.
And history has always changed.

The work of a noble man.
Sometimes I feel like we're a lot of bullies.
I'm almost twice as old as you.

How can I sacrifice something I don't believe in?
Who wants another piece of cake?
It's too soon to go to sleep.
Tom's been allowed to wait a long time.
What if we asked Tom?
I was very excited.
He kissed her back of his hand.
Tom's explanation wasn't very good.
I don't want to go to school.
Make sure you don't get on the wrong bus.
Tom visited Mary at the hospital.
I can't live alone.
All these three beautiful girls are my nieces.
Try this!
I loved you more than anyone else.
You want me to put it on the table?
It's him.
They won't let me go.
You can rely on him.
You lost your head, didn't you?
Tom's building the wall.
He was tired and that's why he went to bed fast.
Why are people afraid of you?
Tom likes animals.
The car needs repair.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
How did it get here?
The safety of young people is supported by violent movies and computer games.
Some criminals will remain unscrupulous.
Tom likes basketball.
Tom won't be waiting anymore.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Tom was mean.
I can't leave you.
Nobody's got it yet.
The copper and silver are both metal.
Touch me.
We got another chance.
Have you ever been to Okinawa?
This is the best Indian restaurant in all of Tokyo.

I wish I'd be more popular.
My uncle gave me a book.
I'm in this new job.
I should've continued.
Why doesn't anyone want to talk about it?
I'd like to be as young as you.

It was my duty to do it.
You really want to stay young forever?

It's me who usually cooks for the family.
Let's get out of here.
I got inspiration somehow.
Did you see my pen?
Marie's Tom's own sister.
Mary's more honest than Tom.
You're doomed to this fate.

I like art.
I don't think he's coming.
I'm going through video advertising whenever I can.
They're running.
You don't count your opinion.
Aggressive drivers who do not keep a safe distance are dangerous to the public. Failure to keep a safe distance is a kind of aggression behind the wheel.

Don't run to the broken glass.
Time's running out.
You can't kill me.
