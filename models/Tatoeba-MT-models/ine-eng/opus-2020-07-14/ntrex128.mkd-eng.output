The members of the Wells People's Assembly are concerned that "they look like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are surprised by their proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the House of the Great).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that it may be the subject of ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party Congregation said his party was concerned that "removed with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: on the Welsh Twp means "boot/crazy", and pwp means "like".
Plaid's member said the party as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party's actions were "free" to change the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" (Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English word "u".
The Committee of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a law for the introduction of name-changes, said: "The final decision for which any words will be called members of the congregation will, of course, bring the members themselves."
Wells' 2017 government law enabled Wells' congregation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated great support for the congregation's appointment as the Velki Parliament.
On the question of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission preferred the members of the Velki parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support from public consultation.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for the congregation's president, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was put to try to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Djirge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's voice was silenced while the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historic, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither one or the other."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in another way today," he said.
"The Bars are no longer living rooms in the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by buildings full of people who will not help the rest of the sanctuary in the settlement.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that is why the day when these churches will be completely closed is not likely to become members of these churches.
The two churches were built from white congregations in front of Harlem to become the metropolis of the blacks — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The congregation of non - Witnesses who practice their faith in the neighborhood takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over from the Black Congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th street, the main market street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carilon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the Carolon "the call of the poor".
The expert who played the Carolon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carilon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part of the church's inconvenient leaders, and a part of the bishop's parish.
The Church Committee – the church’s leading body, composed of informal leaders – writes to the parish in July with concern that the parish “will "request to transfer the expenses" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the parish.
Some parish members complained of a lack of transparency by the parish.
A shark injured a 13-year-old baby in a lobster nest in California
Eikula attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while a lobster net in California, on the day of opening the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack happened about 7 hours ago near the Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel reported on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had bled with friends about an hour early on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then tied to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was a thrill to catch a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
It's late!'
"Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I tried to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the child's Radi hospital in San Diego. He's in a critical condition.
We don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gills, told the press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the chest.
Authorities closed the beach on the beach of Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most do not consider them dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has taken Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty rafts in the style of business houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as the sales in the fashion and household area fall, the major beauty rafts will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be presented in more shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space of the rifles that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's, they said for the first time they would double the offer of funds for beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-starts its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for veganzas, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which was opened in Craydon, South London last week, and the second was opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying less food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, director of Sainsbury's, said stores would increasingly look like supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounts Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which they said increased the sales of feeders and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt on the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested joint acceptance with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement on how to share the profit from chemical retailers in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our rafts for beauty to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to respond to any need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a debtor destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "suffered" after Holly Willowby withdrew from a deal worth 11 million pounds.
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "slow" after TV leader Holly Willowby withdrew from a deal worth 11 million pounds with his brand-new life-style business to focus on her new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their brand True for products and household supplements.
The two business is related to the Goop brand of Guineat Paltrou.
This 37-year-old morning program leader told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, withdrawing from their lucrative brand-new lifestyle business at the last moment to focus on her new big deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "slow" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer has time to dedicate herself to their brand True for products and household supplements.
The business is related to the Goop brand of Guineat Paltrou and it was said that Willowby's wealth would double the estimated 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he had left True, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them absolutely impatient.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning program leader, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can make the company millions because of large investments in feathers and candles products, up to household clothes and products and because of the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truey with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willouby is to become an ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Ant McCartlin as the leader of "I'm A Celebrity" (I'm a star) on ITV.
Source close to Jones yesterday said "We don't comment on his business vices".
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he would get from the media for commenting that some would consider him "unpresidency" and because he is so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Tramp give up so many things?
Tramp said with his voice turned out to be a "presenter of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "response" from the United States for the early steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the meeting.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this excellent co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – the rocket tests ended, helped free hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this full arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and carried hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need it.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, there was not an elemental accident, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international help, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palo, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that continue to plague Indonesia, the country remains desperate for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters in Aceh have been built, they are not a common sight on the other shores.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued, was likely to contribute to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for treatment of the victims of the earthquake has headed to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Joko Vidodo's election campaign was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also faced with pressure from sexual tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, spears, and other ancient weapons.
See, Daniel Starage of the Liverpool team is against Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Prime Minister's league with a goal in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Starji the ball to about 30 yards of Chelsea’s naked coat, while his team lost 1 - 0.
He transferred the ball to the left before he directed it to the distant article.
The ball was moving high over the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the network.
The ball finally passed through the broken Cape Arisabalag and crashed into the network.
"He was just trying to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 at half an hour after the Belgian star One Hazard gave a goal in 25 minutes.
The "blue" attacker gave the fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the ground, and then sprinted into the middle of Liverpool.
They quickly gave themselves to the Covac in the middle of the field.
He then directed the missile, leading Hazard to the 16th century.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the network of the far-left article with a left leg next to Alison Baker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoleon in the group phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in WEFA League Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5-strong earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-foot waves, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was devastated by the ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhed, Mercside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found in 7.55 with Grayson Movs' stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but it would ask the people who were near John Street in Birkenhede, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially the cab drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesperson that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhed and was found in an object.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as the police have said, they will inform the victim's neighbors.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Movs just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him it was not allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were now told that they would spend hours before they could return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared on the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible."
At 2.00 a.m., two police vans were on the border, and another one was outside.
Countless policemen were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact anonymous fighters against a crime of 0800 555 111, quoting record 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's parliament status has become the latest memory strike in the drive to "rewrite history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The English Civil War Iconoclass was neither ordered nor issued by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestors, Thomas, in the last century.
The beautiful presentation of Ser William Hamo Thornejcroft by Cromwell is evidence of 19th - century thinking and of some of the historical figures that many believe are still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of a continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped our nation's development then, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord-Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
Pig attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with the skin artery, wrapped in blood near the market in Leupanshui in Gicou, South China, said Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place pigs' vaccines on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with the cousin of the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig’s horse.
He said that there was a large calf in the chariot with the blood of the bull.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the severer 550 pounds broke down the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Wu", according to the quote in the evening news of Guyana.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The life that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
Market manager said about the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked humans have been reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650 - pound - pig tied a giant farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to grin, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to the southwestern United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain showers to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, hurricane of category 1 of 500 east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to develop and is moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to import a large tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico's shares on Monday.
Then, the tropical wave of the approaching depression will produce abundant rains in the southeastern part of the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, torrents of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause storms that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches an hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the south-west, especially in most Arizona.
The sudden floods are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions that are due to the dropped nature of the tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended not to go into the desert walk at the possibility of tropical rain.
The rain may cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and the storm storm will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local torrential rain to parts of the South California coast.
There are rains of more than half an inch, which may cause torrents of destructive and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
Temporary tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning on Monday before the rain spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread in the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures are expected to change everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical regions remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyn, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to reinvigorate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the summer.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long - term forecast indicates the possibility of an average temperature for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavano’s hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault reportedly occurring in the 1980s, Cristina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the inexhaustible political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular conversion programmes last Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, has concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week prosecution investigation.
Ford told the senate court committee that it was 100 percent sure that Cavano had taken her drunk and tried to take off her high school clothes.
Cavano, in a passionate witness, said it's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company included average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people looking at offices.
To make it look better, it's a audience with a size similar to a football game or the prizes of the film Academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavano's appointment, ran ahead of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flick was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After moderately the Republican Office issued a statement that it would vote for Kawano, CNN and CBS cameras captured as protestors called him on Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes pressed for a few minutes while he was being beaten, and all of this was being transferred to CNN alive.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth about the earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flick said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee had to vote to advance the nomination of Cavano in the voting chamber.
But Flick said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominated next week, which was requested by the minority of Democrats.
Flick was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns, and with several senators then, Fleke made a decision.
Flick's election was of great significance, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavano without an investigation.
President Tramp opened an FBI investigation into Kavano's accusations.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" on the coast
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right up to her on the newspaper's main page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Brigitt, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the costs is "totally absurd".
Fire at Wade Sims: Police arrested Suspect Diton Simson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect at Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diotion Simpson was arrested and imprisoned in a second-degree murder case, Baton Ruž's police department said.
The authorities released a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner of CBS said.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said he confessed he shot Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of eastern Baton Ruž's parish announced a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot wound in the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the criminalist state police lab, the South University Police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activism in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-step beak grew up in Baton Rož, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 scored ball per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" since Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," the coach said.
The volcano poured ashes on Mexico City
The casting of ashes from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern settlements of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it started activity in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center followed more tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ashes on cars in the inhabited places of Mexico City, such as Socimilko.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of the 45-mile volcano (72km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the year of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protestors clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarisation vote for the removal of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists held by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the right, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later on the day they also beat fights, and the police used their thumbs to catch fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups called "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protestors called "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, said from the local press.
The tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the outcome was small because of the boycott by the people who opposed separation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to force the vote at the polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Six and eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia had a chance to gain independence.
"We lived one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they fought a vital but close victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics this year with many of their most well-known leaders or in a self-elected pursuit or in prison waiting for trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the consequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, filming the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that he will run the European Parliament elections next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested after they hit a car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car crashing into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage to the gate and the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could be fired with an arrow from the car to the car.
Menga's strike won the Livingston 1 - 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston's victory
The advanced Livingston posted the Rangers signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as Club Ibrox's manager.
Dolly Menga's guess turned out to be significant while Gary Hold's country's rising to a level with Hisbernian in second position.
The country of Gerard has lost its victory in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they have eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invincible in the division during six competitions, and Coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the harsh guests
Holt's team was supposed to take a long time before they gave up the goal, and their directness caused a lot of Rangers' problems.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts far after he sneezed the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
The guests gladly left the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the actions put in place.
And that's exactly how the judgment goal came.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set Manga together, who just touched the target from the center of the 16th century.
Until then, Rangers dominated the ball possession, but they couldn't break the host defenses, so Golman Liam Kelly didn't play most of it.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was saving Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of the Rangers' Golman, Alan McGregor, and Litgo took the ball away from another set action of Livingstone.
The sixteenth Century of Livingston was constantly passed and was constantly defended, while two demands for the penalty – after Halket's dispute about Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-playing – were rejected.
"Pontomical" by Livingston – analysis
Alaster Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Makaroni arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations of this high road.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as ever under Gerard's leadership, they're now lagging behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the houses – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, who were found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Colony
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They worsened due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the collection of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also explained, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protesters protest the division of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Traffic accident on the road to Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
A bike driver died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the crossroads of Bejudd and Evelyn Street, a major traffic controller in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and came to an emergency, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker in a traffic accident on the Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks are set and buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six policemen injured in unrest
Six prison policemen were injured in an unrest in the male prison with a high level of security, said from the prison's office.
The riots erupted in HMP Long Martin in Worchester at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
Officers are being treated for minor injuries on the spot.
Prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but it is likely that it will happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining force of hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert-west region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings of possible flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays for West Arizona, to the south and east of Nevada, Southeast California, and Yuta, including the cities Phoenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas, and Sight Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move along a straight path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The State Meteorological Station in Phoenix reported on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or depression over 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane over 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models at the State Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the work of Mongolia in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert south-west region, including the central parts of the Carpest Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are outside the risk areas of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the south-west region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring body, almost 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to earth’s defenses everywhere on the peninsula of Lower California in Mexico.
Rosa, still in her early hours of hurricane, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold water in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Hence, rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico may be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
"There is expected rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," said weather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south of Judah until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains are the very abundant rains in Lower California, South-West Sonora and the Western South-West region of the United States," the U.S. Hurricane State Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and torrents of waste, as well as land-silvering in the mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in suspicion of attempted murder since a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelior Terrace in Midsummer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He's been taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Sommerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had cell phone footage from the case, to step up.
Tramp said Kavano "suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voice for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the most harsh and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Villaning, West Virginia.
Tramp said Kavano "suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavano testified before the Thursday convention, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasi Ford’s accusations that he had committed a sex attack on her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified to the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an irreconcilable record of public service," he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned the nomination of Cavano as he spoke of the significance of the expeditiousness of the Republicans of the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "give resistance and prevent".
The first key vote on Cavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior GOP leader of CNN said.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the shore of the sunset, bringing many to death and ruining everything on their way.
After the 7,5 earthquake hit the tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they did not run away immediately, and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesperson for mediation in Indonesia's emergency briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape tsunamis and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of air published by the crash agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, torn - down and destroyed bridges and buildings surrounded by water.
Follow-up tremors continued to shake the coastal town on Sunday.
The earthquake series was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, narrow shore, could increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
Some victims' bodies were found trapped under the bust of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said victims and damage could be increased along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palo, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday that it did not inform that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared by the social media, a man on the upper floors of the building can hear as he calls out, warning the people on the street down for the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall is stuck on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
Earthquake and tsunami caused an interruption of power that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The total number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose above 800.
It's really bad.
As World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in shelters in the yard of their office, they walked through the scenes of the desert, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as the relief teams began their dark attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from travelling to Palo.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian red cross.
"What the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international aid, but there is still no status."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu fell on Friday, friends and families of the missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under the shoe for two days with her mother's body to her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian state team for paraglodyry, trained two of the missing paragloiders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck in Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how, when she began to circulate news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragloiders, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to the competitors from Palo, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of scissors, instead of a son.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they filled out the ATM at the "Newport on Cait"
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from an employee in Brink's who added a ATM to the Newport of Cay, according to a press release at the Newport police station.
The car driver celebrated the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran away from Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has some information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kane West changed his name to Y.
The change was released on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: "The creature is known as the Kanje West."
Forty-one-year-old West wore her ticket for a while and took advantage of the ticket for his eight album, which was released in June.
The change happened just before his Saturday night live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to give up "emotional reasons," the producer of the show said.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with the director Big Boy.
"What do you mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Canaan, which means the only one, to Him alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Didi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former West co-worker, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without drawings and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that "he will never use the Mexican people's army for repression".
The army shot peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when the left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drew young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research resources in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The adoption of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far away from the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the area of AI will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published a month ago by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, director general of Synovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most famous companies for AI in China, Face+.
At the 80s of Karnegi Melon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that won the highest ranking American hotel player, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's border in China.
He thanked her for previous U.S. government technology competitions as the challenge of the Agency's robotics for advanced research projects in the defence and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that "green maps" should be offered automatically to doctors of science by artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Natural Sciences Foundation finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of the work is lower in China, Li said.
Last year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the formation of the Official Art Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSF, more than $100 million is currently invested annually in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted on a Sunday referendum to change its name in "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and puts a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Djorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and the boycotting campaign questioned whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum's validity.
The question of the referendum tab was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying to allow for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote today for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje said.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the outcome was 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josh Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote at the Macedonian referendum on the country's name, which will open the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Stromica.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the last entry," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmed for our future".
The poll, published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the required focus.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote with yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the outcome should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western government after they came to power last May.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed through all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly conquered Brighton’s 2 - 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker was given an environment in the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It's been a long time between three Bryton's defense players before he got into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greens.
He surrounded a defensive player before running a few others to work from the sixteenth century B.C.E.
He then left him, to Sterling.
The English attacker took advantage of his first arrival to the 16th century to bring back Aguero's ball, which with his right leg beat Bryton's throat, Matthew Ryan, with a single shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Gardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave a target at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly Sons" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he took Sterling to the remote article.
The attack on "heavenly blues" put the ball in the net before it went out in the car.
City will fight Hoffenheim at the Championships League in 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rain Necar Arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spy against Rockys.
Since Nashnells was eliminated from the game fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Shercer is hoping to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there's still a playoff for the Rockys team, who are running a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis' team had at least a "joker" place to win from 5-2 over Nashnells on Friday night, but they still struggle to establish their place in the first division.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I'm going to face this year.
Why don't you want me to compete in that?"
Nashnells still needs to publish a starter for a week, but he is reportedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw himself into such a situation.
Shercer, who will start after 34th time, trained to throw on Thursday and usually throw on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tromp meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about Brett Cavano's election to the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the output of the Republicans of the early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continues, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of democracies, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the resources available to them, you see evil, impunity.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt, when they're supposed to go over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "give resistance and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "suffering, evil, insanity and insanity."
He mentioned Senator Diana Finstein from the ranks of the Democrats, set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, on behalf of which the public responded with complaints of malaise.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was a very bad speech on the body – the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
The labs no longer accept different opinions.
Those who show their opinion are not tolerated
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost not a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the ranks of members of parliament from the labyrinth party to whom it was said that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of an East Labor Party meeting in Nottingam stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the laboratory party, the meetings of the council on Friday night were just that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of a "sweet, humble" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It becomes increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the laboratory party, and each opinion is held in favor of the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to change my thinking completely and take positions that I would never have taken, whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I'm going to say, there's a critical abuse of the social media that calls for conviction, a rejection of the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have a great sense of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuse every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the lab party should practice tolerance culture.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with any demand for "less trust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I've got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud and then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I came into politics.
Just 32 years ago, when I joined the laboratory party as a student, provoked by the concern of the Tacher government that literally left my school to collapse, I fought to improve the public services for those most needed, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of conflict with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday's request, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Brigitt to harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the lab party leader.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momentum, but about my voters, whether they are members of the lab party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemnational threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will distract me from acting in a way that I consider to be in the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose — The Unsurpassed Air on the Top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this wonderful fun competition on the day of the Scottish Prefecture in Regby.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unfavourable side of the ten.
Eventually, everything is due to their superpowers, as well as to their improved chances of being used by the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our competitions so far and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Kristi of Melrose said: "The fire for Ear, they'd better use their chances than we have."
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for Voyors' game, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot acquired an unconverted point.
Climo delayed his lead by a penalty, earlier, just half an hour later, and then converted the salt point to 17 - 5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Nott, who had been carried out, and from the beginning, Ear continued to grumble with the point of Stafford McDoval, converted by Climo.
Earl's CEO, Blair Mcferson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose paid for the additional man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with unmistakable pressure.
But the home team returned, and when Stroan Hachinson got a yellow card to beat Climo without the ball, McFerson is pulling a tacduan from the back-side line from the sharp attack on Ear.
Climo converted, as he did back almost from the beginning, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's shot and sent the wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kiran, appears to be ready to move to the hospitality industry after it was found to be appointed director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, on which he's a screenwriter and plays together with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
The duel announced that the next nine season would be the last and it seems Kirnan is planning for life after Kreglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source said Kirnan is trying to include in the "successful restaurant trade" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol in a hidden, la Paz Marine headquarters.
Public buildings set a sea blue flag.
The seabeds from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are anchored with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to come back."
Among the land of Bolivia, the mention of the shore lost for Chile in a bloody 19th - century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in the decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course a positive outcome is expected," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of native origin, facing a controversial fight for reelections next year, also depends heavily on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge for Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge for them.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the judgement of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the past four years, Bolivia's cause may have been reversed rather than improved.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday would bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open the era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutual disparity," he said.
Kalsadija also rejected the fact that Morales, another of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among the rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey was working on restoring blocked nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and statements of the United States for the declaratory end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Tramp, want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about rejecting the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest shops near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection drops or completely block the sun, then do not ask for further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of too large hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the fashion week in Paris.
Finally, unpracticed hats started Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eye of the track.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge victory hat decorated with a wide variety of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other large additives included cirrhosis, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarous masks, and just in time for the Night of Witches.
Many of the colorful masks had twisted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecturer than high fashion.
One creation looked like a fully-fledged nailing equipment and a nesting tube, and the other looked like a cool corned ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of style predict that huge hats can come to the shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the broken hat with a half-wide two steps that take all from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind too much unpractice hat spread through social media sent another great creation on the track, a slender beach bag of almost the same size as the height of the model it drew.
The dark orange ruffie bag, with a ruffie board and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of the Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylisticist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding results of the studies, which only reinforces with individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community perceptions.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement custom school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as a school subject.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak with a man in a language he understands, he will make it appear reasonable.
If you talk to him in his language, he'll hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s studies, we can note that languages are overcoming all other subjects with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages achieved a higher 5+ assessment.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher estimate of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt gain in the future.
Languages now, as an object of choice, are seen at the same level as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in programs at independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The OC's Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 noted that for the reasons why employers failed to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs in demand for languages, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give priority to the policy before competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 OC adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and the French was the only language spoken over ten percent, that is, 15 percent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to its language.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when they are viewed in the future by 2020, as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a number of languages from which to choose in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing the learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country's future, so this must be re-examined in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"It must be done well" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debit in San Diego on Sunday.
Waiting's almost over for fans who wanted to see Lebron James starting for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced James would play in the first race in the preseason week against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But for a few minutes, it's still not decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game season before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the preseason at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's meeting in West Virginia
President Donald Tramp started a series of meetings as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five scheduled tramp meetings next week, including visits to popular places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of his election to fill the empty place in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Tramp's evening meeting in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Tramp meeting in Villaning, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 afternoons. Eastern coast time zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting in West Virginia via the Internet with a live YouTube.
This week it is likely that Tramp will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, who has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct by the expected postponement of the Senate vote until one week, while the FBI's investigation takes place.
The primary goal of the series of summits is to help the Republicans win the round of elections in November .
From this point on, President Tramp's campaign said these five-minutes next week are aimed at "impression of volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Convention control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many allied countries as possible with the start of the campaign's hard season," Tramp's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed, said.
As scheduled in the Wesbanko arena in Willing, tonight's meeting can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Pittsburgh media, according to the news of the West Virginia Metro.
On Saturday is the second trip to the Trump of West Virginia last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisy that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hyder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes alive at the beginning of the individual competitions on Sunday
After three single seasons, the four of you on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what he needed at Cupto Ryder.
The reverse of happiness is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these games.
To whom would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have advantages, of course, a leader of four points and twelve more games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the ether, although they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each reached three points of four.
Spy was excellent and led by example.
Those powerful challenges of celebration became ever stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the equation of four-four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His strike with which they won the 15th was expected with a similar summons, as he tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deeper and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that's left to every player right now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of Cupot Ryder.
The strange, but beautiful duo in Europe is four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
Molywood was the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who win this week and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun goes behind Le Golf Nazional, except for Flitwood or Molinari.
You prefer the two at the same time on different holes.
However, talks on European glory remain unjustified.
Buba Watson and Web Samson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
A missed strike and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they never got out.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two pairs and four are so fascinating to see from the close because of the interaction between their partners, the advice they give, the advice they fail to obey, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership in the last day, but the fourth season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, were suspicious.
Europeans led 10-6 on the last day of Cupot Ryder
Europe will enter solidly in the last day of Cupot Ryder after Saturday lead in double pairs and four from 10 to 6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods was struggling to take the lead so far to Le Golf Nazional on four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was fighting to keep the trophy lost in Haseltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans gave more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but they could not reach the leadership.
Jim Furick’s team needs eight points of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called Molinari, after the sensational weekend, are the second couple at all that won four points in the first four contests in the history of Cupot Ryder.
After "sucking" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and won the exorbitant Woods and American beginner Bryson Desambu with an even more expressive result 5&4.
Woods, who went through two swords on Saturday, played great, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning double pairs lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner to the four with a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans were not all after them that pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas put in place a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Puller in the double pairs and returned later to win the Puller and Rory McClroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost the initials, two holes.
Only two times in the history of Cupot Ryder a certain team has recovered from the lack of four points in an individual game, although as holders of the title, Furick's team had a sufficiently uniform result to keep the trophy.
After two days, however, the Sunday attack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says there's no way to unarm itself untrustworthyly
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are deepening mistrust in the United States and that the country is not able to renounce nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, demobilizing nuclear testing facilities, and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the US." he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to access to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongjang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Tramp at the first summit to the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim was committed to working towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Tramp provided a guarantee for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to let go of the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament in the face of everything" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The assumption that sanctions can not kneel down is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a mess."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he said before the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles towards the American land was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "Raketer" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Tramp, which was threatened last year with the "complete destruction" of North Korea, much more grateful Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Tramp said he had no time frame for it, saying "Do you need two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue fully and without exception until it is fully confirmed, finally nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the margins of the O.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he had made progress, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to a meeting with Moon this month for the disarmament of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "adequate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "adequate measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees Tramp gave to Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all diplomats more to sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women's Hospital Brigham, is designing the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after holding a talk about the influence of insufficient sleep on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, last year?"
She said no one, never told her the importance of sleeping - which surprised me," he said about telegraph.
The course that was first offered this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes, and improves the overall well-being.
Paul Barera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The simultaneous course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student’s home where students are pressured on coffee cups, curtains, ducks, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how inadequate sleep affects athletic performances and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart and brain damage, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Chazler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to pass into a mode of hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old student from California in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chazler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course in the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Chazler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "the blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which replaces the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal is to beat Gerard's men.
Rangers endured another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Stephen Gerard's armored team to the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibrox team wanted to register its first victory after the 4-1 February triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team put down the second defeat on Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the fledgling Harts team in the Scottish first league.
Manga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and opportunity to balance.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingstone's on the third floor, and they're just behind the hybrid according to the difference in the head.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical help due to head injury after he was obviously hit with a distant object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semifinal of Cupto Betfried.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 of Livingstone who won the Harts point last week and would be happy in the way his well-informed position smacked the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated possession over the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
It was supposed to be a point, two minutes after the beginning of Menga's first play, when Scott Pittman passed to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a far-off blow from Kehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their last-third game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he was supposed to get a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Loules had a dispute, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two holes to the goal in the first half, but the former Iberux Golman Liam Kelly didn't get away with the hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak hit of this Edaria.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half time he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the substitution had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his block line.
But Livingstone managed to attract the host players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Hackett captured many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor put himself in a good position and stopped Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner.
Retirement of Rangers, Glen Middleton had another request for a penalty after he had fought with James, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanah: The Hedgehog counter's invention
And now one side of our German "In the Week of the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REMEMBER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gajger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger numerator.
Since then, it has become the main focus of science, and it has also become the main focus of popular culture, such as in the 1950s, "The Layer of Colorado", in which these seemingly incredible, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a giant numerator, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Gieger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immunological system to "look" at isolated cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immunological system to "look" at isolated cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize isolated cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their laboratory changes
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the organism.
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize isolated cells, the cancer of the ovaries has disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extraction of immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "look" protein honor at many types of cancer called HER2 and then return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the American National Institute for Cancer from Betheda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaryum, white lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach with withdrawal of immunological cells from patients and their "learning" as to target cancer cells works when treating a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp exit, wearing a drop with his motto, after a performance on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was noted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which US President Donald Tramp was missing and said he would run for a function in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, wearing a cap with a inscription to make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
On Saturday evening, a live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star was laughing at Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, in connection with the charges of a sexual assault by Christine Blecie Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of the West incident was posted on social media by Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to ridicule West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the public that he had a hard time going behind the scene because of his drop.
"After the scene, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They mocked me!
Then they told me I was in the basement, he said, according to Washington Exzeminer.
The news went on: "Do you want to see the bottom?" said he would "put on his superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted dissatisfaction from the audience at least twice, and the evening show team seemed embarrassed, Varajeti reported, one man said to the publisher: "The whole studio is taking over."
West was brought as a last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with the performance of the song "I love it," dressed as a bottle of Perier.
West received support from the TPSAD Conservative Group leader, Kendis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for being at the top."
But the host of Karen Hunter's show wrote on Twitter that West was "his own and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (with the purchase of his music or his clothes or the support of his "artificial" which I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formly known as Caine West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, known as Paf Didi, Paf and P Didi.
Comrade Rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the lost musical legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol, and then into an artist from a previously known Prince.
Indicted for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder since he kicked a man into a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakmore, the police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The star of the Thrones Game series, Kit Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a skilled matchmaker like John Snow in a violent, medieval, fantastic series of Thrones Games.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
In a statement on Sandey Times' culture, Kit said he believes that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #SegaQajam.
Kit, who recently married the star of the Thrones Game, Rosie Lesley, also 31, admitted that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we make mistakes with manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic manhood, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of the male?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
'Cause it's obvious something's wrong with young men."
In an interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Tronov Game when the series ends next summer, saying "ends with battles and horses".
As of November, Kit will take place in the restoration of the true West of Sam Shepard, which is a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that what he met his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing the game, a character who had a love attraction with the character of Kit, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The two were married in June 2018 to the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% leap in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are occupied in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events have been transmitted through sex, which has changed since the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied the information issued by a member of staff related to the Republican party's senator as "hazardous lies" and "theories of a conspiracy"
US Representative Maxine Waters rejected on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff has published personal information to three republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed that the claims were "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"Laughing, lying, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes home address and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech from Juta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Bret Cavano, nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The information submitted appeared shortly after Cavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstreet have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the publication is related to the Waters office and information about the staff member of Waters has been published, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information that has been made.
Unlucky accusations are completely false and are absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted internet criticism, including the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Flasher.
"These niggers are nervous," Flysher wrote.
"This shows that it has no temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
She can't be challenged.
He must not question the accused's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the democracies associated with Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the mid-term election, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office informed "the relevant institutions and police about false claims.
"We will enable the offenders to be found," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
Thinking of Johnny English Attacks Again - Undermining Rowan Atkinson's spy fraud
It is now traditional to look for Breggzit's elements in every new British-related film, which seems to be valid for this refurbishment of the falsified, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Will the careful self - examination of how clearly we are about nowhere be the new opportunity for the nation’s exports?
Yet, the face with large eyes and many cracks on the uncompetent Johnny English has been given a license to "supply" things the second time - his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range made for cinema viewers in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamorous little-like Cluzo, has drawings on Mr. Bin and a part of the boy playing a note from the Kochi song on the fire of the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
His foundation is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who used to be in Barclis's forgotten TV commercial, leaving a mess behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's feathers hit on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission and themselves contain comedy elements.
Humour seems to be intended for children, not for adults, and for me, the crazy accidents of Johnny English aren't as inventive and focused as those of Bin's Bin's character atkinson's.
The issue that has been going on all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker has infiltrated the British spy secret network, revealing the identities of all British field agents, to the disappointment of an agent who is on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance of a prime minister who is a more hasty and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political impotentness: Emma Thompson gives himself in this character of Quazi-Teresa-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are several good boys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly called at Whitehall on an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a commander of a submarine, a comical role that Vicki Pepperdin has not been well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, they go back to action and meet the beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: evil Jason Walta, starved by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their stay of absurd actions: pretended to be waiters they're burning a French restaurant; make a desert after they're turning themselves into the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when trying to use a box of virtual reality to meet the interior of the Volta house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as nice and loud as it is, there's a lot of child TV in the entire movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with other films with Johnny English, I can't think of it: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will use his talent?
Labourers deny that British plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will think of a radical plan that British people will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three - day weekend, but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "corresponds" with the party's economic agenda and with the country's plans will be more inclined to the workers.
The four-day work week transition is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to have gains from economic change.
A high - ranking member of the party said of Sandy Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published by the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a work week of four days is an effort that is in line with the party's accession to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party was engaged in a four-day work week during the parliamentary elections campaign in 2017.
However, the aspirin is not accepted by the whole labyrinth party.
Labourist Party Portal said: "The four-day work week is not a strategy of the party and the party does not consider such an idea."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the last week's Labourist Conference to present his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "personless directors" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labourist government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans of employees to become part of company boards and to create inclusive property funds with which 10 per cent of the capital of private companies will belong to employees, who can take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Gram, John Kennedy is making a statement about 60 minutes to see if the FBI's investigation into Cavano can rethink them.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano postponed the final vote on his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least one week and updated the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could rethink some Republican senators to withdraw the support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open than his co-worker in South Carolina.
"I think so," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, indifferent."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a stone slammed.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavano and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it energetically," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blake Ford.
"All that she calls them couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual music event held by famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held seven times, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants have to fulfill several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, phone call or other useful work that will help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizens because they have 12 years left to reach the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel they make a real difference by signing an Internet petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" of supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to announce dedication and strategies that have gathered more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected directly affect nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, the partnership of investors and implementants, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children to exploit their potential", which promises to provide $35m for Rwanda to help about the country's inadequate food after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of insecurity, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food said, in front of the assembled people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were taken up in connection with calls to improve the diet of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced financing of the project, the Power of Ispranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with birth control.
As a response to one of the frequently asked questions on their web site, "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
From Global Citizens, they replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey — at times we will not succeed.
But like the big civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we're going to make it, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists that will take place at this year's New York event, whose host will be Deborah-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, as Washington Exzeminer quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- the name, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is being stopped to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is to market energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes will remain open and if the blockade is necessary to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki is addressing the events organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the role and fuel exchange," he said, while speaking to Russia as "one unpleasant pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after the Trump administration launched a mission to stimulate exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Tramp administration officials, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project for the North Tek 2 pipeline, which, according to Tramp, made from Berlin a "consultant" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Tek 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
Kremlin claims that the strong opposition of Washington to the project is just for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude was opposed by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy acquisition," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" whether to run as president in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run as president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the town congregation in Holioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for the president."
Warren appreciated President Donald Tramp's work during the meeting in the city meeting and said he "leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a message on Twitter Friday, Warren said "we understand we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not be running, according to a study by the Center for Political Research at the University of Safolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting potential nomination, and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known names from the democratic party that are discussed for nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sara Pilein is talking about Trek Pilein's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Tramp's meeting.
Trek Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he reported in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"As my son passes through, as he passes through after he has returned, I know how the other families that are torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds with which our soldiers are returning," she said in front of the audience meeting for Donald Tramp in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pilein called the arresting "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "are returning a little different, they are returning firmly, they are returning and wondering if there is respect for what they and their friends of the air force have given to the country, and every other member of the army has given it to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of domestic violence with a female attack, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of arms under alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Vasil.
18 Allied States and the City of Washington Supports a Controversy of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen allied states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new American policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims who flee from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday as support to an asylum seeker who is contesting politics, En-Bi-Ci News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Gray case against Parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics, has not been found.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but the US authorities rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender, who represents Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from where a large number of asylum claims in the United States are generated as nations with persistent gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy nullifies the 2014 Board of Immigration Complaints decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender, Washington Carl Rasin, said on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of bringing laws at the level of federal and international states".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request, and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Moreover, the defenders in the letter claim that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public defender Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who were fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshns said in his presentation of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people all over the world face every day.
A desperate rescue effort is being made in Palu because the number of victims is doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her male baby in the evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes and choose from their objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Salsy found it in his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was pushed into the urn of the wall, so I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador blames China for "dispatching" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-party advertisement in a US daily newspaper counting the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Tramp spoke of China Daily's paid supplement in De Moin Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - last Wednesday after accusing China of being involved in the US elections for the November 6th convention, China rejected the indictment.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections meant alongside US services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish promotion advertisements for trade, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that balances import tariffs with each other.
China's revenge rates at the beginning of the trade war were directed towards EU exporters such as Iowa, who support the Republican Tromp party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former, long-term governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandad wrote in a column in De Moin Register's Sunday edition, "now doubles abuse with propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"After the desecration of the propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the unguised American tradition of free speech and free media by posting ads in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you won't see a true reflection of the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" to the column, although he did not say what newspaper is being said about.
Republicans withdraw from women's votes before the mid-term elections, due to the debacle with Cavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans do not see or defend Brett Cavano's nomination in the Supreme Court, despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue to vote.
There is no going back from such things," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University in Siracusa, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flyk (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called "Nomvri is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hall, when the Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to continue with the nomination of Kawano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blecie Ford, Mick said.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to En-Bi-Ci news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Kawano will go to hearing, it's about how the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps in the election of democracies for the news channel.
Yet, the Americans are divided about whom to trust after Ford and Cavano’s testimony, even though a larger number accept the first party.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Cavano probably or definitely lied when witnessing, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one more, on Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee, under oath last week that Cavano attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses her of showing her genitals at a party while studying with Jeil in the 1980s.
World Network Designer plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Li, the world network inventor starts with a start-up business that claims to be a Facebook rival, Amazon and Google rival.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on an open-source solid platform in Berners-Lei.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "internet data repository" or a reduced POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, mailing lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluck, Slake and Spotifai all available to a browser at the same time.
What's unique for the personal Internet data store is that only the user depends on who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal backup through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several development programmers with a project work agreement and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available to the Inrapt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a media release, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet through the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent times, Berners-Li has been an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A well - known Victorian crossman of the first world war
The only Anglican priest who had received the Victorian cross during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belgium and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had received the highest British military rank.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the distinction.
According to London's Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de San Quentin "Niz very dense fog and under a strong fire of guns and mitrals".
He later ran to the places from where he was shooting and, with "the greatest courage", moved forward, before attacking the gun nest and decapitating three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I will never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make him humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wedding after the parade led by the Brandwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
The fans of the combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Prase
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have a chance to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards that were displayed all night long in Britain on Channel 5.
On 6 a.m., only Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were prepared to face, the British audiences remained exhausted when the channel moved to Pepa Prose.
Some were not impressed after they stayed up until early hours because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the transfer of a children's cartoon film as a "some painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m., that content was inappropriate, so they had to be transferred to a children's program," said Dave Schwarz, Vice-President of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Pepa pig," yes"
Belator Scott Cooker's president said they would work on a schedule that would include Britain's visitors in the future.
"I think that when I think about re-launching, I think we can probably find a solution," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning in the week and we won't be able to find a solution in the week after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer, and nothing was kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we went over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Disks on the empty island: Tom Daily felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking on the first discos show on the empty island of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular chairman of the long-term Kirsty Young show took a month's rest because of the disease.
Appearing as a parallel figure in Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else while growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-brown medalist became known supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without a divide and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time World Championship said about the love of a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley made a marriage to the dissident, who was 20 years old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much early age" -- he went to the first 14-year-old Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the gold medal in the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Dale said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held my hand when it stopped breathing and when it actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized it was invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming of all my life -- to jump in front of the home audience in the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - pride from Heather Small - that turned his head in preparations for the Olympics and from which he was still struggling.
The disks on the empty island of Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikkelson, the horse is not in shape, was at the club during Cupot Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he's going to have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Mikkelson, who plays the biennale, recorded 12th time, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furick during the Saturday double pairs and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as often represents the United States, the five-time winner, he divided the time to immerse and exercise his game, to the extent, with the hope that he will fix what is clean.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nazional playground, where the distant rough hits a regular punishment in neglect.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, confronts British Open Francesco Molinari's exact champion, who plays in pairs with beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who miss four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mikkelson's game can be judgmental.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understands the role he had today, hit me on my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the famous and has been given a lot for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think of him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's how it went, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Mikelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played matches at Cupot Ryder on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Kupot Ryder where he never reached the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven and a half, although Furick said his presence brings something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, sensitive, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun playing with him, as was this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in front of individual competitions in the last day of Cupot Ryder can easily be turned into an uncomfortable position.
The Danes debated at a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the target line only with the noses", with a minimum lead of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Bruklein, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a little bit," said Bjorn, the picture after watching the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 on Le Golf Nazional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play properly.
This is not over until the race is over.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy and focus on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent -- the best players in the world."
He added: “I don’t want to give too much credit for that.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are expected to play the individual games, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills are tested as a golfer.
That's the message to be sent to the players, to give up themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should give everything to himself."
Unlike Byrne, opponent Jim Furick will ask players to play better individually than they played in twos, excluding Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day's changes, because he was part of the winning team in Bruklein before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united players before the last day.
"We have 12 important contests tomorrow, but we want to start as early as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle competitions.
We set the line properly and the team's order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of resisting first and facing Rory McClroy's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to act this way with the guys because I think that's how we will cover everything," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German military ship has been postponed again
The German Navy's latest cargo was to be delivered in 2014 to replace the obsolete warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Rainland-Falc, the leading ship of the new class frigate Baden-Wittemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Di Cait, calling on the military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the problematic questions after the delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Vitemberg ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful top, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and marine missiles, as well as some static technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is the porous maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will be already obsolete as they enter the service, notes DiCait.
The F125 crash reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and return it to the Blam and Vous shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the sailor returned the ship to the shipyard after the shipment.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a number of key "software and hardware failures" that caused the warship to be useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Vitemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the sailor's ability to add upgrades to the future.
Rainland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be a double burden on similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the problematic hardware, the price of the entire project - including equipment training - has also become a problem.
It is said that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - an increase of starting €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important because of the warning of Germany's reduced maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "removes ships that can be deployed".
The representative said that the problem had worsened over time, because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but there were not safe ships for replacement.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Vitenberg frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Lilies
A new study of properties in the Scottish mountain ranges is being carried out to find out how the lilys use the limit in their search for food.
There is hope that the discovery will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in the conduct of future protection activities.
Studying the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano lily, as well as the brown lily with long ears and daubenton lily in Inverow Garden in West Ross.
Special filmmakers will be placed at key locations around the property to track the lily activities during the season.
En-Eich-Es staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all the photos will determine the frequency depending on the type of purple.
Then a map will be developed with habitats to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the border.
Rob Devar, an adviser to nature protection in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of life are most important to the lilys and how they are used by each species.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of habitats, and the best use of forests for lilys and other associated species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects the beds and the loss of habitats.
The veterans and the lights are also at risk, as are the sticky fly strips and some chemical treatments on building materials, as are the attacks on domestic cats.
Lilies don't actually get blind.
However, because of their nightly fishing habits, their ears are more likely to be used than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the lilys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even founded the first and only lily reserve in Scotland of the property Triv in Damfris and Galoway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"This is where we have a great area for lilies in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about the lilies, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He points out that it is important to check whether there are lilys before property renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 women and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and it is illegal to kill, torture, or harass or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in Trust for the Protection of Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about lions and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected charges of rape, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, who announced the charges.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus are accused of rapeing an American named Katherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 in order not to discuss the incident, said Der Spigel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video of Instagram to its 142 million followers, several hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right." The player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek damages for "moral damage by the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the charges occurred in June 2009 in the shadow of the hotel and the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents submitted to the court in Clarke in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped under that "one percent".
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that images of her injuries were made in the hospital, but later she agreed to a deal without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he's now looking for a change in the deal because he's having traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100m euros.
Brigitt: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Bregzit, business minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota-British told Bi-Bi-Si that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border stops in the case of Bregzit would cost jobs without an agreement.
The factory in Burnston - produced by Toyota Auris and Avencis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about the functioning of cross-border trade when leaving the EU without an agreement, including Honda, Be-M-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-M-Ve, for example, says he's gonna close his mini-fabrik in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without agreement.
The Toyota production line works according to the "precisely on time" system, where the works arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be an interruption to the border which, according to the industry, may cause delays and gaps in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory in the Derbishire factory, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We need to have the best agreement that will allow us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity," he said about today's Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
It could not say how long the production would be stopped, but long warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Covalaris, who has been working in Burundi for 24 years and is a representative of the trade union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "As far as my experience is concerned, once these jobs are lost, they will never return.
According to a government spokesperson: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Tramp's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House said
Donald Tramp's important meeting with deputy public defender Rod Rosenstein can be "deposited for another week" because he continues to fight about the appointment of Brett Cavano as a judge in the Supreme Court," the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, which investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Tramp's assistants and Russia and the potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Tramp will fire the deputy public defender and thereby endanger Miller's independence, he's been calling for talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But by publishing the reports last Monday, he went to the White House in order to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he "would not want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a dispute with the Senate's Justice Committee in which Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blecie Ford.
On Friday, Tramp issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the Kawano complaints, which will further postpone the Senate vote.
Tramp Sara Sanders' press secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date of the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going, and I always try to keep the press informed properly."
Some reporters object to the claim: Sanders has not been briefed on reporters in the White House since 10 September.
The leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the "great influence" of TV journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Tramp and the media be increased.
"The president organizes several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has a direct opportunity to ask the US president questions, it is far better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace the briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in private press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
EU Health Secretary working in Scotland's national health system about the fears associated with Bregzit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and their desire to remain after Brigitte.
Jin Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government is already committed to covering the costs of resolved EU citizens status applications that work in lower-level public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of a failure to reach an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercromby subjected to an emergency after having suffered head injury
Kristion Abercrombi, a defensive player (linebacker) of Tennessee State Tigers was subjected to an emergency after he suffered a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury happened immediately before the half-time.
"He came to the side line of the playground and just strung to the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen out of the playground, and then put it in a suit and carried it to a further evaluation.
Official representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center medical centre.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the nature/level of the injury" and "Tennessee State" trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays her first season in a red dress in Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five fights on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Thori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide access to housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds boosting the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, along with the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property for renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by individuals who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which has led to price increases and has caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to be involved in this property purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of offering high prices of the property they keep the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the quotas for accessible homes to remedy the "hungry housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive domestic reforms, including housing controls and ending immigration without a valid reason.
He also wants the councils to give greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister to the return of the British dream, or life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run with Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the Scottish national club.
Scotlandn, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently in the third place in the first league with only three points less than the club on top.
This summer he moved to the "Station of Light" after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B hat and that was it," Ross said about the Scottish Sports Sound of BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and always pulled me back.
However, I could only get this opportunity if I'm successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Advokaat, David Moes, Sam Allardiche, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he previously rejected the offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is appreciated by "can I bring this club back to the prime minister?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he certainly belongs to the Prime Minister of the League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've made a success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which a career took place after working as a chief's assistant in Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coach's staff.
Then he helped Alloa secure from the third league and returned St. Mirren from the loss of title in the First season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls at the assumption of "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as a manager was the right choice for me, better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because it was going well, I made enough of it, and I enjoyed some high-ranking.
However, building a career as a player can be very difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I’m still going through certain things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in this role than ever in my adult life."

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but which puts a greater pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars have seen growth in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants have decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the company "CGA" for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "The time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants decreased significantly.
The fall in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which alcoholics are mainly sold have seen much greater growth compared to the previous years, unlike the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is mainly sold were also badly hit by the sun, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sales of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a vacation analyst and receptionist from RSM said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to the sale of the market outside the home.
It is no surprise at all that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly devastating as a complement to the current pressures that cost them.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of places where food is sold mainly, and time would show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed breath."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the stop in the publication of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales tracking device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operational groups with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and represents a determined repertoire for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret profile on social media that hides from their parents
One study showed that one of five children, of whom some are only 11 years of age, has a secret profile of social media that hides from their parents and teachers
Research into which 20,000 high school students were involved showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles
The news increases the fear that sexual content will appear in such profiles
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" profile that shows their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, creates a social media profile that is hidden from adults.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
The news raised the fear that sexual content would appear on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that they showed their parents, and then they had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile found a teenager who asked others to "force him."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is a secret.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics committee.
Elid Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics committee at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of this sport's leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience achieved over the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and world athletic community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the committee," Bithy said.
Doyle said: "I am prepared to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help in the proper direction of sport in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 meters in the Atlanta Games in 1996, despite the total of four gold medals in the Olympic Games and which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after he suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I received a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether I would hold back or to what extent.
The whole process was unbearable, but I was able to secure it completely, I can go back and do some agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
A breast pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows causes a division of internet opinions
The breast pump production company caused a division of internet opinion when it announced a advertisement in which mothers coming are compared to cow milling.
In order to mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's most innovative heart pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie announced a funny advertisement inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to the mothers who are receiving it.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of song shadow whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed this doesn't come true, these are my breasts."
It goes on to say: "Push, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook the company's country caused internet controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it highlights the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"It is really a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like we should be pregnant and born so that they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children steal from them in just a few days after they are born," one of the comments said.
The "Elvie" breast pump is discreetly integrated into the breast implant ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Indeed inappropriate advertising."
Others, on the other hand, defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "miracle."
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd have bought a pump like this if I'd still come.
I felt just like a cow because of the slander.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the commentators voted.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement intended for mothers who milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "bloods."
This doesn't say what's missing or condemning the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they danced while discreet pumps were stuck in their building.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milking pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding garden, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while they milk the milk.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR in Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk and milk cows, we wanted to milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that we brought to the center of attention, showing the incredible feeling of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and close way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children migrants in detention has increased significantly, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own country if they asked to be a child’s sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a high immigration and customs official last week, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of minors without membership.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested have no prior criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the handling of children, the authorities introduced new rules that some of them would be required to appear in court within one month after they were arrested, not within 60 days, as security workers say the previous standard was voted on.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not on their own, in order to bring their case into legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which may lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape, the workers in shelters and reports that have appeared from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger objects such as Tornillo, where because of its size there is a greater likelihood that the child will be disturbed by the signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can increase the traumas that most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
The museum, which also acts as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally resided in the territory of Syria on grounds of their participation in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to lead this world's battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war was reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting a Tampon zone in the last major rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee made up of government members and the opposition in order to prepare a fair constitution for Syria and open the way to the elections.
Mualem identified the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "viewing members of the current constitution," and warned about the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Tramp will win second term
According to that logic, Mr. Tramp will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted by an impasse and scandal, most of which are probably hoped for by the Liberals.
In what will no doubt be the "Nydramatic finale in the presidency that has ever been seen!"
Watched from now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact rate has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that "Fox News" on average has 2.4 million visitors at the time of the strike, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of "MSNBC" reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million visitors at the evenings when important news is reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it's not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the leading television producer of the drama "Designed Survival" of "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol is destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovell, a veteran in the writing of comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Tramp.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skowel told me.
There's also a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the source of "deep back" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the bomber's leather jacket by Paul Manafort of $15,000 (the "dark arrogance," as called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Tramp's shocking anatomy by Storm Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a reality show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brant Montgomery, chief executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" for the rolling team of the Tramp show and daily turns (carriage with the NFL, praise for Kim Young-un).
You must not allow yourself to miss an episode because then you will not be able to compensate.
When I visited Mr. Flees this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Cauai, but he was locked in and watching "MSNBC" while recording "CNN".
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Influx of foreign funds in the most difficult Middle Ages race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress Area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganisation of the congress areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed coastal area in Pittsburgh, the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who took place in another area of extraordinary elections last spring, is running.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rottfus, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were manipulated for the benefit of the Republics, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns among key sponsors of the parties, the Congress Committee on Democratic Party's Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Party's Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th Pennsylvania convention area held in March, which was characterized by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has conquered the area with 20 points.
Political experts give little advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then he quit.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under low pressure by Washington.
Mr. Tramp in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tromp's organisation's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heder Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made at the beginning of this month.
But only in relation to El Salvador were punishments taken into account, which received US assistance from around $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high rates of unemployment and killings in it.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thought about the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their positions were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who was also talking about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that might happen is to publish a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Tramp, for which there is very strong evidence at the moment in public records.
Mr. Miller reportedly also directed his investigation into the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaigns were linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Tramp will have to bear responsibility in that body while preparing to appear again before the voters, and perhaps before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Tramp's fall is inevitable, not even on his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a state strike on Hitler if the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed in that, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unmistakable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans are now facing a number of such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Tramp resigned from Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's fate?
Rosenstein was on the hot table after this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly to record the president and speculated that he was inconvenient about the function he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information published in The Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if Brett's new investigation by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible charges for sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the elections for Congress who will accuse Mr. Tramp?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don't think that's gonna happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath table with the flag of the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of Rankers with optimistic attitude in front of the Rapid Vienna match
"Rangers" hosted a race with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and then realized that after the game won an unsolved match against "Villarreal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over Austria will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in League Europe.
Graham Dorens, a middle-class player due to knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a jumpboard to larger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
We might have been able to do a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did everything we could in the second half and were better.
Another great European night awaits us Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened — my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor in the place.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear of pension savings
Although research participants had a clear view of the way they wanted to be cared for, few spoke with family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they talked to their mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Animal Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how such choices can be a major factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term funding choices can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with your own funds, if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the very beginning.
Take full care so that you can entrust the person with the confidence to monitor your medical care and to ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Think, too, about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to carry financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" asks Martin.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from his departure.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expecting to increase the number of victims.
As a result of the interruption of the communication, the aid persons cannot obtain information from the Dongala district, north of Palo, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epidemic.
More than 16,000 people from Palo were evacuated after the disaster.
Following several key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of the narrow Gulf of the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area that extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the coast of the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
The county, which represents the administrative region within the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel is also an important activity in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also, tsunamis struck West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is found in the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6,8-degree earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis to destroy the southern coast and killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 - degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawaj islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to 10 metres and destroyed dozens of villages, and then killed about 300 people.
2016: Earthquake focus hit the Pidy Jaya District in Aceh, where it caused desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily arrested.
Sara Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasil, Alaska, was arrested in doubt about family violence, interference in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-su detention facility with an option to exit if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "innocently innocent" when asked how he was explained before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-class breach, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 cash penalty.
This is not the first time they've been charged with criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the vet court of Alaska is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, mixed in the report on family violence and possession of arms under alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by the veteran groups in 2016 after saying that her son's violent behaviour stems from the PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulavesi, located north-east of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Social media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York where eight people were killed, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a home depot truck in October to carry out an attack on the West Side motorway on the lower Manhattan road and to cross the pedestrians and bicycles that he found on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov " purposely" killed the eight victims and " purposely" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to seek a death penalty delivered in the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is the possibility of a death penalty on both of these grounds from the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand jury filed an indictment against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of re-requesting, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
"Detailed planning and thinking," the prosecutors said, in order to carry out the attack, in which the way Saipov performed it described it as "grossomourous, harsh and insidious."
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused, hurt, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernán Ferciu, Herman Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's report on the intention was announced.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since there was a fatal death case in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Kalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to two years in prison after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both were sentenced to a death sentence with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack, according to the court documents.
The police said that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing the video of ISIS on his phone.
The police also said that he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Paton, one of the allied public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt and expressing a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all those involved in it," Paton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
MP from the Tori Party says NIJEL FARAZ should be responsible for the Breggsit negotiations
Nigel Faraj today during a protest at the "Tori" party conference, he promised he would "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "see the heat" of the Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's MPs proposing to be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon on the march to Birmingham said the United Kingdom would so far "be out of the EU" if Mr. Faraj was secretary to Brigitte.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs May in terms of bringing together her deeply divided members was highlighted by the members of the Tori Party against Brigit, who joined a special protest against Brigitt held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite attacks by pro-Brecit people, counter-Brecit people and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party members to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to Pro-Bregzit the Leave Means Leave assembly in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the plan from the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be included and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU so far," he said.
The Ambassador of Velingboro added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan from the Checkers."
Expressing his attitude against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars for now to be subdued.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to remain in the EU is absolutely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the "Tori" and pro-Brecit party, was also present on the march and told reporters: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Checkers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists, who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz of the assembly said that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to deliver the decision that was made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bregzit, and we're here today to tell them that "we don't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit people marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists who wore banners with the title "The Toys Against Brigitt" appeared this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference on the party's application.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing called good Brigitt," he added.
Warren plans to think well about the candidacy for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will consider candidacy as president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe announced that the Democratic Party's representative from Massachusetts was talking about his future during the city council in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Tramp, will be running the re-elections in November against the Republican party's national representative Jeff Dil, who was the chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was in the centre of speculation that it could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holioc was her 36th meeting with voters after Tramp came to the presidential office, whose maintenance uses the format of a city assembly.
One of the representatives asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, including putting women on top."
Arrested suspect of the shooting and death of basketball Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rož, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect for shooting and the death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Diotion Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Way Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Marfi J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247sports" said.
Wade was involved in defending his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present at the scene of the crime, possessed weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and imprisoned in the Paris police department East Baton Rož.
As a senior 192 cm high who grew in Baton Rose, Sims played in 32 matches with 10 performances last season, i.e. on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 scored matches.
Grand Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders secured the victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the orders of the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
Of the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the seat while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
The Vetel went into the box first and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to have a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced Ferrari's driver to leave the interior of his free risk to remain side by side after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to reach the finish and reach Kimmy Raikonen, taking the fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came to fourth place.
It's a hard day today because Walter's done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has made a truly exclusive decision to have its two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad speech on the body.
President Donald Tramp mocked Senator Diana Finnstein at a meeting on Saturday about her insistence that she had not published the letter from Christine Blasi Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's testimony directly before the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "serious and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and ruthless and dishonest," he said.
"When you see the announcements and leaks of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diana Finnstein, have you published this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
To Finnstein was sent a letter with information on the allegations against Kawano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Finnstein denied that the flow of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't publish her story," Finnstein told the committee, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what I asked."
However, it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same Saturday meeting: “I will tell you one thing, it was really a bad speech on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, shame, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who's going to have to bend back to their power and control," the president said, as mediaite says.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the match against Dundee
"Dondee Stars" succeeded in losing the game under the elite league on Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 win in Dandi on Saturday.

Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host in front of Dwyer to return the leader of the Giants.
Francoa Bushar equally for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season under the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning in the previous three competitions.
Chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with Kendall McFol's addition, which addition was secured by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Sullivan provided the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart to assist Kauni to achieve the result of 15:16.
The two take care of Giants taking the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned with a powerful game and goal, with the result at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nilsen for the first time to provide Dundee's leadership in the contest late in the second period and he secured the victory of his team in half of the last period of the fifth match .
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday at the Milton Kanes home field.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on the plane escape the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared since the great earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to ravage the region, and many are trapped in hurricanes in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues escaped to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower of Mutiara Ces Al Jufrei Airport in Palu, which was constantly going down.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with flight number 6321 which was then on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"This news broke our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the urn, until many can't even even access," the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
The dams that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are carrying supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother said of Sky News: "The quick help carries the body every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and directed the national army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that a man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated by the plane that was ton.
The Air Niugini announcement said they could not find the male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
On Friday, officials announced that seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the precise order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to cross the water that reached them by half and go to the exits for emergency cases on the plane he was ton.
He said that the stewards were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that marines working near the port reconstruction also helped to save the ship by transporting people to the shore before the plane to sink about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents of air companies registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have been included in the Air Niugini airline.
Analyst establishes a time frame on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rovlet said he received information about the location of several mobile phones showing that Teleis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger said.
When on the basis of the data it was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that that day was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew for a week.
Rowlet said that some time after the death of Chambers, Telis erased the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to defeat the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in his music.
"The High Breed" from Bristol claims that the hip-hop is far from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their life through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?
New York's dad sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York father sues a married couple for being fired on the basis of discrimination after she has received a wrong message from her mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied that they were racist, saying the lawsuit was actually "a extortion."
Linsi Plasko-Flixman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out she was a black woman.
"NeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THE OTHER THINGS," Mrs. Plasko-Flackman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After she realized what she actually did, Plasko-Flexman, feeling "uneasy" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly, African-American baby was doing her job badly and that instead of expecting the baby to be from the Philippines, she announced "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the marriage couple and seeks compensation for the $350-dollar release every day for a period of six months, a commitment that will involve her living with the family, which was originally committed but without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she said on "Post" Friday, while adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges that they were racist, saying that Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared that they could no longer trust her after being insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think of.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"But would you trust your children on the face of what you were rude, even mistaken?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying the lawsuit was "a challenge," Plasko said his wife had just born a baby two months ago and that she was in "very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemns the social media’s marriage mate, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a sword that speaks, is revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the enormous success of Padington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration to write the book from a small toy in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60-year-old edition of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to be ashamed at all," she said.
"But, because you felt it so real, it was almost like having a child that has achieved something in life: and you are proud of it even though success does not owe you.
I think padington's success took it that way.
Although it was about the creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always attributed his merits to the Padington himself."
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were foolishly trying to save her life.
"Now you called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that she will not survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Tashie, I really love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased, and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems are giving up.
I just had to sit down and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, or I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay sheltered."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head on, and the tears didn't stop.
It was hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women set up bridge maps to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris are putting cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everyone remembered him after his smile.
People always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother who was then 11 years old was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid that this will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis draws up the cards "to give others the opportunity to know that there are people out there who can come back and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Hamfris, who is a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark with whom she was married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the day of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look at them at all and establish no contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “This is something that upsets the family.
It leaves us vulnerable.
But we must continue to fight."

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain after the FBI has launched the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, or researching with limited time, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "is falling apart" on the condition of the incorrigated partial idle state.
Why didn't Kawano and his supporters of the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their flexibility is solely due to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on 6 November, and if, as the Republicans are expected to face failure, they will then be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their person as a member of the country's highest court.
George V. Bush called the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Cavano who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can have at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, enabling Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea is "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Byong-seugue, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year there were 1,127 crossings on the border compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates of human trafficking are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, where the longest border with North Korea is found and which can be more easily crossed than the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China views these people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in war, has improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the halt of the denuclearization negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Riya Yong-ho accused on Saturday of sanctions imposed by the United States of stagnation in progress since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Cavano "historic" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kawano "historic" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not but think that if a woman acted that way, she would say it is "histories," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kawano before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the allegations that Dr. Christine Blasi Ford had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional at his introductory presentation, sometimes even shouting and sneezing while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling them "grostic and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Cavano's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown himself to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think that it is disqualificating itself with those statements and the way the Clinton family and the Democrats were attacked," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to get Cavano down if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is concerned about the possible convictions that Kawano will bring against the Act of Access to Health Care or Roe against Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Cavano did not answer the questions as to whether he would nullify some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really severe criticism, months and years of collecting anger, which she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She went on, “A woman who had performed an executive job somewhere, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she told the person what she was talking to, ” she said,“ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
The tears are allowed as a ventilator for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where the men dominated was when I once started crying with indescribable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager of whom I had always had a certain fear, caught me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patrick Schroeder was a Democratic Congressman from Colorado during that period and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a married affair on a ship called Monkey Business, he withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not thinking about running for the president.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said 30 years later in laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched long ago, it did not have enough financial resources, so it promised it would not enter the race if it did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who had given her men $1,000, would give her only $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech he announced she would not start a formal campaign she was so overwhelmed by emotion, or gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that it was so hard to collect funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you've seen me, you'll probably think I'm having a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder of how the media reacted to the case.
"You'd think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my record.
"She cried?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire at the beginning of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and even though the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Tramp, president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by exposing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation was significantly escalating this week by introducing new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), making half of the goods coming to the United States from China effective.
Beijing was returning to nature each time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same in the near future.
Making Washington withdraw means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too ashamed of Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing, conditions can be created to start a sudden economic downturn in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research co-worker focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, which is a tank tank.
Syria is "prepared" for returning refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and makes efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country are now provided, which they have to abandon because of terrorism and the economic measures that have been imposed unilaterally, which have reflected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the U.S. team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained its grip since Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, turned the ball into water in pairs 3 to the 16th hole, with the loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was highlighted in all circles, with one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the tournament started to be organized in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost score 5:4 from the lowest ranking player of the European team, Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranking player lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, which may have been the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Serhio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European player who won the most titled tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we got our title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," emotional Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He now resigns the seat of his coroner John Ram, who on Sunday one won Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a result of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost in all four competitions in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's about amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 big titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team all weekend was trying to focus the game on low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-quality golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick after the disappointing game of his team said "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
During one period this morning, we made it difficult for the team in Europe.
We were fighting.
He's digging down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit them.
They beat us.
