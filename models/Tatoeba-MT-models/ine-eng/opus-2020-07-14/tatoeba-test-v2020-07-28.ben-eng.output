Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop yelling.
He doesn't have any unfinished business.
Do you have a bigger wind?
I thought this book was interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love to run.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.

Are you all right?

Can you understand French?
I'll be back in a while.
Tom says he'll give up.

The kids love to do it.
It's too bad for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's it worth?
How long is it today?
Bye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My dad likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apple.
Didn't you buy it today yesterday?
Eat the bread!
It's not true what you said.
They have two girls.
Is there a way out for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch Tom.
How much is the price?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom's out.
How are you?
Tom guitar's really good.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll come back later.
Tom Mary ruled.
Don't open it.
Come on in.
Tom's teaching me French.
I'll think of something next to you?
Then there's trouble.
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my last birthday.
Where are you going, Tom?
I need a treasure hunt.
You have to eat the cheese.
Who can you take a shot one day?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's obviously not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all yelled.
It's too late.
Give us a break.
I didn't get a fever.
I had a fever.
Don't wait.
How long did it take?
It's us.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so calm?
Eat whatever you want.
Rome in Italy.
Tom, it's hard.
I can handle it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I'll never let you do this alone.
That's how it's said, the roof of Mount Everest.
I sat down.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his face up.
Tom's dead.
Tom was crying like a kid.
Let him go.
I can't identify someone else from one planet.
I read your book.
Nothing happened.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
It's a long way from Tom Mary.
The kid's shaking.
I've got to sleep.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, nine, one.
And read the book in the evening.
I won.
Take a deep sleep.
I won't do it.
Good night!
They're all screaming.
There are many branches of science.
No, I'm not, you!
See the bikers and the roadmen!
You always complain.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You'll have to cut tickets when you're on the bus.
It's not hard to learn French.
I'm cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Speak in front of your face!
Everything okay?
Linkon died in 1865.
We've failed.
How many rooms do I have?
He's not here yet.
You're looking for Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
They're going down, Tom.
The hour of the church has passed.
Let me go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have two twins.
Do you have a car?
You're very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bike?
Now the most important thing you can do is to be calm.
Where's the shit store?
Look at Tom.
How many nights will you be?
I'm going to school.
My throat's a little dry.
I have a new red car.
You're begging me.
Watch Tom.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to go."
You're not the first person to tell me that.
He's eating.
Tom's in a good mood.
Doesn't it work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Deke me.
Do you have a car?
Are you eating meat?
Is there any other way to go there?
No one's doing this here.
You're not paying attention.
Can you bring Tom around?
Take it.
Please accept my heartfelt apology.
Do you have something to tell me?
I can't understand you.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I accepted her invitation.
Is Tom okay?
You're a doctor.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
What are you doing?
There is not enough one language.
Don't move!
They yelled.
My dad's always mad.
Tom wants to catch an empty fish.
He's close.
I like him.
It was important.
Tom had her eyes closed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom's been trying to figure out what's going on.
How many people do you have in your party?
You should sleep.
I want to bring Tom here.
And it'll be ten years in April next.
Tom's still in bed.
He knows where we are.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
You can eat whatever you want.
I've been working for three years.
Tom was there.
You run.
Give Tom a kiss.
We can't sleep for a word.
He can speak French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
Got it.
Tom's not happy about it.
I like her.
You're big.
I don't want to go to sleep.
My mother likes music.
Is this the way to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Are you eating meat?
My bodies are shaking.
Can you watch Tom?
Can you play piano?
Look at Tom.
Today I got a call from Tom.
Listen to me.
I want to buy the rings.
What is your name?
Don't shout!
This river is going to the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you screaming?
I love to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this alone?
I saw him run.
I don't want to eat anymore.
Consume yourself.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop persuading the lady.
How bad did you see a mountain in the back?
How am I supposed to go to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's shaking.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's running now.
I just found her home.
I promised you.
That's mine.
We're the winners.
You can eat whatever you want.
I can't find my wallet.
When did you leave Boston train?
How deep?
I ran outside.
I don't do what he doesn't do.
Here's your bag.
I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll try not to interrupt your study.
Trust me.
I'm sorry to be late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
What's the ticket for the music organization?
Tom was talking.
I'm your friend, right?
How long does it take to get to the train station from here?
Tom will scream.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll be back in 20 minutes to pick you up.
What do you want to be?
I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom tomorrow night.
You don't understand.
They're all clumsy.
Would you please be able to talk slowly?
What's your finger?
The woman eats the bread.
Tom wanted you to take it.
I'm done.
My father can fly the plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He's eating fruit.
Attack!
Tom screamed.
Tom said that Mary allowed him to leave quickly.
What about this book, Tom?
How long you are!
It's noon.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps?
I heard a scream.
Are you coming down?
I'm lazy.
Tom has lied about his age in order to get into the club.
You can stay as long as you want.
She's sleeping like a kid.
I didn't see it.
Do you eat meat?
I want to cut my feet.
Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
Your friend needs to remember that.
This item is easily expandable.
Can you please say what you said and once?
I fully agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He's running.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you going to fish with us?
How old was he?
Tom's reading me French.
I thought it was cool.
Give me some more water.
I love to go back.
I don't have to log out.
Why?
Tom's breathing very hard.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me, I've been waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit here.
The hospital is very large.
He's asking how it's possible.
I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
This is your turn.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw my mom's taking some clothes off.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What does this word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
Puzzle fun stuff.
They need friends.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Tom Mary was scared.
If he were to follow her doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't shout!
What's next stop?
Why aren't you coming with us?
When I go to the throat, my throat hurts.
I'm dancing.
We often eat together.
He's a doctor.
Is he American?
I'm so tired.

How can you be so calm?
The capital of Bangkok, Thailand.
Look down.
How old is the world?
Someone's here.
It's starting now.
He's trying.
You might think how I could know that.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here, too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy a book?
Do you know what he said?
It's a shame.
I'm playing right now.
Call the hospital.
I can't get the money.
Let me talk to you.
Open the door.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father's going to China.
I didn't eat.
Tom's lying.
Don't remind us in any way.
I'll be back before midnight.
Come with me.
Go away.
Mary's a very good girl.
Where's the hospital in the neighborhood?
Where's the knife?
It was a devil's trick.
I like black.
I'm relying on you.
Do you have a kidney disease?
I'm just kidding.
They yelled.
He's asking how it's possible.
I forgot to call her today.
I saw her wash her in the car.
Tom's out of breath.
It's less than me.
How long have you been in the woods?
How can I go to the station?
Tom thought the Tabizta would save him from the Dinny's hands.
It's easy for me to write about death rather than life.
I heard you scream.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He's not here yet.
My father's home.
Hey, look, there's a rabbit in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My dad's open.
I think you both know Tom.
How many nights will you be?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask her for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone was shouting.
Who's coming?
Tutari, Tom.
We're back in South America.
What is your favorite TV program?
They have a gun.
My wallet's in Dickie.
You really don't do anything.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
How long does it stop?
There's no one there.

Shut up.
Contact Tom.
I want you to talk to Tom.

He's talking.
What language is spoken in the United States?
I read English.
Let us in.
He gave a speech.
He's not here yet.

Would you like some more?
Seven's already gone.
I haven't been doing this for years.

Seven's already gone.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can keep my hands on the ground without shaking.
The police ordered us to follow us.
You're a doctor.

Can I get some towels?
It's not always easy to do the right thing.

What a surprise!
I don't want Tom to see me in that state.
He can speak French.
There's an illness that nobody likes to talk about alone.
Have you ever been Boston?
That's a bad look.
You can study here.
I'll call them once in the morning when I get back.
Come in two times.
I know Tom is tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll watch.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Get in touch with Tom.
It's snowing all night.
What's that under there?
I'll need a taxi in the evening.
I heard you scream.
I don't see you.
I can't understand what you're saying.
How long are you going to sleep?
You have to do something about it.
I'll pay you €100 a day.
It's in the middle.
Please make a little noise.
Are you out of your mind?
They're shaking.
Turn left.
I killed Tom.
The library on the left.
What does that word mean?
Mary's shaking.

Eat whatever you like.
There's no doubt about it.
Kids like cake.

Sit down.
Drive carefully.
I'm watching TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What did you bring?
He told me he was going to Venice.
Listen a little.
Can you breathe?
He's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom's sleeping outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's in the middle.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much is it worth?
How can they forget us?
I can understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What fun!
My book here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going Monday?
They're cold.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
Run it.
The train came as soon as we could, so we didn't wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it.
Come with me.

Try harder.
Have you ever eaten fish?
He's talking.
I like him.
How long you are!
I did my job.
I want my coat.
I thought so.
I don't like my body.
Where he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him run.

Tom told Mary he was going to kill himself, but he wasn't as brave as he was.
Are you going to fish with us?
Although this is not bad, in many cases, many watch more television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Take a look at the car.
I'll eat.
I don't want to go alone.
How far is the station from here?
He got sick at the end of last week.
Tom knocked on the door again, but no one was injured.

Stop raising.
My head's broken.
Go to the hospital.
The state angel came back.
Please move on.
The pen's broken.
Tom always keeps his word.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I deny it.
Wait outside.
I need a cab now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
At least that's happened three times.

We'll try again!
Tom, it's hard.
Don't forget us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm south of the north.
You're so tired.

Is the heart too deep?
I'm late.
Call Tom.
How much is the price?
I saw Tom Ona.
How long is your plan?

There's a hat on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get off this ship.
That's Tom.
He's not here yet.
Kim smelled funny.
I'm not in town.
Women have changed the world.
Take a break.
I don't want Tom to see me in this state.
Tom's starting to shout.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's going to cost €30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like yellow.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you screaming?
Can I get a check?
Do you have something bigger?
Tom comes from me twice.
That's what I need.
I don't think you need any help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's gone.
Are my London clothes made?
Where can I buy it from?
I need to send a fax.
He eats a little more.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
We're in Dakis.
The rules are simple.
Can you watch Tom?
Your condition is so much better than I am.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand me?
Tom was surprised when he heard that Mary had married another woman.
Most success depends on effort.
Tom's in a lot of trouble.
Tom blew his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows that now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Are you still reading this?
Do you have a hat?
The contact is offline.
Can I get a candle?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to name the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Is that so?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You ever ride a horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
How do you feel about this?
I didn't have to tell Tom.
Try harder.
Tom smiles.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He's got two girls.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everyone wants happiness.

You can choose what you want.
Tom was helping me.
Let him go.
Let's wait here.
How long did the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I can take time to do this.
Tom's keeping him.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some candles.
Tom Gayle's gone.
You go first.
We've had dinner all night.
School will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that under there?
A football game.
The sky is clear.
Namskar!
I'm really dating your gift.
He told me he was going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's moving.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I been too late?
Let her go.
I can't say right.
Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom before.
How long did the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you how much I want to say.
Snow reflects the excessive brightness.
Get out.
They screamed.
I ran away from home.
We made pancakes for the East.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Kaslen.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my baby food in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my speech.
Do what he says.
You're so tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always talks to her.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18th and today's Viriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell empty Tom to do this for us, don't we?
Can I get these clothes if I'm exhausted?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Someone's dead.
I went to Bacarita.
I learned to live without him.
My dad's very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I'm sorry.
We'll work.
He's here.
I disagree with him.
Come to me.
I'm kidding.
My hand-wheel is not working properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
I have to go now.
He ignores the study.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easily warmed his head.
Wherever he went, his dog would follow him.
Who's that?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
My desire to collect old bottles.
I like the score.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother can play very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop whining.
Was Tom there?
I was bleeding this morning.
My back's still hurting.
Where's Tom?
They seem to be American.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget Tom.
I think Tom said his name is Jackson.
You've known Tom for so many days.
I know.
I'm playing soccer now.
My client hasn't arrived yet.
Tom's not here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom doesn't even know what he's saying.
Eat something.
Is there anyone in the house?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where can I get the stamp?
I'm going to shave.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
And a little bit more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Arrest that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where should I ask my cousin?
We do whatever we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students who are not Japanese parents.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who will you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I wanted.
No one's in need.
Are you here?
Everybody else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you seen the guy in this picture?
I've lost my money.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son's getting rich.
The sky seems to be starting to rain at night.
How much will it cost?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those in the shed should not throw stones.
Why are you crying?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his hat back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm gonna eat breakfast.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city was divided by a river east and west.
Look at you.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tomo's playing guitar.
Do you have any idea what you're going to do now?
He's running now.
Can you watch Tom?
You need to ask her for advice.
This tooth is hurting.
How many of these lights do they make?
How much should you pay for more money?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Take a break.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't swim my right foot.
I'm thirsty.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Gajrosh likes Gajer.
You don't understand.
My mother's hurting.
Sit on the table.
He's smaller than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book is only found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I afford a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He had a black hat.
Anything else?
Everyone shakes.
Is there a drop for the students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask how they are, ask what they're doing.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He's eating empty fruit.
I want new shoes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
Tomorrow's rain, but I'm going to cut the sand.
My right ear is beating.
My father was busy.
Ready to go.
I couldn't catch the 70,000 train.
There were two of his daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
You want a drink?
The class doesn't start before eight.
How much time do you have to eat?
What does that word mean?
How can I find it?
Can you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is far from me.
Tom's father-in-law was a singer.
Here's your turn.
Tom's alive.
He's showing her in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're kidding.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's raining tomorrow.
When I'm done, I'll be back.
I like the bright.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Three men were killed.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's father is a hero.
Hey.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now's the time.
I never make a mistake.
Where's the door to the UA 111?
I'm breaking.
Why are you whispering?
Tom wants his hat back.
How much time do you normally sleep?
The country has edited a contract between itself.
I speak to Tom in French.
Tom Marlo's eyes.
Can you grab a little gift?
Tom's in the garage.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's smiling.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my manbag.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's under arrest.
Leave the city!
Sing to 3rd.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Did you see him grow up?
How much did the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Don't argue.
That's my kiss.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a fever.
We were on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom yelled.
Tom's in a lot of trouble.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane arrived at the right point.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were busy.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of balls.
Tom's running a lot.
He knows where we are.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Empty the Tom's candles.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay outside.
My mom can have a good dinner.
They're shaking.
The investigation was successful.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to keep the gold he's got.
Boston is a big city.
Me, too, 17.
Here's your key.
Leave Tom's word.
Eat your milk.
The name of the two of us, Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the filling?
Tom's hurt.
Go back to Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom Gayle's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not pregnant.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look at that.
I'll tell you what to do.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom's got his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue anars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to go to the kitchen with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll shake.
Everyone's safe.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuk.
When I said that Mary left town, Tom was really surprised to see it.
I heard a scream.
How long is your plan?
You don't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up at 8:00 today.
Please light the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours to translate some pages into English.
Are these yours?
Who is he?
Is this the least way to go to the station?
Tom Mary tried to kill him.
What are you doing to him?
It's impossible!
How long is Yokohama going to train?
How bad now?
Words that don't correct the correct ones, you can add more normal translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to have dinner for you.
Listen, does this train go to Washington Square?
We've failed.
There's ACE in this house.
Did you follow the whole thing?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The snow can come in at night.
I'm not proud of her.
Is there anyone there?
It's gone wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Are you going to fish with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was hurt.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
You can't see!
As soon as possible, finish it.
Use it.
How long is Yokohama going to train?
I don't understand that either.
I've been up for seven hours this morning.
I'm home.
Run slowly.
Good afternoon!
I'm in.
Me, too.
I'm not very busy.
It's very beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started on the roof.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are shaking.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'm going to give you on my birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you screaming?
Stay right there.
Eat whatever you like.
We were playing the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I'm done.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't come in.
We're lost.
Tom's shaking.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
She was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here's your mojo.
We don't do what he doesn't do.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're lazy.
Bills can be dropped today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's wrong.
Eat whatever you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
