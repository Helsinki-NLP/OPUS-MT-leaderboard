The Prague Stock Exchange fell to minus at the end of the trade
After the early collapse, the Persian stock exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange was tied right from the beginning of Tuesday's trading on its Monday break when it dropped by almost six percent.
This time, there's a drop in action on Wall Street.
This is how we react to the response of the market to the result of the vote of the U.S. shadow representatives who refused to support the plan of stabilization of the dark financial sector.
Ground of action in Asia
The dramatic fall in Tuesday was witnessed by stockpiles in Asia, even though the indexes lost a part of it during the day.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng storms accounted for almost four percent during the trade, but later part of the loss was reduced and the decline was reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which is monitoring the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8%, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually lost to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock exchange, according to the dark index, dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of a rescue action in the United States is unconcerned and affects the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines its monetary policy by itself, that is, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has an interest rate at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, the US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, it threatens to feel more like another country.
Bloody american action spatula
On Monday, the US Snow Representatives rejected the financial system's support plan, to which up to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion CZK).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush's challenge to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
The American action on Monday experienced a bloody spa and the main action indices recorded the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent and a similar decline was observed last year in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but once it turned out that the proposal had not been passed in the locker room, the index was left in the open.
Congress suspended: U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars to the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed in a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
We'll vote for him next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the adoption of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
But it's not saved yet.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the basis of the Snow White Paper on Monday.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters told the Banking and Financial Services Committee of Barney Frank.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan probably first in the middle.
Economies believe that the adoption of the rescue plan should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to reach in practice also leads to "strangement".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosiov√° told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should redeem non-trading mortgage assets from financial companies that bring financial companies into serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are under the final agreement of the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still necessary to continue in the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that decline rapidly.
According to Vice-Voice Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where the Congress' decision could affect Monday trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, or whether they can't engage in some kind of problem for the last time.
Lawmakers hope he'll be approved in the next few days.
But the law still has a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function, following another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
The President may vote on this decision, but Congress may vote on it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funds for the redemption of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, remains because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, they are preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The shadow representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the bilateral effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold falls
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, the closure of profits, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called gold falls for the directors of the company participating in the programme and to establish a committee to oversee the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is also calculated with the help of home owners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new salaries at the mortgage it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs of salaries for debtors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is based on the main economy of Patria Finance David Mark as a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"And because they don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will separate themselves," said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important according to Mark.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree this week that they support this plan and that it will devote it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at this time," Marek stressed.
Fighting sharp knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll figure out how to choose
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons for man to order a solo player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and charged.
You'll probably find it hard to get your home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
However, such music products on the LP boards do not originate and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if in your regalulas wined with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
It's the same with music on the roads, so music compressed, simple - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, as well as Pink Floyd fans may be difficult to test for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Determines battery maintenance
Some peak music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles don't happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephoneing and examsing, he can play music and video, both of them record, he has a better, worse camera, and he can even navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and the communicators down, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger on the display.
And playing music is one of the biggest hits of energy.
A tiny cell can play music for more than ten hours, most of it is much less.
In this direction, the music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more efficient.
Therefore, in cheap mobiles, count with the fact that you won't be playing for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you're calling there, go to work for security and get another charger - it's also for expensive devices.
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, and the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can connect directly to a computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a lot of cards will be able to deal with miniature memory cards that are used in mobiles without any reduction.
You don't need any special software for players up to the exceptions (iPod).
It's just a device to fill your music with USBs from your computer.
Most of the mobiles and players are already creating a music library sorted by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the need to evaluate the user.
Some devices only display the tree structure of folders like a Windows Explorer and some are both capable (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players serve power, mobiles become more skilled
When choosing a specific device, take special care of the battery maintenance, memory capacity, quality and sound output type, and of course also of control comfort.
If you have the music above all and if you listen to it every day only briefly in the tramway, you will have enough of any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which can really be almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch the music formats of your cell phone or player.
MP3 will manage all and a simple majority of the music that will be available to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most extensive and besides it, most devices can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow for for example purchase of online music.
Just go through the mobile Internet to visit the relevant sites of the operator (other than the provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a falling argument for the installation of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is bad and limits most of it only to a fast-paced hit radio.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will eventually affect the music industry.
Most people still wear their phones.
Whenever you get a taste of listening to something, you put your cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying in a forgotten home.
Still, it matters whether you're always wearing a earring or at least a wired handfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player who has almost every cell, but only a minimum MP3 player.
It's probably the greatest advantage of the music mobiles for a lot of price.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns you'll already have a very decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you will be limited to the absence of a normal listener.
The best, and on the technical site, the most equipped phones and with a 3.5 mm hole for the ordinary listener are up to 15 thousand.
The advantage of the players is, in other words, an easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum function, the likeness of control with a previous ordinary poet or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a faulty mobile Internet and then a huge account for data transmission.
After which to wash
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have a fair slot on exchange card (type M2, microSD etc.).
And by buying the relevant card, you can go to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported in the basic models.
Only the dearest ones can deal with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, download for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you're among the most demanding listeners, you'd better get on specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to a single MP3 player.
The first is in the Sony Ericsson field, whose mobiles from the series walkman have similar user interfaces as a self-sold MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery support (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will be arriving in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively successful and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make you survive.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that the common operators are even the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times already.
He also confirmed the fact that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming charges, it may be a paradox situation - for some Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic be kept so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that would really want to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to see that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (CHT√ö) President Paul Dvo≈ô√°k, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network has no more chance (in fact, it would be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - virtual operator.
The direct entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which the classic operators had to respond to.
At the time, even before the entry point like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile was on the market, there were similar voices in Britain as in us.
But it turns out that there is a place for such operators and they can really be successful.
We still don't have to walk too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of a virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Then behind Mobilking is Penta's financial group, which in Czech Republic owns other than U:Fon.
The benefit of virtual operators is an opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they have a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear with them relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost - offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by more services.
In this way, Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and bet on an uninterrupted target group.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Administrative guys like Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like Poland could be caught by us.
Vodafon spokesperson Miroslav ƒåep√Ωk: "The Czech market is relatively small for segmental access, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively saturated."
In Czech without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there's a virtual mobile operator in Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in Czech Republic do not seem too hopeful.
It is more likely to release Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studniƒçkov√° in a phone conversation with Penta's financial group.
She has just confirmed that the current mobile operators in Czech Republic are definitely not attracted to this idea.
Rather, he is trying to do everything he can to prevent any potential competitor from coming up.
The GTS Novera group is no longer interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 telephones on the company's field.
"We have a great interest in allowing our customers to offer not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with this option with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," says the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's a good time, then.
Unofficial information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, his creation involves an impenetrable castle of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is a space on the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
Until now, no entity with a complex and serious project in this area has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr≈°e≈à of the Press Committee Phone O2 stated in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also eligible for the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile speaker, Martin Kemrov√°, adds in a short line with the statement O2: "We did not record a viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone attacks its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav ƒåepsky says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we think of customers as the most affordable.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, would it be easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to things for operators, they're going to be able to take one train, they're going to testify to the Tahanics around U:Fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards ƒåT√π went at the time of U:Fonna from T-Mobile.
It shall bear witness to this publicly available information from the CTU website.
Now, however, the U:Fon is the argument why not allow the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov√° submitted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would be subject to high requirements and, above all, to its services."
However, due to this approach, mobile operators are directly affecting the interests of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only about the position of CTU, which unfortunately was in Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - that has no power to intervene in economic competition.
They are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But he's got his typical attitude into the whole of the problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator on a mobile market would be possible after the agreement between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure would have been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders is unlikely to be interesting enough for classical operators," Kristian Chalupa, from the Committee on External Relations, answered our question.
From the representatives of the operators, the statement so formulated will not be surprising.
From the authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, it is more than a matter of consideration.
In particular, when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually act, we can see that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment is likely to be low and prices are not in the interest of √öOHS.
In fact, the shock of the whole case is up to the touchdown of three mobile operators that emerge from their reaction.
The question is, if it's really just an accident, it's offered on its own.
Just as the exact price of petrol at pump stations is certainly only a part of the accident and a hard competitive fight.
"The Office in this matter has not sought evidence of a dispute, and therefore there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have adequate responsibility for their conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecoms are from a single market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator needs always the consent of network operators.
And a mobile operator - has a total logic - on its monopoly network.
So in a certain segment, it has to be dominant.
Even if we did not accept this argument, for UOHS, it should be at least warning that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) indicate that all operators are subject to very similar obstacles in dealing with them.
Evaluation of responsibility for ƒåT√ö is then in telecommunications a relatively common trick that √öOHS gives away from the whole matter of hand.
We've met with him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, to the recent adoption of the telecommunications law, the extension of CTU's powers in the field of competition in telecommunications has not been able to predict whether a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but they're probably interested elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one sees.
However, there are no exceptions to the functioning of some pseudovirtual operators that exist in Czech mobile networks immediately.
They are companies that issue their own prices for mobile phone services, which are only partially public.
It's usually about companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
This is how Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The pricers of these companies will usually only get to the chosen ones.
The shirt consists of the company's appearance towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company," answered Martin Kemr.
It is unlikely, however, that a similar activity would not be carried out to responsible people by mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators will be able to prevent such a procedure.
Therefore, from these companies‚Äô activities they have unresolved profits and, unlike actual virtual operators, they are in no way threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåep√Ωk points out the possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not managed on their behalf, so they cannot be fully available as normal customers of mobile operators."
That's exactly what should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for √öOHS is opened.
If mobile operators rely on a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that √öOHS has a relatively strong power to detect similar activities and, if he does not wish to, must not be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no such understanding and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the dearest
As it has already fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decline in service prices.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The arguments used by Jimi were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In mature countries, but in these moments, regulatory authorities have been affected, not by the interests of mobile operators, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and another one was packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are all over the case as a hot spring.
From our experience, we cannot escape the impression that the lack of clarity in their competences is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let's not run a flint to the grass.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator is really coming up with us soon, the Czech mobile market may reappear.
If some of the operators have created a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult to remain able to deny (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling the wire than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Select the best place to search
Listen to the four implementations of a new version of the Czech State Hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek, on the occasion of the Czech State's Day, presented a new recording of the State Hymna where my home.
Hymnu replayed the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in the congregation administration and instrumentation.
The song was captured by Catherine the Prince and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the ceremony are Otakar Jeremiahs and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The White House regards the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had already told the Czech public that he had deliberately chosen to sing the salt variant of the singer with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"From the beginning, I was at both and then also with the congregation trying to keep them clear, so that the text would be well understood, so that they could get together," he said.
The Czech State hymna will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home was first announced in 1834 on the slopes of Stavovska Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovak Josef Kajet√°n Tyla complemented by music Franti≈°k ≈†kroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
The first set of songs then became part of the State Hymno in 1918 after the birth of Czechoslovakia.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a single Czech Republic.
How "new" Hymna sounds
Prague MDD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers arrive at the metro, tram, and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this point, he can arrange about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (it will be paid since 1 January 2009) and at the same time let them record on their digital card in the info centers and workshops of the Transport Company in the stations of the Museum, Mƒõstek, Nadra≈æi Holeshovice, Angel, Roztyly, Lett≈àany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° garden, Kaƒçerov and Luka.
The coupons can also be purchased on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
Service in the afternoon was used by over four hundred customers.
Those who start using the Internet store can definitely forget the outlet window in the subway stations where they had to be regularly on long fronts on paper trucks.
The coupon is purchased via the Internet and on an Opencard card it is recorded in one of the thirteen local libraries.
"In these places there is a passenger transfer available with a trained service that will help interested people with online shopping and also record a coupon purchased on their map," said project spokesman Martin Opatrny.
In addition to the books, it will be possible to record electronic purchases on Opencard also in self-serving machines that are installed in several metro news stations.
How do the machines look?
They are red, they remind the riders and the travelers may have noticed them already at the stations of Roztyly, Budjejovic√°, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavsk√°.
"Now there are five in town, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," the Watchman added.
The coupon controls the location of the automatic driver.
The service of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert an Opencard chip card into them and the first paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic purchases from tomorrow are paid not only in the main city, but also in its surroundings.
So in rural trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which drive to the main city, the inhabitants of the medieval towns are mainly.
"In the trains included in Prague's integrated transport, the guides are equipped with carts to determine the time and frequency of coupons," explained Filip Dr√°pal's control of the Ropid organisation, which consists of Prague's collective transport driving rules.
Home buses have cards built in a store at the driver's house.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver a chip card, but also to add Opencard to a given place on the treasury side.
The driver controls the validity of the charged coupons.
"If the traveller needs to verify the validity of the charged coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not drive by urban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires may return to self-serving machines where the purchases are recorded on the map.
Here they will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of devices.
The judges wanted the US referendum.
In 1945 the Germans applied for the involvement of the United States of America in the Forest.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the Jihoche scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Germans allegedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
It follows, among other things, from a letter that was kept in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the Jihoche Scientific Library.
Germans from Czech Krumlov ask in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of the "shuwab County" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly sure of the words that the American units come into German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in a letter, signed by "People who lie in the judgment of Shuma on the heart".
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia is reportedly giving to the Soviet Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only of brutality, ignorance, ignorance, oppression and slavery, the author of the US President's letter asking him to take over the protectorate for the present and the present times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would recognise this territory to us as a foreign country that is exploiting and expelling minorities and nothing, without contributing to the conquest of the Union," the letter says.
The reason why authors can't sign is probably the concern of the "Cheese pushers".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans, he had enough to hold a referendum in the forest parish on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today‚Äôs knowledge of the war stories, some memoirs say it is appropriate to conclude the then expectation of the Germans.
Although the common Germans had to at least be aware that they would be removed from the Republic, only a few of them allowed themselves to do so.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudan some form of autonomy.
The others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Buddhists.
He was for war like a Buddhist German on the Baltic coast.
When at the end of the war, the British took him and placed him in the Soviet camp in Holsht√≠n, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach the Czechs.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would be allowed to walk in the mail," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Bene≈° decrees.
You don't mean you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Attacks the Driver
The most expensive action focused on road safety in Czech history.
It would also be characterized by an emotional media campaign that plans to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Ale≈°e R√©b√≠ƒçka's office promises to run the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flights.
She's supposed to get the driver out of the fast ride and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to stick together before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, to professional drivers.
And what happens at the meetings?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And it also bears witness to the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't mean you'll pay!
The word "don't mean" is written in large letters on the priest.
And in the blood bag, the word "you'll pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of neglect.
The spectators will "fear" the meetings by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic images of the victims can usually be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The meetings were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and bull on the driver
"There's a system of sugar and bees on the driver.
Sugar for them is that, for example, if they go to red, it saves time.
The bull is a threat of plague or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist at the hospital at Homolce Martin Ko≈ô√°n.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and especially negative ads, my psychologist.
They're already less effective, according to him, a table that alerts drivers to danger.
"If a static table is installed to protect against danger, it will probably soon collapse with the environment and drivers will not commit to it," Ko≈ô√°n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in return for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, that is to say, pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that was published on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned, unless at all," Olmert said.
"We're leaving a certain percentage of these territories, but we're going to have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel) because it won't be without peace," he added.
He assumed that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and in particular does not want the tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Highs
Olmert also spoke of Israel‚Äôs departure from the Golan Highs, which he considered to be an unmistakable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require a certain effort from the Damascus side.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan," he warned.
"The sirens well know what they're going to have to give up to get Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shiite Movement) Hizballah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by terrorism (the Shiite Movement) to Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (the Holy Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a long bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Pads, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers could move on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally abide by the law, the work of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the transport ministry's spokesman Karel Hanzelk.
The accident in which a 12-year-old driver died last week apparently caused the driver of a truck that crossed the road.
The girl at the moment was unhappy sitting next to the driver, at the safest place in the car, although she has two more seats spared.
However, the bus can crash, or rush fast, even at a time when the driver broadcasts the coffee or newspaper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking space according to the technical indication.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Remote buses Student Agents do not have places to stay; which Currently.cz confirmed also the director of Radim Jancura.
"We resolved this with the ministry, and first of all, the movement of passengers was not allowed.
Later, they called and we got to know that passengers can walk in the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The Steward Law Does Not Know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legal provisions do not solve this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the driving vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," says Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Director of the Road Traffic Management Committee of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn√Ω believes that the problem of the law is sufficiently addressed.
"It depends whether the bus in the approval has a parking space allowed.
That ends it," he says.
Buses are divided into cities where the parking space and the maximum speed are limited, inter-urban with the parking space with the highest speed and the distance without the parking space with the highest speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The expert BESIP for transport safety Jaroslav Go≈ô√≠n in the movement of the stairwells on the bus deck does not see a major problem.
"With a very dangerous ride, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can hit its head."
"If, however, the bus rushes fast, of course, the physical laws apply.
Just like in the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by means of internal regulations," he says, and less so, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janƒçura is willing to cancel the service
A student of the Agency offers the service of the stewards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director shall not consider their call for risk even after the accident.
"As soon as I find out that the call for stewards is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get the passengers on their return.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the absence of stewards in their cars was justified by the director of Asiany Alexei Litvin, who operates a break of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been standing against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with some fatal growth," he said a year ago for Week.cz.
A Tragedy That Became Unbearable
In the case of a link connection to Naples, a young driver from Plze≈àska died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck is likely to turn off without using the direction from the distance and block the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid the fast manoeuvre, but he lost the right front part of it.
To be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards, Janchura refuses.
"This place can't be booked in remote connections, they're blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the courtyard, but the financial reward is also expected by the guilty party.
Edit the law?
Incompatibilities
A clarification of the movement of motorists on the bus deck could bring about a revision of the law, which over the year is being worked by a 30-year expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"There was no specific conclusion, however.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the road and use the mobile when running," says expert Hor√≠n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would, in a fundamental way, threaten the safety of passengers," Hanzelk concludes, saying that the security check of buses is in the power of the police and the employment security authorities.
Hope D√ºsseldorf is Frankfurt
A large letter from the WestLB representative to the employees of this bank is not missing.
By joining this d√ºsseldorf monetary institution with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank, "the central financial group's institutions will be set up for trading on the capital markets," let's read in a letter received by the public on Monday.
According to a letter to WestLB, this transaction is subject to a "competence set" that ensures a long-term return.
Such a connection can, at the same time, be a decisive incentive for further mergers in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when the representative wants to demonstrate the ability to act during the problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission but also on the part of the Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose country government in the North Westfales has announced that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know about for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talking for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, at the presentation of half-yearly economic results at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his home in Mainzer Landstra√üe with some of the country's banks, such as Helab or WestLB, he did not see any meaning.
The Deka-Bank Governing Council, which consists of one half of the Bank of the Land and the other of the Land, has, however, entrusted the representation by conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks just started, the financiers submitted.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3000 employees, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the disputed sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it could be possible to merge Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Helab.
There was no end of this triangle.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen Land government spoke against the participation of the Bank of Helab.
Neither of the remaining banking houses did that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg from Stuttgart instead.
However, speculation about the deka-Bank connection with the country's banks has been repeated.
In recent times, however, G√ºnther Merl, chairman of the Bank of Helab, expressed negative thoughts on speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that regardless of this, it shows the belief that the approximation of different banking homes in the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country snow in Bavaria, the BayernLB could begin to paint a connection with the Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg.
That's not exactly the good news for Helab.
If the pressure on other fusions is to rise, there are gradually possible partners for such mergers.
It would only play a second puzzle in the south, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, the association with WestLB was again banned by Svaz Sprijtelen and the jury banks of Hessen-Th√ºringen, which had a 50-and-twenty-one share in Helaba.
That's what the North LB would look like.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are, however, only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl announced that the decisive question which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, the German association of the Spouse Banks and the jury banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with a WestLB deployment that, of course, no one in this institution believes.
That's why the letter from the Dark House also speaks of trying to "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to Deca-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of October is known as "the weekend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luc, the third or the fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and then everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, at the 5th Court of the Kaiser brand, there is a stronger hunter and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest show how deep tones can release his throat.
Elena Luc is gonna dance first and then she's gonna love him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses with the name "destinazione Monaco, party della birra", are expected to arrive at 6.30 this evening.
Three buses contain mostly Italians, on one bus they drive exclusively to Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans sing with their flag, they're celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
A Marc, who has a long coat with a skin-like flipper and glasses with wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
He's been riding with them for five years at Oktoberfest, only this year he's having three trips.
In the night, in the day between the beer stands, at 22.30 a.m. back.
Overnighting would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road is 75 euros, including the welcome beers Kaiser, which was established according to the Bavarian law on the purity of beers, health insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses go to night, along the highway towards Brennero.
Beer's not allowed, not yet.
The bus is very quiet, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well. They're still gonna need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where on the 8-piece distance before Minikh is another stop and many other buses with an Italian flag.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe, according to the plan.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to Marc's internet address, travel office: "conscersiviaggiando.it".
The second is, "When the door is opened to the beer stand, run away!" says Marco to the early air.
"Go!" Go and hold the seats in the back of the condition.
"Not before you pass, and not all the yellow caps on the same sheet, spread around the space!"
I got 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the sloppy ones.
"Show the Securitians that we behave properly.
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone."
The third is, "Be here again, this evening, in the middle of the 11th." Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, room with beer conditions.
One member of the group wears yellow caps as marks on trees, cedars and even on the election poster of one large bavor side.
We need to get ready for the retreat.
As a weekend with Italy, I know the second weekend of October.
Detailed information on the number of visitors is not available; it is about fifty thousand of those who are on their way to the Alps and fall into beer conditions, ten percent of all visitors this weekend arrived from Italy.
The order of the Munich police will strengthen seven South Tyrol policemen, the Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (approximately 60 attacks) and the Raku≈°any (approximately 80) with about 200 medical treatments are the first place.
It's particularly popular with the Italian state of Hofbr√§.
Unusual nights for believers Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Finance Minister of Peer Steinbr√ºck stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has included in its claim the fact that the German banking sector will not remain in crisis development.
Because it was the last weekend.
The index of Dax, followed by the financial house specialising in the financing of the property Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive loans from the German bank consortium of several billion to protect against turbulence on the market.
The person informed of the situation on Monday said to Agent Reuters that the said loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The fees will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
Money is derived from private and public banks.
There's a loss of Depfa's daughter in the background.
According to a news report on long-term projects on which he borrowed money, this public finances have been refinancing extremely short-term, which is no longer possible due to mistrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve dropped by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Regular income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero last year, increased earnings and certain securities, as well as reduced lending reserves by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher return on the subsequent accounting costs of restructuring the former Depfa group and the return on interest under the tax regime and to the brokering of the trade for the group companies was the sixteen per cent reduction on the income side.
The former state finance officer, after his privatisation in 1990, burned himself on the mortgages for the farmers, who were then removed from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
Since classical state funding was too low, Depfa engaged more strongly in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to respond to something and these descriptions will have "essential material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been told.
The fact is, the dividend won't be.
By 2007, two thirds had been cut off.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financial partner for state and infrastructure projects since Depfa was taken over.
More powerful than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers practically cleared the bank's loan gap two weeks ago, as banks are monitoring liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate is needed annually for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros - short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for a reasonable period and the company is protected "before the impact of international monetary markets at the moment to a significant extent of incapacitated functions".
Other sources were heard that these funds provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in due time.
The Social Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured on the market.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and inability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be fully exhausted.
But you can't rule it out.
After the bank's late Sunday afternoon, according to everything before the insolvency, it can't be temporary, saved to calm the thirst.
The stock exchange fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they were well held by the bonds.
While the preferential debts have not practically moved, they lose the course of other bonds more specifically.
This concerns, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of W√ºrttemberg Hypo and the logical bonds with the maturity period after 2009.
Hypo-Real-State bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be followed by a strong focus on the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which introduced it into the company by taking Depfa, to understand the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and the less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the value of the securities in their maturity.
However, it can also be seen that almost no one at present has any hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are coming at the same time as this partial withdrawal, the existing borders are likely to become only legitimate expectations.
This is especially for long-term believers, likely to prepare a series of well - established nights when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
In the short term, investors may use the margin to at least create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the short-term incomes of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the box bento
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day of high school in Tacibana, girls will start to cry: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mang. On her new blog about the exchange of residences tells about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already in school.
I live in the country of Tokyo, heading to Kawasaki and driving 40 minutes by train to the center of Tacibana.
I had to find my way by myself, and I didn't lose my luck.
It doesn't seem that the start of Tacibana's education is not given as hard as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students will start to meet in eight hours and 20 minutes before the ninth will start a short sitting with the teacher, called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I was supposed to introduce myself.
At the same time, I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, but before the class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took my old dress from my host mother, to that blouse, blue underwear and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajonara Wo also Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls in the class would whisper, chichotal and macho and I would still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I've already known that from my maggots.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and it means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I got into my place fast.
The girl next to me had quite a smile, she considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gang called, I was literally asleep.
They talked through each other and chichotaled and asked me about possible and impossible - and then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, about the breakup, they all got their guts out.
My host mother also made me such a box for lunch - which is something other than boring German candles.
I had rice with herbs, small pies, salads and raisins, fruit and some sort of fish in the tofu cake.
Most people don't even know what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look special and taste pretty new.
It's true that everything's really good.
Well, maybe we should go to the salt-loaded sweatshirts, no!
Benta at Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a self-prepared bento, which in this case is especially regulated by the artist, and hopes that the boy in the kitchen knows about the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can see it here, too.
'Why is Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, habits and habits.
And you're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
And the rats have feelings
When a rat or a frog escapes danger, does it mean that they also feel afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same way when they act the way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge" the contributions of well-known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in her series presents selected answers to the question, "What do you think are true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else can prove that we can't even prove that they have other people of consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start to devote ourselves to another species and open up questions of perception or general awareness, we enter an inconvenient area because the hardware does not match.
When the crisis gets in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, crushed, or attacked.
People are treated the same way that some scientists do for comparable subjective life.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animal life.
However, it is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side frontal cortex (due to its short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primitives, and it seems to be lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other things.
Another dramatic characteristic could hide the human language: because it is so much of his attitude associated with language, it is often said that his mind depends on it.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if knowledge of the language did not matter, it would certainly affect the language, so that the animal‚Äôs knowledge, regardless of its design, would probably differ from most of our opinions.
So it's hard to find out what it looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not even possible to measure, because of the special hardware, to analyze us on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in front of major problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of consciousness, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientific power available.
It would be possible to examine the processes of animal consciousness regardless of their content, and that is exactly what is happening in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick devoted to is more focused on the neural roots of consciousness than on causative mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontier cortex for visualization.
What's the feeling about that?
I export them from the fact that the emotional system, like the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are marked by primitives, especially people.
In conjunction with the language nature, there is a fine detachment of perception, because using words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize the states so that we can write them by ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from the more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain region, like Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could have a peaceful share in the feelings of the many animal disasters that have taken place.
Theoretically, I can't resist it, but I think it's unmistakable.
Panxeep argues that what appears to us in the rat and people like fear is likely to feel the same way: How can it be verified, says Panxeep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave the same way?
He's feeling fear, too?
From my point of view, it is not just the same behavior to show the compatibility of living.
It's true that the neural comparison keeps us going: the rats and people have similar brain stems, on the contrary, not the brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to a person: how would we want to prove it to the cross?
I think that rats and other frogs, maybe even clean (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circles and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of the cross.
Anyway, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing for the rats and people.
Like the cross, I don't look at language and knowledge, I don't even know how it feels, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to be short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than throw myself against the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
It just started, and there's a lot more to do in both countries."
In the timely implementation of the timetable for construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests are choosing.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work as quickly as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Federation Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep watching us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN was revoked after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent manager Robert Zawlockim.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miros≈Çaw Drzewieck.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," said the Polish PAP press agency Drewicki.
"The UEFA President Michel Platini's letter assures us that this step will not lead to preparations for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were convicted only in the past season for manipulations, and eventually the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Encouraging Dennis Quaid Returns Attack
She wanted to advertise a new film, she talked about private matters - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorce.
The one that's burning and returning the strike.
The late war rages with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are leading an unfavourable dispute - in front of the public's eyes.
Meg Ryan said in his interview with the American magazine InStyle last week about the reasons for her marriage: "Today has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it has been very painful."
She knew about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The emphasis for this mental stripper was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," said a 14-year-old artist from New York Daily News, that "Meg repeatedly survives the history of our relationship and corrects it".
It's also "politicizing" that to Jack's 16-year-old son again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father of twins.
He says, "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one current study in Germany, there were even less than 50 per cent of the price.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again improved - this is the result of a study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made since the first half of 2008 and found their significant decline in the second quarter after prices rose in the first quarter.
After several years the prices on the hotel market have grown, accommodation in many places has already grown.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored were still on average 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most cautious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less than in the previous year.
For the sake of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar course that has caused "the taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices was also more severely affected by the financial centre than the industrial centre, such as Hanover, Kol√≠n nad R√Ωn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of hotels increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
The prices of flights also showed a further upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the distortion of kerosene, passengers in the Economie class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, the fuel for long-term fuel was even 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in the Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 per cent increased, 23.6 per cent decreased in the second quarter.
In the German national years quoted in the study, prices fell even half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing down economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market does not exist.
On the other hand, there is an agreement on Open Skies, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased competitive pressure.
The sign of a tense situation is the settlement of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that issued a competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV Porcelain Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one bronze and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to make up a functioning eleven.
He wrote Kristofer Klein - to increase Unsatisfied landings for representatives of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game late and failed to hit the ball on the tip.
His message was accurately formulated and conveyed from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in a walk to the Hamburg arena cabin.
A lot of this didn't happen in catacombs, the interval between half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys greater respect than many moments of actor.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant approached and took a finger to the sign of the agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Master Coach Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded the same: I'm here with the other head!
It didn't happen.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
And even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "desired more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgens thanks to Mladen Petriƒá's head (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladbasheds could not harm the poor Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates its existence this Monday for 121 years.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a vividly updated table on the video room in which their team was named as the premiere.
It's going to be a birthday without a good party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
Guess that the transient table result symbolizes the incalcibility of the league rather than the domination of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilian Nevese and Silvy, the Petriƒá and FC Bayern's winner - is slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more sense and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package resulted in a decrease in the Dow Jones index of up to 700 points.
It was the greatest point of loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow did something again.
Around 20.30, this world's most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% decrease of 10 579 units.
The Nasdaq technological stock exchange was with more than seven percent in the minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dowa at this time, the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost around twelve percent.
None of the titles have been able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the total amount should not be paid up, but in several stages.
In return, the State has to get stock lists of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the State budget.
Action courses in Europe fall sharply
The billion-aid to banks in Europe and the US investors are not immune to doubt.
The short action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly accessible and downloads the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing even through the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular short-term losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank scored the index of German shares (Dax) deep down.
The share of the said monthly financial assets has also been lost through the rescue of shares of the social government and private banks up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank has gained more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly closed below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent scored 5,839 points.
Action markets have gone to the knees all over the world.
In New York, he started a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government's savings package of $700 billion should not be sufficient for recovery in financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points of 3.3 per cent during the first business hour, and so 10 809.25 points.
The U.S. Snow Representatives will vote on a rescue plan, the Senate could speak on 1 October.
The other European storms were just one way: in London the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 per cent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index for Nikki dropped by 1.26 per cent to 11,743,61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18 286,90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex 506.43 was lost by 3.9 per cent, and the trade ended at 12 595.75.
In the MDAX, they lost after notification of an increase in Arcandor's basic name.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has registered 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook do not sell.
Dark mass affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of the advice of one mysterious phenomenon: the dark mass affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation beam).
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity should not be entirely correct.
Nearly 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew into space.
It's because of the fuel management that's going to freeze soon, now she's threatened to die in winter.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has affected the confusion - anomaly of gravity.
The gravitational beam is an aerial manoeuvre of space probes, where they gain additional flexibility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as the Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is that flying bodies are not kept to a degree as a person would expect under a good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes are speeding up or slowing down.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by anomaly of a gravitational rock.
Several experts are concerned that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the attractiveness of mass by distorting space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of gravity through so-called dark mass, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be a dark mass that could also be found very close to the Earth," she writes.
The existence of the dark mass is only known by space researchers for about ten years.
Its apparent gravitational force, whose effect on other universe bodies is observable.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light.
According to scientists, this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappings, according to the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt, tourists return to freedom.
Sudan prisoners demanded a ransom of several million euros.
At the time of the shooting before the release, six kidnappings were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The deal about the ransom is already in progress.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions on the Sahara are, according to all, free.
They reported on this in agreement with Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab television station and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to a report by the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and others have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides in order and in safety.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Kahiry.
The lack of clarity remains the background of the shooting before the hands were released: according to an Egyptian security worker, the kidnappings were prepared to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six abductions.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted employee said.
It's just, "it's just a matter of taking over," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, the Sudanese soldiers shot six prisoners and two of them captured.
Prisoners applied for a six-million-euro ransom for Germany; the money was to be handed over to a German wife in one of her arms.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with a call to one of the German brokers stated that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappings were afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappings wanted to be abandoned by women's husbands after the payment of the ransom.
Men should have been kept until the kidnappings had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Kahir refused to comment on this report.
The abuse of the father "leaded to suicide"
Several years of abuse by the father led a woman to kill herself, reported before the court.
After he confessed to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Treise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treise wrote in a statement.
The court also said that Ms Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes up and then abused her sexually while her mother worked in the hospital.
Treise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, it was announced that I had followed the example of the abuse that was inflicted twice a week on Miss Randle, who spent a considerable part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization.
Ramsey Quaife complained in court that in 2006, Miss Randle's friends, who were also very devoted to surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's been sued by an igelite bag.
Randle stood face-to-face in the face of his own father, who wrote a confession, which ended up saying, "I hugged her and touched her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she didn't do so, the case would probably not have been brought to court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime on their daughter in those years, according to Stephanie's parents," he added.
"It would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the Waterloo train at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were given to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is at least a serious crime against that law, and nothing indicates a criminal purpose.
BBC writer Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being settled internally between the Ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
An employee who is not to be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The coroner recommended that the Metropolitan Police officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown place.
Company reserves of debt B&B
British cooperative deposits may have to be set up with more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds.
These loans will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 social foundations.
The Director-General of the Association of Societyal Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "submissive", that deposits and their members must be paid.
A quarter-billion-dollar debt will finally be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest, which is arranged in the meantime, will pay every year to all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Bank‚Äôs Compensation Plan for Money Services Fund confirmed that all 59 social foundations are included in this item.
It's humiliating that these institutions, which were very careful... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not so serious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company was to pay in proportion to the deposits it held and that the deposits were to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that growth from debt in 2009 to 450 million pounds.
This means that deposits will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Societies, told the BBC that he is convinced that it is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have been seriously involved in the expansion of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so serious."
According to the BSA, no deposit since 1945, when it appeared, had fallen.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the opportunities to protect social security and their members from the account that could be significant," Cole added.
The fee due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid over the whole year and it could be almost twice that much.
In view of the fact that the shareholdings are participating organisations without shareholders, this account will ultimately pay their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk boils five pounds per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
Ms. Jersey announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk by five pounds per litre from Monday.
This year it is the second price increase, after double taxation in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consultancy company.
Retailers should decide on their own whether they want to reflect the distortion at customer prices.
Before the fall of February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk was last changed in 2002.
Deposits for the Bangladeshi expremier
The Bangladesh court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadzid for bail release, which means that if he returns to power, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused her bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained from a certain businessman over 50 million dollars (729,700 dollars) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against it.
Chalda Zija, a long-term political rival of Shah Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina has to go back to Bangladesh over the next few weeks, but her party, the League of People (Awami League), asked her local army to give her full freedom first.
The authors say that while she was released to the fair word in order to be able to take part in a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she is now referring to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court regulation.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the claim of Shich Hasina for bail in that he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an investigation for an honest statement abroad," her guardian Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We shall appeal against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so that she could return to the country from abroad for preparation for December elections.
The High Representative of the League of People said that Sheikh Hasina should return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army held by the temporary government took over, but was released from prison in June to allow her to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Ch√°lid Zija both reject all charges brought against themselves.
Fear of anti-defence in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not been involved in the recent global threat of armed violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations held a six-province waitout.
However, it says that for security reasons it was not possible to reach children in the south in Helmand and Kandahar.
The United Nations spokesperson stated that even through the Taliban's promises, he would not attack or defend thousands of occupiers at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV court dispute
BSkyB lost its share in the competitive broadcast of ITV in the review of the Commission‚Äôs decision on competition, which was ordered by the company.
The appeal court for BSkyB‚Äôs competition ordered that it reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission stated earlier that the share of BSkyB had dreamed of a competitive fight and had an disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a trade that, as a result of preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007 the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of ITV participation in BSkyB had caused doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to launch an investigation.
Chief of the Virgin Sir Richard Branson Consortium, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to disproportionate - mainly because BSkyB said earlier that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of the Af√© of American Lawyers
The U.S. Chief State Representative appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine US lawyers in 2006.
Tah came into the situation when the report on the affair, drawn up by the Chief Inspector of Justice, criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised the White House officials, the legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was raised with concern that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials have lied to the investigators during the investigation with a view to condemning justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious appeals, including potential criminal proceedings, were not fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to make witnesses speak was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Ministry of Justice dismissed nine US lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers had been released for poor performance.
Later, however, it was shown that the release of lawyers was not judged any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been involved in the struggle of highly-established Republican MPs and senators, while others have refused to investigate the accusations of fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers shall investigate and conduct proceedings in court cases outside the government.
They can be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The Turkish Prime Minister of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, got himself fired and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also declined.
The report by the Inspector General on the role of Gonzales in the affair was very critical, saying that he carried "the main responsibility" for the release of "abdicated" from his leadership and, in fact, "not necessarily engaged".
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rowe, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loafo's leadership will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will get one of the Q Awards prizes for its epic Hymno Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who, for his special gold prize, comes to the ceremony next weekend in London, said he was "honored" with recognition.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
This year's appointment is led by the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals that met Loaf provided.
It started an instrument piece that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in fifteen.
But Meat Loafo's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in a notebook for about nine years and sold to the world more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, a real name Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated due to irregular heart rhythms after he was on the podium.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later, it turned out that he had a cyst on his voice.
Obesity streets, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other terrestrial communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even a lot of vets and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, most of them because they've never heard of it.
This small street is in the district of East Village and leads north of First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like a walk away than a road trip.
There's no sign of the street.
In the ordinary atlas, it is practically invisible.
However, he has a street of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants Extra Place to redesign and create a cleaner transition to shops and shops that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are the longevity of neighbors who say they were cut down by the street just because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was destroyed.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of a Building, which has its own power, does not have the slightest interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Committee of the Regions, the representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan that would allow developers to buy the street.
However, according to Suzanne Stetzer, the Community‚Äôs district manager, 3 the Committee prefers this option when the streets remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"There could be proposals for correction and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that a small street wanted to re-send and sit in places to sit, some of which would use a cafe whose interest in renting the space is expected by the developers.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the building maintenance office, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and stressed that his office's task was to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small trail in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the big farm of Philip Minthorna was divided between several of his children and on that narrow road of the country no one made a claim.
To Extra Place, the back door was led by CBGB, a punkrock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most famous as the background of photography on the package album of Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
"That place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"There were full of waste, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about the exorcising of the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that one piece of public property should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place as rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah‚Äôs missionary in New York (with the title ‚ÄúBook of Arms: a bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of measuring), explained a part of the story about Extra Place from the talk about the city, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
Author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark and in the day and protected by the narrow iron doors of the warehouses and closed windows, where the old newspaper is spent a week in the machinery."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening seemed exactly the same.
The cross went through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today there is a trade with expensive clothes.
There were graffiti on the floor, and next to the fresh dose of the coated news, there was an empty layer of beer.
A couple of cyclists said that he thinks about Extra Place a few times, but he suggested that he could have some kind of promotion.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the activity of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and resistant."
Bilingualism debate: English-language humiliation
In this issue, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and head of the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why the Secondary Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively addressing Spanish voters is a controversial matter.
The Barack Obama educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign suggests that "afro-American and Spanish students have a significantly lower probability that they qualify for white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama advocates the educational agenda especially for those who are only learning English.
The question of Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on the use of languages other than English in the class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take the example of Sixth Street Prep, the charter primary school in the Los Angeles East period.
The students of this school are in the absolute majority of Hispanic cases from low-copy families.
More than a third of the students, from whom many have arrived just recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the 2008 state mathematical tests, 100 percent of students in the fourth grade were at the highest level.
Almost as amazing as ninety-three percent of fourth-class students have reached the highest level in English-language and literature tests in the state.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should take note of this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only learning English "full humiliation".
The lowering of English accentuates the almost primary use of English when teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had great success with one completely new school in Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as a Sixth Street Prep model to look like other schools with large Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-term advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education undermines Obama's prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, it was recently trivialized when he said that people should stop worrying about "English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to eliminate performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational backgrounds that work rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Rope drops due to renewed economic concerns
The prices of oil on Monday fell because of the fears that no US plan to save financial markets would have to revive the economy.
The prices of oil-determined shops fell by 7 per cent in the morning of the New York Comedy Stock Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the last two weeks, markets with commodities have been disrupted by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by a double of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 this month for barrels, which again jumped to the huge uncertainty of financial markets.
The crisis again struck the investors on Monday, and after the Congress Presidency announced that the weekend had reached agreements on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was prompted by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the proceeding, the government announced that the Citigroup will buy the Banking Section of the Wachovia Corporation.
Between the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly replaced the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts of Barclays Capital said that a lively weekend event that led to a plan to save the economy "are shown as unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for comets, including oil, will decline.
"The market surveillance with global shares, interest rates and monetary exchange rates have been seriously destroyed," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in an investor report.
"We assume that the comets will not be able to avoid injuries.
From a comet perspective, our greatest old age is to what extent the American virus is spreading to the whole world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank limited their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption decreased due to slow economic growth and reduced their gas prices by about 20 % in 2009.
Wild ride in the second quarter won the team record
After he spent the last eight seasons in the dress of Jets more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets changed the free game in the Spanish drive.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had leveled their suffering game with violent darkness over themselves.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranueuse Colese to a 12-year-old touchdown sprint, which perfectly marked the afternoon in which their progressive co-operation moved about a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind two other touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his recordings to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
It's been a great communication, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were in trouble, the defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the wrong tail and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped out another tape and caught her.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens won, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's 20-yard goal out of the field, which he got led 34-0.
That's the most time Jets got in one quarter.
The Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reply - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A drop of many points in a short time."
Retired Gebraselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebraselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best distant runner even when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he crossed his own world record and became the first man who ran 26.2 miles of race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 changed 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebraselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has overcome the world record or is at least the world's master at all distances from metric mile to marathon.
Last month, Gebraselassie left the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a back look perhaps too scared - that the polluted air would solve his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the beginning, 55 degrees at the target - won on Sunday Gebraselassie with a blizzard average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the track runners like Gebraselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, dropped the marathon record in the past decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselas told reporters that he had a two-week walk in the air and left a week of training.
It's obvious that he's got a break instead of holding it up.
"I'm so happy," Gebraselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African rival Ethiopia - for planning his races over and over again, usually avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce the enormous running quality of Gebraselassie.
Held in time by four Kenyans reached Gebraselassie half of the time 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite racers James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About something earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebraselassie last took and ran to Kwambai, who then reached second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum in about five minutes.
Kamathi finished the third at 2:07:48.
In the race women finished the excellent year at the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit√≠nkov√°, a relative of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from the United Kingdom.
16 years of Mikit√≠nk's surprise won last year in the spring in London's marathon at 2:24:14.
Beijing's games left for something that was described as a back injury, but she got up and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that she was running, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race ran smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan races escape into a large slope and then reached about 18 1‚ÅÑ2 miles [18 1‚ÅÑ2 km].
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was the second to 2:21:31 and Helen Cyprus from Kenya ended the third at 2:25:01.
Hredness and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the famous Orlando entertainment parks, several miles from all the bright, loud and round, lies a quiet city in which the pride and zeal of African American life is alive.
Eatonville, the first completely black town, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquetes, three sets of nests, three sets of good swimmers, supply of quays, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a resort.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora festival to make a gift to Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she stopped it for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project since the economic crisis.
He's still as independent, decent and private as he was in the thirties when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and didn't share their true feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what's coming."
Even today, in a year when the Montenegrin presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, many of the citizens here remain vigilant in view of foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest farce in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as the paradox triumph and the nama.
It is both a historical model of Montenegro's rise, and a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty is twice the level of poverty against the international average.
It is a medium-sized literature, but also a dab of shadowed example of South American rural black culture - sometimes reversed, sometimes excited - that arose from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's idea really started when Zorou started, which is the only way to be called Hurston's.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her heart-filled book "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes True Watching God (their eyes were watching God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city to road No. 17, which leads through the often missed centre of Florida, in the midst of black history and human drama.
With a large drum in her life and in her literature, Hurston‚Äôs reader led Joe Clark‚Äôs first Eatonville old man to trade, and then turned to more personal places.
"The left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white nest acquired by modern national school with well-maintained halls and playgrounds, which Howard Miller is always old enough to read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and everything that suits the hour hotel."
So only a few hundred words connected Hurston Eatonville with self-government, but also with ingratitude, revitalization of babies and sex.
This obviously wasn't the typical Fodor's loading shop.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 19-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang wild songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurston, she still remembers herself as a chipper, who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventeen-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived without a report in the huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in the city, which today is proud to dress.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Franklin, but a lot of them were angry.
"The people of Zoru always liked to see," said Franklin.
But, he added, he walks on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut out of the press.
It seemed that Eatonville and the rest of the world forgot about her.
Although she was once a literary star, the contemporary Langstone Hughes and the only black man at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida Fort Pierce, where she used to live.
In Eatonville, there were no more sadistic rituals or big public readings.
"I don't think they understood her significance for the world, nor her reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's "Wrapped and Rainbows" (Packed in the Spirits) published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to expand the city of the five-storey district instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-storey main road.
Orlanda's deployment has already pushed the Interstate Road No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ‚Äô s, he waged a struggle to stir up racial hatred to the depths of the community.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff on the people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They walked out of the melon's car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the Supreme Court for forced integration and his decision in Brown's case against the Chamber of Education stated that "for my race it is more offensive than glamorous."
The residents now claim that the degregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced coherence in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil law has helped to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have raised themselves above prejudices with lexical self-esteem and quotes such as "How can anyone resist the pleasure of my presence!
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at the unmarked Hurston grave and began fighting for her reputation.
Five years later, an inspired Hurston magazine from Robert E. Hemanwaye, who reorganized her into the American cannon, came to the police in books.
The distance project arrived just at the time when the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the light ramp again.
The former neighbor of Hurston now considered her a savior.
In 1988, the community started planning the Hurston Festival to show what could happen to destroy its distance.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every ice cream returns to the celebration.
After a few years, the State has stopped from making a proposal.
"These five flows of the distance have risen, you'd say it's fired directly, truly civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it simpler, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the remote project has helped change the image of the city.
In addition, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the present church in 1993, they began to appear in a larger number, and the inhabitants began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (of course after Hurston) was reopened in 2006 to Kennedy Boulevard, a refurbished and demolished.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlanda can sometimes act as a western street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
With other people who come looking for the story and the significance of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most of the talks is necessary to have some things ahead and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that painted whites and which show blacks on the fields - are not allowed to photograph.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a bold, self-evident teacher who likes to have a network of reds, are still worried that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival increased, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he sings a sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police, who says she's going to have some help.
And even younger, such as the eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, as it seems, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they go through here, will think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York, we're all talking cash.
At first sight, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from news stations and distorted TV images on Times Square, they would not be aware that they are standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never have decided that in the dark end, offices over their heads have every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolies New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Consignors keep counting metal vehicles by the sidewalks and transport muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and carrying, like human mulls, fifty of the prized baskets that hang from the wagon on their backs.
Office crossings are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at street dining stations, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi between the fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't look like a crisis at all, until, with all the words about pessimism, I decided to set up an afternoon burning account on Thursday.
Even though I had time for this task so that he could hide with a late afternoon show on my local side of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting on the front.
Not in front of the treasure windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of the check books for older customers, tourists ask for a way to trade with Macy's mixed goods and new customers book their accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starra, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as me.
On the contrary, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called triffs (a little similar to construction spongiform) and money companies and from those types of spongiform, which operate only in one state and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past 15 years, such banks have been in a state of calm.
A few days ago Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went to the contest, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch the rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops, who stood before me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank, which is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
In the last week, the ordinary New Yorkers were taught gas finance.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the healing bank, and her brilliant top executive, Dick Fuld, with such a family background as if she was looking at a line colleague.
And Lynn, a uniformed nearly 50-year-old home of my factory, changed the subject of our regular conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food supplies.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in the money market.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
The Muslim tombs ravaged by the Austrian right-wing crime
Heinz-Christian Feare, on the left, from the Austrian side of the Freedoms and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian side of the right Vlaams Belang took part in the event that she presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the organization "Citys Against Islamization".
They are similar to the transport marks that display the mixtures crossed by the red thread.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of exorcising the Muslim cemetery in Austria for the same weekend, in which the right-wing parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun, near Linze, were once between Friday evenings and this morning it was hard to destroy and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The Vienneses have insisted on some burials of Jewish symbols such as David‚Äôs star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by haters to Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident has been associated with elections.
Speaking here, the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" with news of the obscurity that is coming at the time of the end of the Muslim post month Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria enters the search for its own soul after the transport in yesterday's parliamentary elections has collapsed.
Both parties, which had received more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free Party and the Swaz for the future of Austria, had carried out a very anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were criticised as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Feare, the president of the Freedom Party, who won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against the fights and bursas, and even expressed his resistance to the food in which the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voter in Vienna, he spoke of the "European Brotherhood", which should prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to prevent the construction of mixed and minerals and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections that set out the extreme right to the position of the strongest political bloc in the country indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, ordered the court to proceed to France and Spain.
The officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel across France to Spain.
This ban on the expulsion of the Kent police was rejected last Thursday after she gave the officials evidence of the Glitter's previous judgments on sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, on his own behalf Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Court of the lowest criminal in Kent, but was represented by lawmakers from Cork Binning.
The Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kenyan police requested a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, how he kept a record of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
The planned date of departure of the police must also be transmitted a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the authorities had been mentioned, he could be liable for five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the period.
The Kent police spoke: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that manage the potential danger more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is the highest priority for the Kenyan police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers to reduce any danger to the public at least."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls at the age of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he was to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the passport check and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative David Corker went to the Uxbridge lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time successfully requested Scotland Yard to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned for child pornography for four months in the United Kingdom.
The source of the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior ministry, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, I photograph the master outside the scene." G√ºnther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, rejected from the focus on interpretation - I only aim at the relaxed expression of men or women.
On one side, an artist.
Second, man.
Unsolved, if we remember private, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a reliable gesture, a deep, long look caught, or a passionate gestigulation with your hand, which are unannounced, because they are not going to appear on stage.
German G√ºnther Bauer works in "Flamenco-people" theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less-known face of the masters.
To this end, the photographer draws up a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which is taking place within the Month photography flamenca (Mes de la Fotograf√≠a Flamenca), "represents the growing international importance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that they are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists able to carry on the scene the passion, sorrow, joy... and totally capture the sights.
To capture the personality of these artists, there is no need to photograph the scene.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamingos.
The "Cante de las Minas" festival opened Bauer in 1997 a long way to portray flamenc singers, guitarists and dancers on a disc camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, remind you of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it the current spirit, which is the idea that Bauer himself exposes and flamenco: "The movement with very traditional roots, but it does not cease to surprise and develop."
What the spectators care about is not the performance of the dance, singing, or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days in the El Fotomat gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographers creates famous flamenca figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosov√°, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenca anthology and soon a daughter's book edition will contain exposed portraits.
The passion for portraiting led Bauer to the idea to repeat the idea of "Portrets of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTProject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "to photograph people, recognize them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - it's my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person meets or interacts with people, personalities that he or she does not know at all, or gives him only a few minutes to shoot.
Despite a similar situation, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the current flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Galerie El Fot√≥mata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedo de H√©rcules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes is "trouble"
He is playing in an environment that he does not yet know, and reports about events for him unknown, although Mario Vargas Llosa plans to successfully carry out his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for 20 years in Congo and was also traveling to Amazonia.
The eternal favorite Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival admitted that the project that employs him is "a waste of time", and that "everything suggests that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had a sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it once," said his contribution to the Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Words, which he saw in the city for four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the theater Juan Bravo in the last place.
With F√©lix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience before him, who had spent an hour of time running like water - Peruc with great precision and a useful dose of humor, remembered in him how from the original "incredulous adventure" of "the pleasure of his readers" and from "the power to live more than I lived" gave birth to literary messages; how he subjected "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", he carefully arranged the text, corrects and rewrites; or how his writing was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "remind images" were the basis of his stories.
The Hispano American novelist admitted that "there is no way" as to whether and to what extent the books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a little experience" - stressed Vargas Llos by "acting on people" and "the need to try to excuse themselves from a series", and urged writers to "abstain from the free will" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climatology loses fame in Pozoblanc - missing copies
The performance with copies that close the celebration in Pozoblanca was cancelled yesterday morning after confirmation of the notification of the effect that the surface of the site is not in good condition.
So the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern√°ndez, decided to end the race.
The unfavourable weather conditions of this celebration are long-lasting, and two of the three celebrations could not have been fulfilled.
On Saturday, the rains of the other scheduled bullfights were made possible.
During the formation of Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠az and Juan Bautista, she was to build the bivalves in the arena on Castilblanca.
But that's how it was only Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who set up three ears and rewarded the dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two wounds with cups for greetings and one ear that brought him more hidden seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse, El Juli, who passed through the bull's arena of Los Llanos, was incalculable.
In the second round of the drain, without a single breath, he earned a sharp criticism from most of the obsessives.
They took control of √Ölava in a delivery with two thousand kilograms of hash
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the town district Armin√©√≥n (Alava).
The officers stop two people driving in the van and you drive them away.
The cost, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the Committee's report, the members of the Committee within the Basque Government followed them and held one of the drivers in the supplier, a man 38 years old, who was identified as A.A. J.
The detainee was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on N-1 in places where the border of the city district of Armin√≥n is crossing.
They were going to stop the delivery for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, rushed fast and caught.
The car owners began to fight right away when the vehicle stopped at the end of a few miles away, both passengers jumped out at that time and fled to the forest.
Ertzaintzy‚Äôs followers finally captured one of them and had fun of 2 178 kg of hash, which they suspected of overcoming the appearance of Iveco Daily‚Äôs brand.
The last part of the vehicle was loaded with a hash bag, which was subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the badge was "scattered" and did not agree with the data contained in the supply documents, so they were also accused of falsifying the state documents.
Ertsaintza continues in pursuit of a second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the drug.
Arrested A. A. J., 28 years old, he was transferred to the police department to arrange the appropriate formalities before he later joined another investigation.
Hereƒçka Heather Locklear is detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Hereƒçka Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, reported the magazine People speaking California Road Guard.
The witness made it clear that around 16.30 a.m., Locklear's "prunkled on gas, drove in front and back for loud noise and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times when she was being beaten by the sunglasses".
A witness who didn't know her first thing, saw Locklear a moment after she stopped at a distance and came out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service, because "she was afraid of the life of Locklear."
When a police guard arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She looked disoriented," and therefore the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo the test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, although "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medications, which served as a first-looking guard."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the effects of the next unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19:00, although it was released for several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares requires the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in Silva causa
The chief general of the IU and the member of the Joint Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Committee on Youth and Sport at Seville Francisc Manuel Silvy, who retired from the office last week after being accused of dealing in favour of his family, will depend on the country's association.
"I am a very federalist, it is on the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out the deal, to which the party will have to step up in relation to the former member of the Civil City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal conduct allowed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU always fought for similar matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Sangre de mayo" (Sangre de mayo), Epic bet of Garcia
Jos√© Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de Mayo", to which he was inspired by the National History of Benita P√©rez Gald√≥se, revives the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French - one of the most ambitious films in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "explain the state and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paul Echevarr√≠a during the presentation of the image before a large team of interpreters.
The flower blood with metrage over two and a half hours will be placed in the cinema this Friday and in the future more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid will be held.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Gald√≥se Jos√© Luis Garci, he claimed to have fulfilled his "child's dream" by filming this film, for which thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who had entrusted him three years ago to the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming the second year of Madrid on 2 May, he accepted the offer by coming from the National History Episode.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has contributed, means for Garci's "one opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "a shaking Spain that was wrong in the leadership for which it was going to fight - fighting for independence led to the fall of the governments of Ferdinand VII and the rest of the country," he said.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count on the financial support he received from the films The sad wing (Ala sade) or Goy's ghosts - almost double the flower blood -, so he could not capture some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valƒçarcel, with which he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as he is usually used to - on the scene with the actor who usually tries before the film and who does not choose to cast, because it seems to him to be "degrading" and also believes that "part of the director's call is beyond going to the theater and cinema and so to find out what's going on in the novel he's doing."
Many of the actors he chose for the Blood of May are already appearing in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larran√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations on Oscar, from which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Flower Blood itself, the seven tables of the French billaire and the last selected blind sunglasses, presents a young generation of Spanish film scene, but claims that "it will only appear".
Garci doesn't expect any credit for this movie.
"At first, you think you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize that you're working only for the benefit, and then you're going to make another movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bay√≥n revives the spiritual link of Sevilla dancer Tortoly Valencia
Sevilla dancer flamenca gives hold to other Sevilla dancers.
Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia, father of Florence T√≥rtola Ferrer and mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, she moved with her family to London.
She danced a modern dance and focused on an oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, she was a progressive woman emancipation such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and was fighting for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life influenced the dance and aesthetic revolution of the inter-war Europe Isabele Bay√≥n.
"I wanted to work with Pepou Gamboa and she proposed this position to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about taking her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythms.
So my "movie dance" was evocating a guajira or "gade dance" some kind of tanga.
Her dance was smart and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also in line," they say.
The performance is composed of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Povedo, who will sing Isabele in one performance as in the "Open Doors" (La porta aperta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined in collaboration with her former jacket.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature character.
I'm glad she accepted the offer to take part in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the song of Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Mor√≥n; drums El P√°jara, the violin of Rafa El Violy and the co-operation of the actor Juanfry Ju√°rez, "which has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primed with everyone, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who has played for her own time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who at some time had a huge influence, but nobody knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," Bay√≥n says.
The show starts today at 8:30 in Lope de Vegy.
The book "Friendly Married" also closes trienals
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "Denique fresco" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez closed his date with Zenobi in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian Government at the celebration of "Trenale Zenobie and Juan Ram√≥n" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Year of Their Death.
"Triumnals Zenobie and Juan Ram√≥n" aims at the end of the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramon Jim√©nez: On a sunset", which was opened in May of this year, and after lunching a different Andalusian province, according to plans at the time of the congress, it should be moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian Government also ordered eight sets of prints "Denique of freshly married" by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob P√©rez-Encis to continue spreading the awareness of the personality and part of one of the world's world's most famous writers.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the artist Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without a bad idea" and knowing that Newman had left, revealing his unwelcome vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been in retirement since 2007.
And that he knew he was very ill.
And yet he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and I've lost a big friend now," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be funny or out of the way.
The father of the film and the authorities died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when the American self-conscious is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When time is harsh and people without dignity and only a handful of those who stand for you - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official supporter of Richard Nixon and the warrior for the saved and saved cases, from the supply of drug addiction based on honor of the first-born son who died of overdose, until after his own mark of domestic food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has continued to make a lot of efforts to forgive itself from a self-killing diet.
The stormy wave of storms has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, the holder of the Sam Mendes regime, said working with Newman was without a top point in his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, troufl Newman mark himself as his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has all of us planted a very high spring," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live as a living Paul Newman - is based on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But fortunately, there are people like that and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married to Joanne Woodward, who has been faithful, even though the teacher had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out to a hamburger when I have a file at home?" he would like to joke.
Let him be proud in the sky that he will rule the earth to unite his daughters and admirers - it is not too common in America.
It is said that "for all the great roles that he had acquired, he was the most proud of the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrifice philanthropist".
Unperfect races in the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the unfavorable year 2012 it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we run the race yesterday, I'll say no!
It was about him as a perfect race, and according to my trial, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of nonsense that, as soon as it came to an evaluation and I was testing, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, just one at a time.
Insects begin by picking up a race number for which a person must speak first.
I don't think that's bad, but when a man goes there, they give him everything (including the chip that's supposed to be overloading the road).
Oh, no.
Here a man had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after a related front) - what a surprise! - they only had a trick size S (second nonsense because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little trick because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
Okay, well, that's a small thing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Except that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front of it lasted over 15 minutes, it had to give up the bat.
It lasted 35 minutes waiting time, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected to have something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't put down our boots yet, and when it happened, it was much worse to pick up.
The wait also lasted 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general explosion and a cabin attack.
I believe that 500 of us will have to shut down tomorrow and some of us, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results for the chip that they gave me and which, as I suppose, did not record the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't think of this.
And so I think we're gonna have to just let the well-prepared Olympic city look.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would be moving around the entire area of society) and doing what he heard in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can determine how many people are in the room who - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort the currents according to the conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the reception records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going after someone, and she's telling her she's going to be committed in a moment.
That's all without the blue picture of death.
Fascinating.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things at work, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial remains, they would be five times the most efficient - man, Steve, but they'll be cheaper.
Discover as a thunder when we consider that Microsoft version adds a new function to Windows and another "extra".
A change of direction would be an act of merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system loses little importance and is also software on it.
When Google Chrome appeared online, I became one of those who applied to the theory that it was Google's first step to competition with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary level for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the fabric.
That's right.
It never disappears, but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and, on the other hand, to more Internet browsers.
The computer is turned off to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What are half of the applications that run the system?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Zoufale needs it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the machine that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week with the exception confirmed the delay of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, then let's count to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming more computer.
Given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay for the delay.
Le Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azuro coast, Leonardo di Capri in one shot in "The Blood Diamond" Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmothrov" France Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniformed gay community.
And if we want to let ourselves be counted on his role of life, we can bow down to the image of a typical sledgehammer with a sharp doll that lifts the act in a coarse circle.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton-dolled pantyhose, protracted and unhandled.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleus Marcel from Brussels comes out above all others.
For the first time in his name, even when people call him 'Marcel', which is related to sport, because, according to the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' comes from the other quality cotton, unisex cutting, distinguishing with the label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which have models of non-immblematic tiles as a detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specializing only on tank tops.
It also manufactures college furniture, retro boxers, cashmere hats, cotton pants, seam shirts, clothes for children, mini shirts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just a underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
An enormous image did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, as a small figure, is a woman full of life.
The sister of Cruz's sister is now taking her new fashion action very seriously.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just that some beautiful, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, the promotion action that Mango has organised in its new headquarters was attended, as well as the declaration of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and she's getting close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that Sister Pen√©lope proposed for Mango this afternoon-summer season, and I also participated in the second year's Mango Fashion Awards and dinner in Opera for Valentine's Day.
So it was a challenging but exciting day at the same time.
What's your new collection for Mango that you've been working for since the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the age of 50 and 60, and we've had a lot of excitement.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and tear their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but at the end of the day everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I had to take off my clothes, and I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closets, and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a trip.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
But you know that we dancers are relying on how we're adjusted to feel good in our hours and tests when looking into the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you're really going to get into the stable.
So everything is connected, of course, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've had 30 recently, you've been hit by a crisis?
I don't know.
I'm feeling better than ever, I'm having a good time.
I find the woman is already ready, she has experience, and she enjoys less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I do what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as father is concerned, I don't care.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will bring him up with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, you've been waiting for a couple of movie premieres you filmed last year.
It's like that, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I'm coming out of the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and of course it's not going to work.
I look forward to the premiere "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
The way you're gonna like it...
A few days ago, you had your prime minister at the screening mill on the side of Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'd go to the mill like a model.
She only called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in a beneficial review for her "Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes we had led - I selected two models from our collection for Mango - and the burden was passed on to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things, and I, since I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to lead for charity, but when she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
I'll do what I need to do for the women of the third world.
Drivers repeatedly arriving with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcollock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions under the influence of alcohol must install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting a car in the womb or if he does not rest.
The proposal has come to know already in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
His goal is to return the drivers to the wheel, so the drivers will also have to complete the train ride.
This experience will also be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to the statistics, between 30 and 75 % of motorists charged more than once for the treatment in the stock market will again be used as a wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the air and prevents the driver from starting the car if the driver is previously inactive or if it is marked higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price is over 1,000 euros and he'd have to pay it himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that in vehicles equipped with this equipment, the infringement was reduced by 65 % during the first year of introduction.
In Spain it is estimated that every year it could save 115 people.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is committed in a criminal act.
And in order to help introduce it, because legal correction can be carried out in a normal way, the necessary correction of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Just tomorrow the Congress will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 a.m., as was the case in the programme, a Spanish air force plane arrived in the Presidential Hangar at Benit Ju√°rez Airport in Mexico D. F., where the prince and princess of Asturia arrived.
The sun had just come down, but his paprika still had to close their eyes to see the next couple coming out of the plane.
He became a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince with the princess was coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, so that's great, it's not gonna get people to pick up at the airport... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right.
The Mexican press, however, well knows who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right at the red deck and the military cordon, which consists of 27 sea soldiers prepared to shoot an honest rescue.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue dress and a princess, very neatly dressed and with discolored hair, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. he is a dangerous storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and order them without charge.
One of the four largest hotels in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best available fashion price
There's probably no better place in the world to declare fashion prices than Paris and there's probably no more famous designer and award-winning than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliov√°, winner of the first year, last night she looked at her proposals in Manga's exhibition at the Paris bubble Haussmann number 54 and almost cried with a hug.
Of course, it is the second largest business of this company in Europe and has just been opened at 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the draftsman Valentina for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, have led us to finally dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's famously decorated Presidential Table appeared next to the most significant Chagall works even more wonderful.
Nati, who was heartbroken for her brother‚Äôs recent death, did not reveal anything, dressed herself in the dress of this badge and Elah‚Äôs jewelry, over which the breath was hidden, and hung in her son Luis - almost two meters of elegance - accompanied Valentina in the chair at dinner for his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and, as a real gentleman, stayed with Baroness Rothschild without a jacket, because they both offered it to two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who came to the store in - ownly designed - pants and shirts and dressed in long black dresses for dinner, took a night walk after the opera following Goyi Toledov, showed us the hall for ballet tests, and at other times, she caught one of the points and marked "grand pl√©√©".
In√©s Sastreov√° didn't stop after the next building, but she showed us her son's pictures on the mobile phone before leaving.
The second morning we were able to love the presence of Oliver Mart√≠nez - another young man who rides a motorbike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and gloves and first asked that no wine be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh there, that's life.
1001 - Anti-trafficking number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and obsessive everyday life.
And in order not to be too short, all of them are included in one book that will bring to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm sounds every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called voltage and the computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there are no one, no two methods to fight daily exhausting and problems to get rid of the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her books, gathered all the "menu" options, adjusted according to taste and time options of each individual.
The book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, "handbook" rejects this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with natural or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't have adrenaline in your veins, which re-balances in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Sleeping Speech
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and the kids tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens first, it may cure you, but in fact it's insignificant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called sleepiness.
It's very common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, one of you was told that he was talking about sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadic (e.g. once a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child remembers nothing.
There's not only one reason to explain her performance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night rage, night enuresis (night care) or migraine, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or anxiety.
In any case, it's a bit of a puzzling eve.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say the individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where he is shown with great strength, it would be appropriate for a child to observe and consult with an expert to determine whether there is any problem that causes him great hardship and thus manifests itself.
We said it was a non-injurious disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is eaten with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for the quiet games and avoid some scary or some violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who are given the job to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to gain some inner peace.
The child will be able to sleep more quietly.
When sleepwalks appear, try to keep calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child and she won't remember anything from what she did on the second day.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him.
It's unnecessary because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember, if you feel that you are suffering a lot more than once, it would be wise to seek advice or find out what causes such distress in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to listen to him and draw information from him.
It won't do anything, because when he sleeps, he's not aware that he can arrange his thoughts.
Besides, you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and then why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
It's causing a lot of trouble.
Don't worry about it, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of silence.
Without a major match, the glaucoma created more opportunities and managed to change one of them successfully.
The game didn't have a lot of speed during this shooting, in which the attackers were very hard to carry out.
After the first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, who was shot from a distance just about the hair of the previous compound, began to have Illhaeusern light drafts and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to the defense of Dannemaria.
The opponent, on the other hand, set up a defensive wave in the middle of the game and left only Agilian Riahhi at the stake.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, and first thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria named Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, whom Marais took care of, well located for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeuserna was not happy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to go back to the closet and leave his associates so weak.
However, Dannemaria was unable to endure and eleven of Illhaeusern, who had just gotten a little bit to "stop" the defense, no longer caused any major difficulties, with the exception of the very last seconds of the match, when the ball had flown very close to the edge after a great confusion.
Sarkozy is going to blow up the scattered fishermen
Before leaving the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Britain.
To face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who broke the access of several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the Guilvinec port in Finist√®re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last nominations promised to accept "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "will come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the "crisis committee's meeting" of the Breton fishermen to take action against the rapid increase in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Ellysei Palace, President David Martinon "will talk about solutions that can be presented in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with indiscriminateness.
On Tuesday morning, the operation of the "lemojid" (slightly driving vehicles) was carried out in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, which caused a smooth 10km delay.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections towards Belle-√≠le were not interrupted.
A filtration fence was carried out on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination already on Monday, when immediately before the storage of the fuel supplies of ports in Brest and Lorient, the tires and pallets were burning, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc there were demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and to the canal of La Manche, as to Sables d'Olonne in Vend√©e, where they remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of important refineries in Donges during the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act themselves until the mid-term meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide on how to continue on the way forward and on its participation in the prepared meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movements.
"The situation will continue" because "fishers of nothing will leave" and "don't want to go to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, for example, president of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
Fish from a call that does not pay oil tax are currently about 50 cents per litre, however, it judges that the ship's performance threshold is achieved only when it is oil below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman Great
The unforgettable representative "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes gave up the legend of a film and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
Brazil's aircraft manufacturer is on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that is rising above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his delivery requirements for 2008 with 215 devices added, his President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, in particular has its 30 to 120 seats on the top of the scale of its aircraft.
To this day Embraer has added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG takes into account the spread of 15 % of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, whose US monetary authorities have received water, considers that he would spend more than 15% of his assets to pay $85 billion, which he was given as a deposit, writes the Sunday financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and income activities in the United States, clarifying the journal which quotes the sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Governing Council met on Sunday during the evening to examine possible actions.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to redeem include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance provider, as well as its portfolio of properties and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No final decision on these actions has yet been taken, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain cash to pay the 85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve Bank has provided to it, with the risk that the US authorities will spend 80 % of its capital, while also disbursing the current shareholder's shareholding.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the November representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is unknown loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The biggest point in today's history (about 684.81) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component has lost, according to the definitive data after the end of the trade, 199,61 points and has been set at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points.
Since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed after an unexpected rejection of the plan to save the Bank of Snow Representatives, a plan that should allow for a little stability to be found on the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
The homeless two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that the Congress is unable to adopt a plan," says Lindsey Pegza from FTN Financial.
"It shows how much this plan of the market depended on," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed to failure (...), the staff will be immediately handed over to Fed (American Central Bank, late red) and to other central banks in order to welcome the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, the head of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Pegza has argued that in the United States "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution".
After Friday, Washington Mutual organized the Bank's bank's bank's bank's resupply with its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly turned around and has requested prompt intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are not "only in the US crisis, but in the world crisis", an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market went down.
Profits from the 10-year cash statement fell to 3,632 % versus 3,827 % on Friday night, the 30-year profit to 4,161 % versus 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first television show
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, the task being to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leaders of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a television show that followed a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "bralant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, down in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday, contributes to Obama's five-pound jump (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrats are the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters on which it is precisely concerned, Obama is the winner of 39% of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% is the winner of McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-founder Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's lucky," said Bill Clinton about the weekend.
Seventy-one McCain has consistently raised his unmistakable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "nateness" of his opponent on issues that created the core of the first intervention.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican television show was held yesterday.
On the contrary, Obama stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be a careful and precise person.
He expressed his ability to make the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he said about the weekend's democratic meeting, which tells the Republican that it is not enough to take into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina for the rain.
He did not even speak words like "the middle class" or "workers". The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom the Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the disaster.
"The next week, he could give himself a decisive return," estimated the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama with the "economic prosiavost" that Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democrats, the current funeral is "the ultimate verdict of eight-year-old poor economic policy, as George Bush and Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that, through unexpected jumps, Wall Street should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of potential energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is again planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates were careful to avoid questions regarding the financial assistance plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which the Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and supporters of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to deny the results of the parliamentary elections first.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the elections at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections in parliament.
Although no results have been reported so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demisi".
Some admit that they didn't even say to the election, "What would it be like if they did what they wanted to do with my voice," says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been in favour of foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn towards democracy.
Penalties, which include the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections were considered clean.
It wasn't like that, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers should not participate in the counting of votes," said Juri Potƒõmkin, a spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmic change," stresses Alexandr Milinkieviƒç, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of pro-European movement, "because it is essential to calculate the votes, and we have the power to do so.
If some opposition Members get to parliament, it will be by being appointed, and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean a place on television, a meeting in the regions and a proposal for laws."
The opposition is therefore obliged to participate in political functioning, because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Since our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is going to be a crisis and we are not reforming, it threatens us to become Russia's protectorate.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the course of the elections, does not declare elections valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26 % of votes in Minsk) has opened the way with all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections?" asked the social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those most eligible for the regime."
The night's silence again faded from October's square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased to see success.
Discussion - Blood, which is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment and his president, Dr. Francine D√©cary, was quite happy because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 80 ‚Äô s and 90 ‚Äô s.
As is generally known, the state blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated during the 1980s by an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a C-type hepatitis virus.
In view of this drama and the wave of unrest, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994 to which Judge Horace Krever, President of the Commission, intended to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster.
While Judge Krever continued to deliver the report, some provinces set up a committee aimed at planning a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Qu√©bec, the G√©line's committee was set up.
According to the report by G√©lineau and Krever, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Qu√©bec, which was to be owned by Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. D√©cary recalls.
"The situation was overwhelming.
In a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that in early 2008 Hema-Qu√©bec already believed 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. D√©cary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is a very fragile thing."
Hema-Qu√©bec has applied the principle of caution since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
"At that time we witnessed in Europe the existence of many human cases of the disease of crazy cows, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," reports the woman who has been leading the company since her founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, we have supported one of the basic recommendations of Krever and G√©lineau's report, according to which, in the event that we do not know, and when serious disease is at the heart of spreading, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which constitutes the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exceptional measures.
Thus, in April 1999, we refused to accept blood from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was passed on to blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution made sense."
In 1999 there was a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that reveal the presence of a single virus directly in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which tests have been used previously.
NAT tests have been able to shorten the period between the patient's infection and the moment our first sources can be discovered in the blood, the specialist explains.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
Basically, we reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and that we could not get to it.
This improvement made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is one of the 12 million people exposed today.
"In their words, it means that before someone gets infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
In view of this, Hema-Qu√©bec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions that are necessary for healing," says Hema-Quebeka Chief of Management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what a pathogen can be found in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on R√©union Island, which, like the West Nile virus, transmits to blood by biting the tissue.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. D√©cary, stressing that, in addition to safe storage, Hema-Qu√©bec must also count with sufficient resources.
"They need to grow, because the population is getting old.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or blood clots.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecans eligible for donation."
Every healthy person at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can only give blood once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people with blood supply are not accepted on average because they are carrying AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited a country where the bathrobes are regulated, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of patients.
The deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to complement reasonably with how old they are and can no longer give blood.
However, to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep it, and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unscrupulous today that we can only find an hour to give blood," Francine D√©cary says.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Qu√©bec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eye bubbles and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Qu√©bec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the Qu√©bec poppy can.
The papyrus, previously considered as biomedical waste, pours blood rich on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the monkeys to the bank, and we assume that we will take them back over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. D√©cary, who describes the blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Qu√©bec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
The impact of Montreal last night at the stadium of Saputo during the second and at the same time deciding the quarter-final match played on the total number of branches qualified to the semifinal round of the first USL series, thanks to win 3:1 (4:3 is a goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattle.
Lieutenant Antonio Ribeiro gave the final goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided free first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two rounds of visual formation, were inserted.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult Matt Jordan for the benefit of the Sounders.
Remember that on Friday during the first of the two quarter-finals, the impact on Starfire Complex in Tukwile on Seattle defeat 2:1.
The impact will be measured in the semifinals of its power with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled in the home match deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into the semifinal round with a total number of branches 5:4.
However, the impact should be addressed with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, details of the series of matches will be confirmed to date.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three Canadian attacks are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tom√°≈° Plekance and Andreja Kosticina last night at the Centre Bell triggered an attack on the victory of Canada 3:2 on their own rides.
Kosticin, the largest shooting star, shot the goal, the Plekanec assembled two assists and Kovalev held one recording in this fourth triumph of three-coloured games.
Kovalev won the victory by giving himself a single goal during the rides.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Russia.
"I need another match to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to handle it too much," Guy Carbonneau noted.
"But I think he assessed the end of the match.
He had a nice smile."
Charest lies in the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that by the end of the year the elections will be held in advance.
Immediately after the conclusion of the meeting of the Liberal Party (Party Liberal), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"Move between our last large northern border": such is the long-lasting ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual way in the conclusion of the meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in L√©vis, but he did not tell the details.
During his speech, his back was painted in a picture mill.
On the three round plates, a slide with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric fences, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources, like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the other Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding early elections, even though he warned that he had a very busy programme.
"The North Plan" is the fourth dimension of "vision", which the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, a agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although the opening of the North - Northern Territory at the 49th Equivalence - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "great potential curse", but did not provide a time limit, investment rate, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At the very least, he mentioned a number of approaches to the points that could be further developed: in particular water plants, forests, especially the coal sector, driven by rapid growth in developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains "nick, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as much as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, but he's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he's calling for a certain national foundation.
Qu√©bec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: the gold medal in Abidjan, the Qu√©bec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he turned off the theater to look at the huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, clarified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has repeated all the governments of today.
There is a border line that no longer exists, and if an opportunity arises, on behalf of the government, this position will be re-occupied," he pointed out.
Otherwise "it is also necessary to rethink our North vision in relation to climate change," he said when he spoke of the North-West transition, which will open all year round as a result of the ice-cream.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the peoples of origin and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©toureau (formerly Pequistian Member of Hungary), had already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was initiated by the Interministerial Committee, chaired by Beno√Æt Pelletier, where Julie Bouletov√° (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be lifted".
The development of the North should continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visis" as a gas wave on the vision of the liberal prime ministers who were ahead of him.
"Like the liberals who have preceded us, we have changed our thinking to change our challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was still one of the still exaggerated topics of the weekend, which was launched by a large cocktail that raised the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage to the front of the party on Friday.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois Centre at the Ad√©lard-Godbout overhaul.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who carried out the Clyde Revolution and nationwide water power, until after Burass, who created James' Bay, proved our party to create a future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he turned to another authority, this time conservative, and even on the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, the premiere from 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper pipeline, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm planning to be on it," he said to his members' base, and he called out a great surprise.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that in 2008, there would be no elections, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the autumn of this year, which makes it possible for him to do so.
He stressed, however, that his program was adjourned, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Qu√©bec-New York Summit.
The weekly meeting provided the leader of the liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "powers to change the constitution", which passed very cold: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) requires in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It is also desirable that Quebec appoint a member of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council who should have the right to veto in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted by skeptics in its main lines.
Chief PQ (Parti Qu√©becis) Pauline Marois again drew out the Qu√©bec Northern Development Policy, which the Landry government left in 2001.
According to it, when the Liberals' government gained power in 2003, the implementation of this policy was refused.
If she could hold on to it, "we'd be going on today," Marois said on the side of his Jean-Tallon candidate (where elections are taking place today) Fran√ßoise Mercure.
ADQ said he would support the North Plan's adoption in the government.
"We accept, however, that it is not just a theater," explained S√©bastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disadvantaged countries
He was Vic Toews, former minister of justice in Harper's office, who in the summer of last year allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour, that he was a "hanbu" for Canada.
This is how to silence a woman who has led an insurmountable fight for justice and who deserves all our attention, it tells a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us, which, as the only one in all the Western countries involved, has not returned to the authority of its state-owned member of the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even realize that at the time when the acts he was being executed were to be played, Omar Khadr was a teenager.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Women's Convention, is closing up its words and letting the child's child soldier in non-uid conditions.
The only one who depends on the parody of justice to judge the guilty.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers defend the repatriation of Omara Khadra so that there can be a fair trial in Canada.
The government closes its eyes before torture: it doesn't care that this young man is first psychologically destroyed, and it no doubt lasted, after so many years of oppression.
We don't realize that, but we're just witnesses of the smooth erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", the words that Harper has so much affection and which from his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morals: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to put him in custody according to the libel of the chief until the minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation on the side that speaks of the Trinity, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has denied what has created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this rejection, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, CEO of the Canadian Labour Company Barrick Gold.
Orwell's logic confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the three authors and the poor small charge facility for insulting honours with the aim of calling for a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an insult to honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver has this fundamental distinction completely removed.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring anyone who dares to take the opposite position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend a decent amount to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost useless pockets of the company.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights are often used to destroy the accused in order to bring about a peaceful procedure that will shut the mouth of the opposite side and also scare anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have taken a look at the whole thing as a public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in a number of countries where Barrick Gold is active, in Canada, there is a debate on normal circumstances in exchange of ideas, and not in the mornings.
Therefore, it was not enough for the company to open its books, its documentation and conduct a real debate through news, the media, the publication and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and shamelessly rejects the petition and letters to support Noir Canada's book authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" and at the same time reject opinions from the public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it's quite a narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak, too, to the intruders.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects brutal ways of working.
The public is prepared to listen and judge the matter, but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many consider to be a complaint, in which the accused must be sued (in the context of their complaint, the "public debate" of Barrick, by way of exception, has just called on Noir Canada's authors to officially inform them that they should stop using this term...).
If we remember the surreal Garver speech, the struggle initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the universal freedom of inquiry and the search for truth that is essential for every democratic society.
The right to quote confidential sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual activity, is generally denied.
If in a country, like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, without us exposing ourselves to repeated harassment, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it were guided by the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts from now on.
Barrick Gold‚Äôs well-known complaint clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is lost, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such an unauthorized landing.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and envoys to Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the biggest saved economic plan since the crisis of the thirty years.
A new version of the plan, using 700 billion US dollars to alleviate the financial crisis, which has been covered by Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control of the elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of public money, new measures to capture the number of non-payment houses and also the right to monitor the amount of employees paid by the company's managers.
US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Snow House of Representatives Nancy Pelosiov√° and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis just going on on Wall Street," the Democrats explained.
"This is a key point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and the destruction of the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiation has gone on to the maximum recovery of fear of the effect, which would be further failures in investor deployment.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates to the President of the United States were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but they did not recall expressing their discontent with the need to avoid such a final solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed a follow-up to the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable the owners of the dwelling and the measures to be taken on behalf of the employers.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the non-responsibility of some people, there is no reason to be glad about it.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked to vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough rhymes that I have read are that it is about something that we all have to spend and through which it will be possible to move on.
Choosing inactivity is a short-term unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion plan is to redeem the funds of the debtors of questionable claims and the risk and non-marketable assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis by breaking the bubble into the property market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another broader form of loans (PCAA) and ended in the freezing of cash and in the disbursement of banks and financial institutions.
The breach of the first proposal for a last week's agreement has been brought to the attention of the Republican Members.
Since the democratics have come to the conclusion that, for some "toxic" assets of companies with problems, the government will only handle them, but will not redeem them, it is the belief that the non-profit situation is blessed.
In an effort to bring forward anti-social opinions in Congress, measures have been introduced to ensure that the government will be able to introduce new fees that would help it to recover its deposit if the programme will have to recover losses for a period of five years.
The new plan shall be calculated by depositing the first amount of 250 billion, to which the additional 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in saved companies that in case of profit will pay him dividends and that will be able to sell again when it's all over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the entertainment of the properties linked to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The officials of the plan would like to vote in the shadow of the representatives already today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
The vote against this project continued yesterday, both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
"It is obvious that Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Commission of Snowford.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not a solution for the taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, a moderator of the group of congressmen named "the selection of skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"There are four respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize holders, we have written: we ask Congress not to be too quick and carefully examined which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it is derogating from the purchase of its competitors, which has been in the process of decommissioning since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) due to a crisis of risk loans to purchase properties in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We are not coming to this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it's just the supervisors and the households at this time of day that can be evaluated."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems that the British government has launched another bank in the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$ 75.5 billion) had made loans to purchase properties.
According to his yesterday's announcement, the Spanish bank of Santander will buy the sidelines and the account of the customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to renationalize from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azur eyes long represented his tummy, according to other weaknesses.
Was this American actor with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
Humility, sensitivity, and insidious talents, which were his own, also distanced him from the strong category that produces real stars.
What a long journey it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years of age at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years American cinematography.
Less grander than Brando, who had been like him for a long time as his rival on the film board, Newman was a more careful actor, indeed a Christian, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian origin.
One of these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, which is the last mark of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with itself made mana, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who studied at Yale in the early 50s, then visited New York's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theater, television and dances in the film.
The man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer, who was placed second at a 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he had created a model couple with an actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, there are also decent places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the travel of their own show-business, which will always remain to a certain extent mysterious.
You're a good man, in the strongest word of meaning.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend caused the film's lovers to give up, while his big role together competes on a black salary memory.
After him, he is defiling more than half a century of constantly changing American art.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a heated roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient times (1990), we have his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who has been disturbed by a marriage that has failed to fulfill all expectations.
There's so many other Newman Pauls in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a hardened, violent, memorable delicator from Someonebody Up There Likes Me (In Sign of Hatred) Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, takes over after his death, which Newman introduced in real knowledge in 1956.
A very nice gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A warm and enchanting collector in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure will be created in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face of traveling ages, it was him.
It's him again.
In his career, he's going through different ages together.
Young people know her primarily because of the cult-like Slap Shot George Roye Hill (1977) of the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met with him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He then completed his career as an Irish Mafia's sister in the Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends, which were quite soon left behind, Newman remained in the long industry, perhaps judging Hollywood with his talents, performances and performances.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without a sense of humor, considered her "for the living challenge underplaying", as a judge, that in his performances he pushed too much on the ball.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the role came as a forebear, the profession was not always so tender.
The first lovers, however, played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, wolves and vengefuls, whose fall and rebellion reflected in his perfect cheeks.
As director, Newman discovered a few known pages of his shyness.
His 1968 film, Rachel (according to Roman Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, gave a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who was lost due to his overdose, he dedicated a film to Harry and Son in 1984, full of shame and sorrow.
In the line of action that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former partner Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) proudly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Charity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we remember his legendary career, there's also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposition to the fall of Hollywood.
Like him, we were used to seeing on bottles of wine vinegar, butter, dried foods and other foods, which could seem quite untasteful, even though it was a gag at first.
However, profit from the sale went to the account of his Nadia for a difficult childhood.
Newman did, rather than let himself be caught up in fame, he's been engaged in company for the last time.
With his five daughters, he left a letter containing these words: "Your father was always grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor for me to be here."
And it was an honor for us to observe the life course of such a clear and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the day, a model citizen.
What was made in the factory on the invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
In the meantime, on 8 October, the trial begins in criminal proceedings against J√°nosi Zuschlaga and his associates.
Politicians and their partners are, in addition to other criminal acts, including the burning of the leaves, accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematic criminal organisations, which have resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and carried out their tasks often with fictional invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - including about 65 million forints - traveled part to the treasure organization Fiatal Balldal, part to the capes of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed the investigating authority was based on the fact that the money received in the public competitions was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-value and that the company's commitments were never met.
According to the complaint, much of the invoice was false.
The prints to these invoices came from the jessefvaros market, the bulleted seal was produced in Kisunhalas.
On behalf of which company the production of the invoice was to take place, it was decided, inter alia, on the border road to the northern coast of Balathon, on which Istv√°n Ladose J√°nos Zuschlag sent it.
According to his statement, his first appointment was to look at pensions and restaurants.
They asked for accounts for their consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the course of public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, were produced.
The fact is that most of Istv√°n Lados and his partner Andras √ïrim, who, according to our information, wrote the most frequently needed messages to obtain subsidies.
On his "Study Road" Lados looked at one of the basements.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and his associates in 2003, this hosting power plant was provided for a group of 19 members from Biztos Pont.
So many people, however, would not be able to do so at the same time, according to the firm's claim.
Similarly, the invoices presented in the summer of 2002 with the name Job J√∂v Ãà√©rt, later Egy√ºtt and Harmadik √âv√®vred√©rt have been moved with formal and substantive errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomy had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, although the bill had a hundred and thirty guests.
However, the authors of the magazines with a rich imagination ignored this even when they quoted the documents of a company which also related to hospitality - Pigal s. o., in whose accounts according to the information provided to the State representative, documents bearing the name Job J√∂v √©rt and Hoppa did not appear.
The company's leaders, Gy…ôzÀà Farkas for hvg.hu, said that when they called him to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong mark."
As he added, apart from formalizing, there was no agreement that hundreds of people had been accommodated, so there are only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included feeding, with their restaurants not working for a long time.
Horli‚Äôs invoice producers did not even agree that the proposed Budapest travel office was organizing only foreign travel, and on the cash payment invoice, which was also not compatible with the company‚Äôs invoice practice, the passengers were introduced as a travel broker in Hungary.
In addition, as occurred during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On four documents submitted by Jobb J√∂v √©rt, Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, to VAT. However, the company's activity does not include the 25 per cent mentioned but the 15 per cent VAT, in addition to which the hotel's employees only issued printed invoices, the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" invoice should be deleted by stating in one company how it was discovered by the investigation of state representations, as a road transport activity carried out, which was not carried out by an investment consultancy firm.
The fact that the invoices were issued by Egy√ºtt and Harmadik √âvezred√©rt and the companies XXI. In addition to the false culturalist Egyes√ºlet and Biztos Pont, there was also a breach due to the formal deviations - the inappropriate format of the invoice and the wrong mark.
Like in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfeh√©rt√≥, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be presented.
For example, the criminals did not even notice that the company HIB s. o. from Ny√≠regyh√°zy was in the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal V√°ros√©rt, in the liquidation, was fed, so according to our information, the liquidator of the company also claimed that he would issue the paper.
Facts Showed by Knowledge
The second group of invoices is made up of those who knew they were going to exhibit a fictional invoice.
The Es√©ly Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million funding for the Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Foundation at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialist√°k.
Collab s. r. o. filed a complaint to issue a fictional account one of the accused Ludovic Gy√∂rfi.
With Zuschlagem and his associates, Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 retained the contributions of Job J√∂v √©rt and Atlasz and V√∂r√∂sfeny by invoices worth about five million forints that did not have real economic activity.
Nor is the movement of money, because the invoices created were later removed, which, however, the organizations have forgotten to put in their documents.
Other groups of invoiced companies are those that were bound to the defendants.
For example, Iv√°n Kubatov was a representative of the Ukrainian counsellor Delta Tri√≥ s. r.o., dealing with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company presented a number of invoices for the sale of computer technology, worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found in the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the cash investment company Cash Ltd, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
One of these companies was a man from Romania, who was supposed to hand over the letters concerning the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, admitted that on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppa and the award of Egy√ºtt and Harmadik √âv√®vred√©rt and accepted their counter-assessment.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, Romanian citizens were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, none of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they had no job.
However, he was blessed by the companies because, at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their loading papers, he presented the company invoices to the Atlasz and Y-Gener√°cio connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the Company Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade dal Kubatov, a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
State representations concluded that Kubatov had reached 10 per cent of the amounts shown in invoices and VAT.
To exhibit fictional invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont team, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Gener√°cio and S√∂vets√©g and Modern Magyarorsz√°g√©rt presented proposals to the public competition Nadace Mikhalye T√°ncsicse (TMA), a well-established socialist organisation.
They obtained 500 thousand units, but did not put the amounts to the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home visit at the Office of Arp√°d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the examination of the defendants, he will probably describe the course of the production of the invoice, as he has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if everything is to be revealed by the chief accused J√°nos Zuschlag himself.
His statement today is not too detailed, and although he has promised to do so many times, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for saving a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, the socialists may have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it on himself.
He was still able to get hurt because his request to reduce the conditions for his detention, because of his being placed in prison, the staff were not heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have suffered much greater damage than they have done so far, can freely go through or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he has no option.
Psychology of torture: Why are we wasting more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to value goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior have been able to reveal to researchers from the field of neurology and the economy of the New York University.
According to their study published in Science magazine, people do not want to stay in the eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research using experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "games" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers agreed, the other group participated in the ransom auctions, with the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active area of the brain of the pilots.
In both games, participants were able to win money, however, during the auction game, which is important to interrupt the other side, began to function intensively during the loss of a whole located under the brain cortex called striatum.
This brain area plays besides many other functions in the "self-recompensation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible for researchers to explain how to avoid a severe reaction to the strike.
In support of their theory, members of the research team from a number of economies carried out a financial cross-cutting investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were invited against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned, and they made their comments.
The members of the other groups were also promised that if they get out of the game they would get another $15.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also paid for the money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was based on the fact that one was highlighted by the victory and the other loss.
However, members of the "anti-lost" groups were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "violent" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the effects of the auctioning joys of winning and avoiding the risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the difference between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to seek out a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, then in Hungary this chronic liver disease is indicated among the main causes of death.
The number of cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that the patient often does not know that they are infections.
The name of hepatitis is a general name for the infection of the liver caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, and there is a difference between the liver and the liver, but the cause of the disease and the disease caused by it.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis type A and E by grass-based devices (e.g. infested food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (sperm, secretion, spleen).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, against virus type C vaccine does not exist.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, usually due to nausea, weakness, chest problems, vomiting.
Then, on the skin and eye whites, there is a yellowish, bright chair, and a thin urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people worldwide die of a more serious type of this disease, of liver cancer, and of liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth of the infected medicinal product is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver surgery or cancer of the liver.
Most of those infected with their disease do not even know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells in particular, and the first symptoms will be delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular testing is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs more often than on average: between people who had passed blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
At the present time, the estimated global number of chronic hepatitis C 200 million infected individuals is estimated.
Since the disease can demonstrate an already routine laboratory examination, a person should, in case of any signs of unknown origin, refer to his doctor.
In temporary detection, the disease is therapeutic, the virus can be removed from the body, and prevent such infections and prevent cancer.
On September 30, the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organised by the organizations representing the disease first worldwide in 2004.
Its purpose is to warn of the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of the disease and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, it's so bad?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic, which could have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examined how man‚Äôs belief in the god of perception of pain has been influenced by the British Telegraph.
During a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting depicting Ms. Maria.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of detailed examination of the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate this part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
Research is the first of a series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out in such a way that the left hand of the test subject was attached to a pendant that issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to give a clear view of two paintings: Sassoferratov Miss Maria from the 17th century and the Lady with the border of Leonardo da Vinci, dating back to the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of Ms. Maria would give the believers a certain state of worship, while da Vinci‚Äôs image was chosen because it did not differ from the first too much and acted according to them with a soothing sense.
The pilots spent half an hour in the MRI scan and during this time they got in four consecutive parts of 20 electric shocks, while watching the picture separately with religious or general themes.
The Catholics said that in view of Miss Maria, they felt "safe" as if they were "old" and "feel free, fill them with peace".
When watching the image with religious themes, they felt 12 percent less pain than Leonardo‚Äôs work before.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, is of the opinion that the same effect can be achieved by means of any powerful visual image, even in atheists, only to find the right photograph.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of how the effect on the regulation of the pain of believers should be if they were to show them some of Leonardo‚Äôs Madonna or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean a look at Miss Maria's quality to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
About their tenth birthdays, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above; they know where they were on vacation, what they're going for and what they're interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics, making parallels with Orwell's dark vision, these are not the very very clear basis of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather more personal data about users, which is necessary for the founders of Google to keep their original intention: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to the spokesperson, the company is standing after ten years of secular work just before it can work with all the information.
On the question of what will be in five years' time, Schmidt replied that if Google could answer questions like "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would actually be worth it?" - for such simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know about users enough information.
Not all users of the Internet are well aware that the exact search words and the IP addresses were searched and on which sites the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service started two years ago, users can, for example, keep the history of their surfing, look back at what they were looking for and click on, and then generate in the long term the findings adapted to them more directly - on the same logic, the Recommendations service will also be based on which we will have a system based on the above-mentioned and retained preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with?
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the firm is more terrible than the reaction does not produce in internet users awareness of guilt, fear of torture, desire for freedom or even resistance to power.
However, it is confirmed that not only are all the expressions sought caught, but in justified cases a third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users do not play a role.
The most well-known example of recent times has been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedofils, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedofils from the community side of Orkut, established through it.
Internet users who are afraid of personal rights, however, could still breathe in May when the company has successfully proved its truth in the fight with the FBI by hand with the EFF electronic rights organisation: Google must not be forced to provide any information that is secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms that it received with a call for reinforcements before the year of the adopted law on the protection of children, however, it failed to obtain the lists of individual user search items, the full lists of websites and key words for a period of two months.)
The view on Google is quite controversial: it is supported by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by using Google services, which are exposed to hardship, and they come out against it with a revolution that belongs to supranational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek of culture and its wild link, gathering around itself excited computer fans, activists and users, who appear in many countries, in it sees a new generation of giants, "corporations that are now more expensive", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as the world's recipients, as they both fight for the same goals.
This may be caused by the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; the open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package of programs acts as much more accessible, younger, "cooler", than the practice of official software.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship of the internet and the personal rights that has brought them just one of the most screened key words in recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
A average young person can lead a profile right now on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can communicate peacefully with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording his listening music, all of which can then be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides, he can write a blog on which his latest photo gallery will be automatically released, which will be stored on Flickr or Picasa.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she explains: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of shared friends will easily find out who her shady friend spent the evening with, or the company can only throw out his employee because on his blog he will fill out his honest opinion on top of the story: one is sure, the concept of private life has completely changed today.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis that is hiding behind today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has a chance (like Scroogl, who uses the Google search system, however, does not deliberately affect the trails).
For example, a small number of people are not allowed to register on community sites so they can not be found. Online Google application from the text editor by photoeditor and the reporting portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to large server parks and that do not provide us with the best possible profile.
Public opinion doesn't expect much secret when Google shows teeth.
The company has a current value of $156 billion higher than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being introduced at a fast pace seriously harming Microsoft's life not only, but also a number of other software designers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints of disturbing perception: for example, top management rejected employees' protests after it led to a double fee for corporate school, at any rate the daily feeding of employees according to company management was too costly, all of which, however, was lost by Google in 2006 before the Chinese government and in the meaning of their agreements filtering out any finding that is due to the good taste, the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never pre-indicates new services, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be avoided by the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines has such dimensions that it will soon have something to do with the US Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good source of material for the next generation of ski-fi writers, the famous new Cory Doctor's "Scroogic" describes the future with Orwell's reminitions, in which one can quickly approach the person with data from Google.
A double killer from the Uzda helped to remove the tracks of two young people
Two young people listened to the police in the case of a double murder in Ozda, according to a reasonable suspicion they helped to eliminate this crime, said in a Tuesday speech by the Chief Police Department of Borsod County.
Persons who have been suspected have been found and are currently accused of assisting a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to the information provided by the MTI two girls, are on their way to freedom.
Helping a criminal is punishable by the deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspected of double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old man, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a crime in front of a couple of planned homicides for other reasons.
During the investigation, it appeared that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old a larger amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so he put his believer out last Wednesday to an operation in Ozda, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared to commit a crime, as he also testifies that he had committed a murder weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered a Warsaw stock exchange for buying a percentage package of shares of Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, although the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who wants 60 percent of the securities sold in a few months.
As the Czech economic journal E15 writes, Poland's offer represents the highest amount of interest for the Prague Stock Exchange has been offered so far.
According to the Czech lists, the offer of the Vienna Stock Exchange of precious papers, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange of Nasdaq, New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B√∂rse were presented.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not rule out that it could lead to the destruction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by the stock market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank of Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by the Czech Sprinkler 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European lists
In its Tuesday's comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the pre-European lists already refer to "the second 11th of September".
We can thank the American President for the global financial disaster, who blames the Romanian La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to dry his own side in support of the quickly paid draft law, whose aim is to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second of September 11th.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the culprit in Washington.
In the opinion of El Mundo, he has brought the world economy to the brink of a dark lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, which will eventually pay the whole world for.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
World economy depends on air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be remembered, the female journal Tages-Anzeiger points out.
So far, individual States have been able to place a savings circle and taxpayers can save them from the collapse.
However, if other banks like domino dominoes are broken down, then money will no longer be enough, nor any other improvisation.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move across their national egoism and to bring together control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, well-known monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, who are concerned that, like the Americans, the crisis will have to sink deeper into the pockets and the European taxpayers, increasingly real.
The European Union is facing a crisis that, as a tsunami, is falling within the old continent until it has been seriously forgotten.
"Savers" do not have to have the thousands of euro at once, however, it would be good if they decided firmly, in which case it is reasonable to collect the taxpayer's money to prevent even more damage.
The smart car imitates the flying of an ass
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions unless imitation of the obstacles that occur in the world of nature?
For example, at the bee.
A strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was introduced to engineers from Nissan Chamber of Commerce. It was about how to build a new generation of anti-fouling systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan built a biomimetic robotic system for the management of the type BR23C, a robotized mine equipped with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the summer, each cook creates his own personal space of oval shape, which is very much like our safety safety package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Labels for the field of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes that allow the senses to see in all directions in the yellow angle more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers were able to copy the idea of a laser remote.
It shall identify the obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C in the 180-degree solar field, calculate their distance and send a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which shall immediately be converted into an operation aimed at preventing the impact.
The obstacle is caught during a second break, then the robotized car begins to simulate the motions of the joints and rotate the wheel to the extent necessary to prevent the impact immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this vulnerabilities are carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If that's not the case, the robot car wouldn't be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety protection package, within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid another bees.
This process must not last longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike the curve, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction to which the wheel can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by the rabbits when avoided, only the possibility of turning, speeding and slowing was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ionate variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, is less then storing data.
This mechanism must process and react only to a few incoming signals in the second.
There is no need to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it is still only a memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need memory with giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology that is currently being avoided, which, according to Nissan's estimate, could be achieved in seriously manufactured vehicles within ten years.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the target end goal after leaving the road.
The damn dear child already has a name.
The Savings Package Act of 700 billion dollars, which is to be divided into several instalments and whose purpose is to redeem the bank's non-quality loans, already has a written form.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended until Saturday after midnight in the United States, Congress representatives reached an agreement on a lasting debate on the rescue package of $700 billion, told the Agency Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the Snow House of Representatives, which says there is only a description of the agreement.
The compromise on the package also supported both President Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written image of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock in Washington time (then on Monday at 2 o'clock in the morning of Central European time), but no special entry into stock exchanges was possible.
The draft legal standard, which is heard on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be established, will be voted on by the representatives of the House on Monday, then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosio on Saturday night, then the news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," White House speaker Tony Fratto said.
The programme is still different from the original proposal of Bush's administration, in which it should have been intended to redeem the valuable securities secured by mortgages at a sudden cost of $700 billion.
It is now possible to spend up to a maximum of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter, as expected on Monday, will be decided by the Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages that are valued as non-quality, the remaining $100 billion judgement will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special meeting, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of the $700 billion will depend on the Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the sense of the law, apply a combined approach: it can at the same time redeem non-quality loans, mortgages and valuable securities secured by mortgages, and other "food" loans.
The purchase may take place in the auction and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry have notified.
The legal standard will allow the undertakings concerned to participate in the insurance programme, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees on the basis of the reasons for the concern, and then the company will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the American financial system, with up to $700 billion, whether it is an extensive purchase of bad funds, their insurance or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the large money institutions.
"We take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The banks that have been in trouble waiting for state aid can, on the other hand, be counted by the fact that their government is lowering their distance - which is simply called a "gold fall" in the sea slang.
In addition, these restrictions will depend on the way in which they are granted to the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys in the auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on gold deposits if the bank's directors do not fall in the balance of income.
In the case of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the government shall aggressively step forward in order to ensure that the money for management is not overcrowded.
It should be added that the existing Gold Fall Treaty does not change, the restrictions apply only to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"It is one of the first cases in American history when there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of general directors," commented the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the shadow representatives, Democratic Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will become a participant in banks with the right to share programme, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and together with it and the saved bank are put on foot, they can also make the transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal determining how taxable taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides in connection with the plan of doubt.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, this is the dollar of taxpayers not to save," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague, Ohia Mary Kaptur, judges that exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street were required to adopt the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to grow
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008, compared with 12.9 per cent in August 2007, according to the Central Statistical Office.
The export sales prices in the industry increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and averaged by 3.9 per cent.
Production prices in the industry were, as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, more than 0.7 per cent, with an average of 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 per cent in the previous month.
Moreover, domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
In August 2008, the highest price increase in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase in the beef and veal production sector by 4.6 per cent, respectively, of footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other processing industries, we measured an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and development sector, which are of high importance to the domestic industry, the price increased by 0.3 per cent in August, particularly by the continued impact of the officially established increase in the prices of gas from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of the domestic stay in the individual processing industry, prices grew most in the oil processing industry (32.4%).
In the steel industry, 13.2 % of the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products, which are of decisive importance, was observed and the price increase increased by 11 %.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other processing industries, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water industry exceeded the prices of 18.7 per cent in the previous year.
From the point of view of the sector's focus in August, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was observed in the sectors concerned with the production of material assets.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, due to the previous month, prices did not change.
The highest price increase for the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured an increase of 6.8 per cent in prices, in the case of substantial assets, rather than a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in the forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
During one month, our domestic payment declined by 1.7 per cent in view of the euro, then by 7.1 per cent in view of the dollar, compared with August 2007 it increased by 7.5 per cent in terms of the euro and by 15.9 per cent in view of the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to King G√∂nczov, there is a great hope that around 12 January the US-Madjerian agreement on wireless communication will enter into force, foreign ministers spoke about it in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "it is now almost entirely up to the fact that an electronic system for the approval of the road is being built at sea, respectively."
At the same time, she pointed out that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to leave registration before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today continues in the negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezzo Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order to the merits of the Republic of Hungary and conduct talks with the Foreign Policy Adviser of the Presidential Candidate of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for bank savings packages
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidents of both major American parties, agreed on Sunday to provide their support for the bank's government package of $700 billion, although they are also politicians who require a delegation of finance ministers.
After several marathons of the Congress and the administration representatives were announced early Sunday morning: the basic bank package agreement was concluded.
The financial package, aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, became a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is commonly referred to as the most appropriate of both candidates, which would bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most thorough research at the same time as they got to the front of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain advantage again, and McCain's jump took place after the Republican Convention of the appointment of Sarah Palin as Vice-President.
Obama said on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit that the package law of 700 billion would quickly be adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passports relating to consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We need to act immediately, responsible (...) to your places, savings, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy threatens the danger," the 35,000 dam said.
He didn't let himself miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy to the elderly.
McCain, in his interview with the ABC TV station, explained: "All of this will be a little bit of a cause (...) but it's just not possible to do business."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal provides for the establishment of a commission to oversee the finance and the limitation of the derogation for the top-level representative to which it lasted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, but he was himself in contact with the minister on a daily basis.
The president of the House, Nancy Pelosiov√°, announced on Sunday that the representatives of the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
Print preview of the German language
The real camp is unbreakable, only the voters within it have become more self-aware - thus analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are prepared to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalitions.
The mirror (speckle.de)
In the online issue of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter chooses in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Feeds Your Father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion began a long time ago before his office took over Beckstein-Huber's sad duo.
For decades, Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The settlement of the period is, however, a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and this is also for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not completely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday, it ended the process that could have been predicted for almost ten years: it ended the inconsistency of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, first of 50 years below the 50% limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has carried out in this country and which is fed by its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but in the race they have been very wrong. Secularization, educational results, settlement of the Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the result of the loyalty of the CSU's wishes.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, more critical, more self - centered.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has distanced the most from the classical civil level; people in the free profession, the nutritionists, the graduates and the university education.
The CSU's support has already dropped by 40 percent.
The Presse (depresse.com)
The conservative Viennese journal, in its article entitled "Who, Who? The Presidents are in the questions of the detention coalition" refers to the confused internal political situation created by the Austrian elections.
SP√ñ wants to deal with the OVP.
The OPCW advocates the integration of the SP√ñ into its internal affairs.
BZ√ñ appears to be open to all negotiations, greens do not yet want to be placed on the wheel.
The elections are behind us, now everything is around the coalition; in the debate organised on public television, the presidents did not allow themselves to be looked at in their cartoons.
The president of SP√ñ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to deal with the OVP.
And SP√ñ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some social countries and in social partnership.
The question of whether he would introduce himself to the coalition also with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the OEP, as Vice-Chairman, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Sch√ºssel-Multiterer course has been voted on for every fall.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded to the red offers carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the EEA.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition, it is still quite open on the part of the party, these questions need to be discussed definitely within the EEA.
BZ√ñ President J√∂rg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black coalitions, we are prepared to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
J√°r√≥kov√°: It is necessary to break the charmed circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which this year is hosted by France, the current Presidency of the European Union.
L√≠via J√°r√≥kov√°, a Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the vocational training in its message, paid attention to the assembly in school, because it is one of the most serious abuses of Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The Summit started - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir ≈†pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
To date, representatives of the government, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the field of equal opportunities have been established.
According to Fidesz J√°r√≥kov√°, the press office of the Euro-Employed Group pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labour forces, the Roma are driven out of the European labour market primarily by their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, can only achieve a higher level of education in part."
The year has also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to establish awareness of these relationships in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Romanian children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the greater the chance will be to become a productive member of the labour market; by means of income taxes and consumer taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romans have the right of their state citizens of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to ensure the elimination of their lack of quality and separate education," said L√≠via J√°r√≥kov√°.
According to the honourable Member, the coherence of the European Union is needed with a view to achieving the immediate acceleration of the process of decoupling schools, which is important for the correct observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the charmed circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to allow Roma children the possibility of a democratic space so that they can participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," J√°r√≥kov√° asked.
Each of us, in the meaning of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, organised annually since the last meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The judgment of the obedient dove Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Even in the face of a shameful election debate, the debate on personal questions has so far been postponed by the points of the Bavarian CSU.
The president of Erwin Huber and Prime Minister G√ºnther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The judgment of the tandem, which has suffered the disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress last October weekend.
In any case, the members of the highly criticised dune were left to hear that they would not fall out of their ranks.
They tried to calm the angry members of the fraction and the basics who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavor cunams" issue of personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who stood at the top of his career - obtained a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength was sufficient.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18% of the German HDP "self-control" over 46 years.
They still have conservatives in the southern shack country, which has a key role for the Hungarian economy, a high position, but in the future they will be forced into the coalition anyway.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of the close intelligence team who launchs a trial on the possible collaborating of the municipal government with the liberal FDP, respectively, with a legally oriented set of free voters, will also be the Vice-President and the Minister of Agriculture of Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible successor to Huber's.
It is ironic that the free will candidate Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber, used the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the rifle, but with ambitious municipal policy, they made a very short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far played a role in the background, the former prime minister of the country and the former president of CSU called on the day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday Huber made several driving notes to the CDU, according to him, they would deserve much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkelov√° will not be able to become an office if the CSU, who played a significant role in the national success in 2005, will not be able to join forces on foot.
According to Merkel, who, because of the fiasco, was very difficult to hide his disappointment, would not lose the CSU position of negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: to treat the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 per cent of the worst result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposite - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexandr Lukashenko, namely by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) of the laws to which the counting of votes occurred.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative group of 10 million countries has been losing the opposition for ten years, the opposition combined on behalf of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the constitution in elections during the course of debate in 2006 and the numerous renewal of his presidential mandate, will "allowed" this time to appear in parliament by several opposition MPs.
That's how ODS has left the boycott before.
In the light of the opposition, Russia was increasingly heavily dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of Russian imports of gas, has consistently taken credit and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines in Russia, has been given access to Russia - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and the other high position of politics, there is no access permit.
In the evaluation of the pre-election campaign, the OSCE pointed to positive changes, rather than shortcomings - for example, to ban the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OBSE's Sunday flash report had already received invitations to the campaign, during which opposition candidates could essentially not appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, the opposition can only feel improved in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom and Minsk is willing to leave Moscow and the smaller confrontations, if he continues to refuse to recognise Georgia as a distraught South Ossetia and Abkhazia, perhaps Russia, with which Belarus forms the state of the federal state, considers these two territories to be independent for months.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that he started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevic.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to remain so, even though "it was too much to be left to the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, but rather tries to deliver his message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition lists in Russia, the distribution of obstacles to local authorities, but I can see that the change supports the more people, even among older people," Milinkevic said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not constitute the right and officially the most supported level of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security is being 'exposed of silent graves'," Milinkevich judges.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers have assessed elections as democratic.
The leading Community mission of independent states Sergei Lebedjev, Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the disappearance of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From breakfast before work"
It is the first in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was introduced by the turning door at the arrival and departure of the employees.
However, from now on, this new action will begin to work against the anointed, against those who are drunk and then go to coffee at work.
The news against the Lenochs was presented today by Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetto, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services" the Minister explains.
"This will open up a new period of responsibility and transparency.
It's reformism," says Brunette.
The Chigi Palace will complete the establishment in all the buildings of the Council's presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a common procedure with workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunette smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Education School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally announce that during three months the inability of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60 thousand people more a year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay dynamics ‚Äì explains the Minister ‚Äì have doubled over the past 8-10 years in view of the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunet's decree in accordance with the Codacons-supported request.
"The Minister of Public Administration today presents figures concerning the lower absence of work due to disease ‚Äì writes consumer protection association ‚Äì the nation of 'pillar lenses' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and right-wing employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In Taru, there will be a protest against the exclusion of hospital supplements, which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which it is possible to monitor the time limits in which control visits will be carried out and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour harassment, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day in Italy, there will be 2,500 job injuries, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1,200 deaths due to job injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the order, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murders.
In order to refocus the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Labour Impact Victims set on the second Sunday of October.
"Anmil's disturbing data and the tragic news of these days confirm the importance of the issue of job security," says President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozen and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its keen interest in the continued joint efforts to ensure safety at work, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of families of victims and the participation of the public opinion."
"Naturally, we have been brought up to be 'suffered', frankly shared face-to-face with tragedy, which in their scope provokes a disturbance in the media and participation in public opinion, but every day reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a problem of sources: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, numerous initiatives are being undertaken in the field of education so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to note this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed, "as a result of the death of the job rate, it creates an absolutely critical social status, it attacks the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to put an end to this state."
"As regards the work impact data, it seems to show a certain positive turn, but it does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from the job losses is so alarming," said President Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We don't want this "decreasing effort" to lead to less attention, because it's just as soon as the attention gets up, the tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general it is still too little to stop the problem of impact and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to engage more strongly in the training of workers, and this from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public participation.
But there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli has finally declared that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation for the victims of work and the "relieve of support care" to which the system is being granted in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on the spontaneousness or the giving of time from time to time to the legislator."
Player Mp3 accused, exposed to risk hearings
Listening to longer sound music and using portable audio devices as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's Communication from the European Commission, which, in an official report extended in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently been identified and identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view ‚Äì we read in the notes ‚Äì it follows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable music devices, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a device at high volume, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can harm the unconsciouss in an uncorrected way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific research ‚Äì continues to be a leader ‚Äì there is a clear risk and it is necessary to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to raise the consumer and publish this information.
We need to continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists ‚Äì the executive officer of Eu ‚Äì confirm that care is needed and the European Commission now examines, together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be introduced and thus better protect children and young people from noise exposure, whose origin is portable musical devices and similar devices."
At the present time, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable audio devices to 100 dB, but raises concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by over-exposure of noise-like exposure.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions such as lowering levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will currently exceed the applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time may risk permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity can be counted between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Germany leaves a free course for the Commission for the future of the capital
We start today, we close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met in its new home in the morning behind the Caracall pool.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors will be closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official press" of Campidoglia and his council of Giannio Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas ‚Äì it wants to stress Germano ‚Äì it will have to ensure proposals for the development of Rome, which will finally be used by political decision-makers who remain in the joint and the General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, but it's just about trying to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved, because this institution must have a precise time limit.
In June ‚Äì the mayor announces ‚Äì we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has done for the future of the capital of Rome."
To the one who accuses the Commission of the non-reliance, given that its opinions will not be binding, the German branch: "All matters depend on the work which the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, like the Commission's Attali proposals, and I am sure that this will also benefit in Rome, it will be decisive.
Too often politics will pay for everyday problems and emergencies that will occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Roma Ombudsman wishes to stress that "this Commission is neither a surplus nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roma will not become a euro and serve to think and involve the best intelligence in the capital".
For Germany, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor inevitable, so that it is possible to allow our city to have an authentic rise at the level it needs, and to think in a unified spirit of its future."
The future, which explains the mayor of Rome "will not only be limited to the current general border, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal statute, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the capital city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are growing just as the date of the election is approaching.
One woman from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama is shy: he thinks he'll get to the highest post of the nation, which has two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are attacks of racial origin and do not answer the question of wishes: will it be a good president? And then we have research; they all say that Obama wins and with a great shock.
In this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the south coast of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling station we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There will be one page of American mentality on top, which has remained a bullet until the last minute.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of ourselves, who to cut off, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama was to win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
However, in spite of all this considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a spear in his ass.
In Iraq, the lives of 4,500 soldiers and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became for most of Bus' weakness.
Whoever gets to Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. Economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption of the future.
But today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not openly say that they were less concerned about confidentiality.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is for American money journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to put the newspapers together, they are a huge problem.
According to the polls, it is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
American journalist goes through clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press and senior executives are convinced that a national press release is a bad way.
In the local area, the performance group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for the press to see where the web is going.
More publishing takes the way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" print.
"Economic pressure" reported by journalists has increased to 79%.
Five hundred of the reporters in question admitted that they were turning to technology in the hope that their journalist would "do something good".
The biggest failure in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms ‚Äì that means leaders ‚Äì and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "security of work."
Leaders who think they're losing their jobs in three years are 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, they move 30%.
With regard to "just work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of the journalists are working on the contract.
In a huge nation like Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want, and so it is a question to take or leave.
Leaders receive almost always huge payments and the editor can make even ten thousand dollars a month, except for pension and insurance payments.
As far as the permits are concerned, the argument is complicated: a number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year until the 15 days after the number of years.
However, U.S. journalists, according to their own knowledge, are often ill during one year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN ROME, DANILO COOPOL ASSISTANCE IN GROTTAFERRATIA
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse the submission of an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at its own cost, he received last week's release from his home prison, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the business with realities could change the place of stay from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which was referred to as pm) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused of.
Elity in Danger
This show was already shown a few days ago, when the Comora of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and interested in the persecution of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It is also confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, a calmer, closer to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, which is on the contrary conservative, hostile towards "the one from Washington" and to the world of finance, mainly in the states in the Middle and South.
The soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote that I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic downturn already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe it seems that this crisis works as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are being absorbed in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the renewal, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed the crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong strains abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single country are included.
This created a political problem for those who run it at the same time: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, who are also voters.
The short crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
The political internationality seems to be essentially out of play or that there is nothing to add: the clear evidence given by the European Union, which is always divided as between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided on for a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the government's initiative of every single state, saving plans, revitalizing the market, new rules and mainly the distribution of funds: when we get to the press, only the States have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And also their own necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of irresponsible values, under certain circumstances which, perhaps, no market and no international organisation will ever be able to afford in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, is still in full line with the growing importance that seeks to align recent economic progress with one factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the net, more sophisticated technology, more imaginary, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, we realized nothing about our future would have to contend with such little intangible things as water, cereals, oil.
All things that he would say can be moved from one place to another on earth, however, are in any case connected, absolutely, to restricted space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more karate in his hand than he is and who has the pity that he lives in a place without food, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper that predicts a break.
Anyone who talks about territory, state, government, is inevitably talking about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence effects are being created.
On the one hand, it is aware that it is objectively necessary for the authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can understand the situation.
On the other hand, there is a willingness to discredit existing leadership, in particular economics, which has shown itself to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense depressing: discreditation, intolerance, feeling inability and inability to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, however, that more and more is being spread in the broad masses of the population of belief than their actions are the same as the opinions of the popular elites so far, like their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of words, that the elite has already overcome its time and is negative to the opinion of most.
The demand for leadership is short-lived from the ground, but strong movement for the removal of ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is reflected in the upcoming elections or unexpected changes in collective power in the last and most recent period, from the conservative entry into Austria-Bavorska to the fall of laborers in Britain, to the support of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps to do what is to win the right in Italy).
We feel that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, and their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their formats, they have more problems to understand, so to represent, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, growing, potentially overcoming the cloum.
Before that, it would be a mistake to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly cannot say that it means having open eyes.
Super adhesive for walking around the walls
Overstep the laws of gravity through the super lepidle and walk through the walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is an object of various American research centres, and now the team of four institutions is very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep the stochylogram body glued to the vertical wall using adhesives of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM ‚Äì American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material produced by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon tubes.
"The base of the glue can be represented as a series of tubes set up as an organized heap of spaghett" explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of a gecon, covered with microscopic chaps, which allow animals to ensure a perfect landing.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the knives of these beaches and at the same time "simply fades away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a provisional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
I hope to walk around here like Spiderman? Maybe I do, but the researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the carbon tubes are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering .
For the time being, there's no super hero.
A further study ‚Äì The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced a adhesive made of micro-fibre hair that is itself cleaned from dust by moving onto the surface to maintain perfect attachment.
Medicinal products: never with Juice
Attention to the grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer, because they are refreshing and full vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their experience changes to improve or reduce their effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To make David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, stressing the risk of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the consumption of some medicines, at the just 263th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, calls for a new shock: only one bottle of grape, orange and apple juice to reduce the consumption of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose the health of patients at risk.
The flu juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to the toxic level.
LOCATIONS IN THE RISK ‚Äì The Italian medical agency itself announced in the information bulletin two years ago and advised doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this medicine and to give attention to what they drink in the event of taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
NEW GRAPEFRUIT ‚Äì According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that digest the drugs.
A long list of effects caused by grapefruit and other Juices.
From this point of view, Michele Carruby, director of the Pharmacovigilance Department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are reported by most immediately to the most diverse international and national medical agencies, which may arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you get and if you encounter something unclear, do not be upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for ansa‚Äôs explanation.
Nobel Prize for the Economy of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novoken√Ωan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, in the days of Enron's execution, Krugman predicted in a comment issued in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences in the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prediction that caused a conflict of controversy and that had been calculated after years, however, proved to be accurate.
¬´I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, particularly critical of Bush's excess liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have a third issue of the package "anti-Microsoft" here.
It's Open Office.org 3.0 issue day, an open source personal product package that aims to explore more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide audiences with different news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window are added further, far more important, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also attached to cooperation with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as allowing to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF file to the graphical implementation model and keep the original page view.
From this point of view, we can still create documents "PDF hybrids", which are similar to typical Adobe format graphics and have properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: it is excellent to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on change, each co-worker is assigned one color to comments in order to be clearer identification in the audit phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should stop the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent to the house or the workplace on request.
And if the free theme can be the theme of enlargement in households, it is in the Open Office's commercial field that the package is very good, and it can already be counted with the various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replaces Word; Calc is a table processor that focuses on the replacement of Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, at last, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5th million downloads, and when we consider that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the issue of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can also be overcome.
Also the results of the Kohl are positive, it's the fourth case of breast-feeding
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's Bernhard Kohl's Raku≈°a, from Gerolsteiner's team, third-class and winner of the best peak trick.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
26th year Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Ceru, Epo third generation, after italec Riccard Ricc√≤ and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohla are among those that have been carried out in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If control analyses confirm the positiveness of Ceru, Raku≈°an loses third place on Tour and will have to face a two-year disqualification.
The report on the positiveness of Kohl in the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who announced that he had already informed the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26th-year-old Raku≈°an was placed on stage winners for Spanish Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, also won a scored trick of the best peak.
IMGRANTS: The new York team is looking for, is italian racist?
Italy "as the country of immigrants has only turned into the last house for the priority of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Is this a beautiful country for racists? This is how one long article of the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdullah William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole the box of droughts.
This case illustrates what the New York Times defines as "Northern paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-hospital thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lego, which seeks to halt immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the climate change in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students with expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research, Sunia, rental committees, the student can rent a single room in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Ev has already achieved such dimensions that the whole class of students have lost the right to study due to the total too high prices that their families would have to bear ‚Äì explains the leading office for Sunia, Laura Mariani ‚Äì in this city a large demand from the students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of price growth that has also grown on residences."
In most cases, rental offers include several infringements: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with the lease.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional effort to regulate prices through the revision of the tax.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) is above the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence there is one bed on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, there is a need for 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single year) in areas close to other universities (Ostense and Cinecitt√†).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, there is EUR 300/450 bed, room from 400 to 600, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinica, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want for bed 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most frequent event for students from countries outside the European Union is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italians.
By the old movie Paradiso, the cities are ruining historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of multiplex.
"The city without a movie is like a blind man, it's like a face without an eye."
The picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully records what is happening in large Italian city centres, as well as in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the production of large multi-sales in the suburbs and the subsequent destruction of mono-sales in the central areas of cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
Often, historical places are filled with memories," it's as if we came to know a friend, a well-known person with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotion," says director of New cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornato Oscar and a large wedding award in Cannes, who told the poetry of a rural cinema and the grief of the way of life that the movie lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have been closed, and the highest bill has been paid mainly to rooms in the most important cities: 10 minutes in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions, the most affected closures are Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 Chinese halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their movement is the approach to multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 are paid more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian procedure has developed in a nationwide way" says Paolo Protti, president of Anec," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survive, because when one movie closes the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then we are not talking about insufficient funding for operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Supporting the sector would require between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million per year‚Äô.
An interesting case is the Bolognan case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closures and which has decided to find an easterly signature of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include tax incentives in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to air to the restricted transport zone and will have special stops prices and in some parking spaces.
‚ÄúI like this initiative‚Äù says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.‚Äù
However, it is certain that in order to be able to deal with the great power of multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to set up "New Paradise cinema", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I'm going through before the government or Quirinal on the streets of Nazionale, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the letters of black work, I'm turning to the other side."
Association between political and mafia group 'andranget', mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the city authority according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges against the Mafia Director in Calabria against the old age and the old age of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the old age of Rosarnar Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the railways too, Gioacchino Piromelli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"All legal and moral standards, as well as sound minds, were ignored," writes state representatives, when two local authorities expressed their desire to pay counsellor Piromellim's consultation.
"This would allow the Mafia groups ‚Äì the judges write ‚Äì to officially enter the city's authorities and thus make it easier to control and manage public administration."
Agazio Loiero, President of the Caleb Regional Commission, does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and the organised criminal sub-world are much more in his country: "There are areas where the focus of mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that address the pressures of 'andrangets, heroes that are still unconfirmed'.
The arrests from this morning are followed by the arrest of July last year , which the police showed that the Mafia group of Piromelli received a final arrest .
Since the end of April last year, the City Council of Gioioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the reason for the alleged link between organised crime and local administration has also been the local policies that have been abandoned in the general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, president of the Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the dissolution by the head of the right-wing coalition after the election in May.
He shouted for a scandal when Prefectura ordered the General Council to be dissolved.
He called for the responsibility of the former Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of drawing up everything for political reasons, but the judge in the prison regulation signed this morning explained that the Mafia Group had even reached so far that she requested a change to the A3 remote project.
From the other polls directed against Dal Torreno, written by public prosecutors, "the intention to move the demands of the business operator, the representative of some larger groups is very close, as is generally known, to Piromellim and to adapt the choice of public administration to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy comes from the wool, they get into the game big.
It is an infinite layer that covers more than 70% of the earth‚Äôs surface and is now being introduced by large global energy companies.
The waves, flow, flow, flow are the new sources of unexploded energy, on which the air of the wheels like Chevron is now trying to stretch out your hands to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis has intensified research.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went side by side, but now the environmental organization and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 said that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave of the sea.
This amount would be a double amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and flow and flow and flow.
It's an attack.
the company that planted the marine energy was Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to set up the facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, which is based on marine energy, more and more companies are based on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology ‚Äì he spoke to one company, which is linked to the oil cycle of the United States, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal ‚Äì and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the project to use marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we take into account that the oil is still heavy on Alaska, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new return.
In addition to Chevron, they follow the sea energy trail i Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and even invested sums, even though they are not well known, show increasing interest among observers.
Technology, the keru needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still at the beginning, because they do not know what impact it will have on the use of marine energy in the environment.
Meanwhile, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technology with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of colors that are connected to each other.
The force of the wave, which moves with the colors up and down, is changed by means of the waves and cylinders on the hydraulic pressure inside these colors.
Pressure triggers the turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy's getting on the shore with underwater cables.
Meanwhile, in the project phase, there are four devices of this type waiting only for federal approval and part of energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping center and parking space using six pdmarian turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the flow and flow causes the rotation of turbines, which is a living generator by this movement.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide, and after the tide.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential for affluence and affluence, says the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is an inconsistency factor, flux and flux are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely in the energy sector that the state, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, has already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investment up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
