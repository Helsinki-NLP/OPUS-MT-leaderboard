The House of Commons is concerned that they will be confused with the "mapet"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of the Netherlands).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political group are worried that such a thing will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Working Party said that his shift was concerned that "it would be disproportionate to the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers other than Oil: In general, the word "twp" means "slow" and the word "pwp" means "slow".
One Plyde MP said that the overall extension "was not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
One Wall conservative said his extension was "open-mouth" about the change of name, but noted that the MWP word does not go far away from the word "mapet".
In this context, the oral letter w is similar to the English speech of Georgesair of the letter u.
The Parliament's Committee, which is currently drafting the draft amending the name, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will naturally be the case of the Members themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which were widely accepted for the appointment of the House as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission was in favour of the term "Member of the House of Commons" or WMP, but the choice of MWP is the one that gained greater support during the public consultation.
The Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus may be a difficult case for the President of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the way the House operates, including rules of decommissioning from the Member's position and the design of the Committee's system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name during the legislative debate.
In the chapters, the citizens of the GDR come to the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its name in the north is subject to territorial shocks and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Giorge Ivanov, President of the GDR, a war of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeef, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns are silent as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's nothing from both of them."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing in a different way today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood 's salon where the world is regularly frequented."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not hold back as long as the officials hope "and will return sooner or later to the point where they started".
The churches, in addition, can be replaced by numerous houses filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained nearby.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem metropolis black - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist Church departed in the 1930s.
A black church in the vicinity took possession of the building.
The property of St. Martin’s building took up a black church under the patron John Howard Johnson, who went to a shop shop at 125th Street, a basic trade street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's enormists took over the reconstruction and ordered the caravan.
The famous David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in the church of St. Martin, proudly called the caravan "the campaigns of the poor".
The expert who played the cartoon in July described it a little bit differently: "political treasure" and "adistant historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Inn, from the University of Michigan, also noted that he was the first black musician in the world, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to the Church of Riversaid 18 years ago.
Mr. Merigueder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What is happening in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and engineers, some of whom were adopted by the church’s leaders, and others from the point of view.
The author - the administrative body of energy, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter at the July summit on their concerns that the aim "would be able to convert the cost" to the body of resources, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the acquisition of the architects and workers sent by the church.
Some enerites have voiced regret that there is a lack of transparency on the part of the target.
Loaded 13-year-old sharks in California for hostages
Cancer attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during the landings for salmon in California, the first day of the summer, according to the authorities.
The attack was recorded just before 7 a.m. near the Bicon Beach beach in Ensinitis.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV to San Diego that he had had had sex with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child who was asking for help and approached by a team to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a scream of excitement because he got upset, but then he realized he was calling, "Something touched me!
Something touched me!"
His entire key had been opened," Hamel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water, "There's sharks in the sea!" Hamel added.
The boy was disembarked at the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego and his situation is critical.
The type of cancer responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Sailor Larry Giles stated in the type paper that the shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the cortex.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Point Bis in Casablade to Sumis in Ensinitis for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's projects exert pressure on the US retail market
The Sainsbury's is measured with the Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams placing cosmetic reefs in proportion to those of the multi-stationery, controlled by special staff.
In the context of the significant decline in the US retail market, which is up to £2.8 billion, which continues to be developed while sales of clothing and household items indicate a decline, the largest retail outlets will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country and spread to more stores if the sample succeeds.
The investment in the clothing sector is coming as supermarkets are looking for a way to refill the space in the reefs that once understood televisions, microwave ovens and domestic species.
The Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees there will also be more space with rifles with the company logo, just like those stores like Boots.
The supermarket launches its own Boutique series again so that most products are vegan - something that the younger consumers ask for more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to make its products available in two Sainsbury's shops, the one that opened in Croidton, South London, the previous week and the other in Shelly Oak, Bermiham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend in the market of small quantities of food daily at local retail markets mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Cooper, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that outlet stores would look more and more like multi-storey, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more food services.
The Sainsbury's placed outlet stores Argos in hundreds of stores, and also imported certain Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, a fact that supported the sale of retail types and became more profitable on the markets.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reinstate clothing and medicine was unsuccessful.
The Sainsbury's tried a partnership with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after an argument on how to distribute the profits from the pharmaceutical shops in the supermarket of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the drug business you placed 281 stores in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared to £ 125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play his own role in the project, adding an extended range of luxury companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our reefs to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for the cosmetics that question the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: an exception after Holly Willoby's departure from the 11 million-£ agreement
The winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is exceptional after the departure of the Holly Willoby TV from the 11 million £ agreement with the lifestyle company that has to be dedicated to the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoby doesn't have time for the clothing company and the accessories True.
Their business was similar to the Goop company in Guinnet Paltro.
The 37-year-old show show "This Morning," announced in Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoby made an exception to the winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their winning lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to dedicate it to its new huge conventions with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl of the television was admitted during a conference full of tensions on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlow, Bakighamsair, that because of the new symbols - up to £1.5 million - she would not have had enough time to provide the company with clothes and accessories True.
The company was similar to Goop of Guinnett Paltroou and appears to have doubled the property of Willoby, which is estimated to be at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoby announced in Instagram that he was going to leave Truely, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his outlying homes.
According to some source, "Truly was far from the top priorities of Holly Willoby.
It was about its long-term future, its source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved in the company.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products in the central offices in Marlowo ready to be made available for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the exhibition "This Morning", which is listed among the most commercial brands in Britain, could cost millions in the company due to the huge investment in products from trucks and candles to clothing and household clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife maintain close friendships with Jones and Tara Cap's wife for ten years.
Willoby founded True with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March as president.
Couples spend their vacations together, and Jones maintains a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television company.
Willoby is going to become the main face in the M&S campaigns and replace And McPartlin on the show "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were hard, and then we fell in love.
He was ridiculed for the criticism received from the media about a school that some would think does not belong to a president, as well as his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
Trab said the dead guy was a televisor.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trab as a major step towards the depuration of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "anti-response" from the US after North Korea's early disarmament.
On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"Let's go very well with North Korea," he said.
"We're about to make a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - ending the fire tests, releasing the hostages and returning the other American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual attitude to statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'president' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trab said, showing the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia hit a whole island, leaving thousands dead in their passage
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population was exposed, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it's quite difficult," said Mr. Shubung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team that will travel to Palo, it is not yet certain if the foreign staff can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Natural Disasters Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palo to find out if it would allow international organisations to contribute assistance.
Given the seismic trends that often affect Indonesia, the country remains unprepared against the wrath of nature.
While shelters have been built for tsunamis in Atse, the same does not happen on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palo, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters involve even more administrative care.
A large hospital that had stopped in Lombok for the care of the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new destruction.
President Joko Weidondo had at the centre of his election campaign the improvement of the disorganised infrastructures of Indonesia and spent simple money on the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding makes sense to Mr Joco's administration before the re-election next year.
Mr Joco also accepts pressure from the persistent phantom trends in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using swords, toxins, and other autographs of weapons.
Watch out: Daniel Sterizes Liverpool Issophore Against Chelsea
Daniel Steridge saved Liverpool from a fight at the Premier League against Chelsea with a bullet on Saturday, 89th in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sterize accepted everything from Sardan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team to lose by 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot at the back dock.
His effort was very high from the big area and ended up on the right side of the roads.
The ball finally fell over Cape Arizampalaga, who jumped to get it off and went into the tracks.
"I was trying to get this position, get to the ball, and players like Sakiri always play as much as possible forwards, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Steridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kande coming, I made a direct exchange, I didn't think much of it, and I did the juice."
Chelsea had a 1-0 show in the mid-year after the ball in 25 minutes from the Belgian star Enden Azar.
The Blue Attacker gave all the payout to Mateo Kovacchis in this game, before giving a shot with a false close to the center of the floor and running to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacchis did one in the middle of the floor.
Then he gave him a deep breath, driving Azariah to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defender and completed sending the ball to the back dock with a left heel in front of Alison Baker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples at the champs of Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stanto San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europe League on 3rd in London.
The tragic calculation of the deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia is 832
The calculation of the deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the declaration of the country's natural disaster service, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the earthquake of 7.5 degrees that struck the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters high, the representative of the service, Sutopo Puro Nugroho, said in a type interview.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police picked up 32 years, suspect, after murder of a woman with a knife
A murder investigation started after the discovery of a woman's body at Birkend, in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 B.C.E. with injuries from bullets at Grayson Mouse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect for murder.
The police asked the cops who saw or heard anything to report it to the police.
Officer Brian Ohagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to call anyone in the neighborhood around John Street and see or hear something suspected of communicating with us.
I would also like to address a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have written something to the planes from the Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have their information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the resident of Birkend and found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who think they can meet the woman came down to the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are in progress, as the police said they were in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that he was not allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what happened.
The householders were informed that it may be necessary to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer is taking a man to say that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with blood on the scene.
He kept saying, "He's scared."
At 2 m.m., two police vans were located through the police station and one outside.
The police were standing outside the hall watching the apartment.
Anyone has any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's novel in Parliament is the last monument affected by the philosophy of "recording history"
His exorcism would be a qualitative justice for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works by his imaginative quarter supporters.
However, Councillor Cromwell described Mr. Creek's proposal as "announcing" and "an effort to reinstate the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell College, said: "In this debate on the removal of the remnants, it was inevitable that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Empire would not be targeted.
The iconoccality of England’s bloody wars was not banned or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a member of the Cromwell family was killed for the actions of Thomas’s predecessor in the past century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the story of a personality that many believe is worth price.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a parliament's defender against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
This is a very precise matter, however, which is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the further development of our nation and Cromwell is an unrecognizable personality that represents one side of the conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy and worthy."
Homicide harms a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in Southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, who was only known as "Owan", was found with a broken artery in a lake near a pighouse on the market of Lioupansui in Guitsuo province, South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farm official is preparing to take pigs vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Zing, China.
He was brought to travel with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of a neighboring pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in his mouth in the pighouse.
The doctor's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were broken and broken," said the cousin, known as "Go", according to the Morning Newspaper of Guyana.
The security camera plans show Wyan to enter the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wyan or his cousin.
One market operator said in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage so that it does not attack anyone else, while the police have collected the evidence on the attack scene.
The Wyan family and the market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although in Spain, cases of swine attacks on people have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 - mile [295 - km] pig threw a farmer in Oylia on the tractor until the farmer's wife feared the animal to be removed.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was separated by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "inflammation".
"They're just having a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to do anything wrong.
We should just show them the proper respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa typhoon are going to bring extensive rainfalls in the Southwestern United States
According to the forecasts, typhoon Rose suffers as it moves above the coldest water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, the storm of Rosa will lead to devastating rainfalls in North Mexico and South-West America.
The power of the roses rose to 85 mph, making it Category 1, at 5 pm Eastern Time, on Sunday and found 385 miles south-west of Puda Euhenia, in Mexico.
Roza typhoon is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low wind pressure area has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and to move east towards the Western United States. As the Rose Bridge approaches the lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the South-West US.
Roza typhoon will bring rainfalls of 25 million in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical fluid together with the area of low wind pressure approaching will create extensive heavy rainfalls in the Southwest in the coming days.
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 million will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible floods in the desert.
Deep tropical fluids will lead to rainfall rates of about 5 to 7.5 percent per hour per day, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 million mines are expected to be located in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the dispersal of the tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended to avoid any movement by foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfalls can turn the flags into river basins and storms will cause local windfalls and floods.
The low wind pressure area will create some local heavy rainfall on the southern California coast.
The overall rainfall rate of more than 1 percent is likely, which may cause small congestive flows and lumbarity in the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the dry season in the region.
Certain divided tropical cans will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early mornings on Monday, before the scenes are extended late on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalls will spread in the area of For Korners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures fall in the Arctic, but in the tropical zones remain quite high.
Sometimes, this fact leads to very intense temperature changes at close distances.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between the Central American countries was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and the Group, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the following days, persistent high heat temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In most Central and Eastern USAs, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the East to parts in the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for time, there are several possibilities to observe temperatures above the average in the Eastern United States by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kawano's hearing
More than 20 million TV viewers have been monitoring the applicant's official submission to the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kawano, on Thursday and the woman charged with sexual assault, which is due to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blazi Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political indisposition continued, with television networks, to interrupt the normal flow of the programme for the last time in Friday: the agreement by the Mayor of Arizona Jeff Fleic to conduct a week's investigation by the FBI in relation to the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee of Georgia that he was 100 percent sure how he was at a party while he was a high school student, Kavano attacked her while he was drunk and was taking off his clothes.
Cavano, in a loaded deposit, said it's 100 percent sure that something like that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million TVs are likely to be heard on Friday.
The company postponed the average TV on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of TV viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To see this television in the right dimensions, it is a common size with what is being observed a football match of the play-offs or the Oscar awards ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kawano, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million TVs during the entire day’s hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, ABC is located with 3,26 million TVs.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Felix turned out to be a champion in the drama of Friday.
Following the declaration by the Republicans that he would vote in favour of Cavano, the CNN and CBS cameras wrote on Friday morning protestors to approve him as he was trying to enter the elevator for hearing from the Georgia Justice Committee.
He stood watching low for a few minutes as he was expected, living on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are helpless."
Felix said that his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors are closed, that he would have more to say in the hearing of the Commission.
All cable television and broadcasting networks were covered alive a few hours later, the vote of the Committee on the Justice of Georgia on the promotion of Kaban's candidacy in the plenary session to vote.
However, Felix said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, something requested by the majority of the Republicans.
Felix was partly convinced after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Party High Representative, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with Cuns and some other deputies then, Fleic decided.
Felix's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not concentrate the votes for the Cavan's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kaban.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of the plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in a conference with the Sunday Times.
The prime minister of Britain Teresa May comes to the Conservative Party Conference in Berminham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her own in the newspaper's front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is taking a serious criticism of the Chekers Plan for Brexit, saying the proposal for the collection of duties between Britain and the EU was "very unfair".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Dataon Simson for murdering the player in LSU
The police picked up a suspect for the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dataon Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder prison, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims's mix with Samson and, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the boxing.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and said they found signs of Samson's DNA, according to the WAFB that works with CBS.
After Simonson's investigation, the police said he admitted that he had wounded Wade fatally.
His guarantee was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by the East Baton Rose doctor who released Friday, the cause of death is the bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special working group, the police crime lab, the South University police forces and the citizens of the area for assistance in the arrest investigation.
LSU sports director Joey Allva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "researching and achieving justice performance".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre front guard raised Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 rimbuds per race last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU whale team, Will Weid, said the team was "concentrated" and "in shock" since Weid's death.
"We're always worried about events like this," Wade said.
Gastrointestinal emissions in Mexico City
The productions of ephastic tere from the ephasium Popokapetl have reached the southern neighbours of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the strike, after the activity in the country reached its peak, with a record of 183 gas and steel emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small seismic visions.
Images in the social media show a parking lot of cars covered with minute roof layers in neighboring Mexico City like Sochimilko.
The landowners observed an increase in the activity of the ephysium, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 drop in the central Mexico in September 2017 was observed.
The strike, known as Don Gogio, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan self-immunists in view of the vote on independence
Six people were gathered in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protestors in favour of independence with the order restoration units, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first anniversary of the vote on the decline of Catalonia caused by pollution.
A group of mass protestors for independence, which were held by the order restoration units, hatched eggs and dusted, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually covered by tourists.
Concludings were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to make the complications.
At times, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence called the phrase "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of demonstrators for the unity of the country called "Live Spain".
Ten people were hospitalized with microinjuries reported during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the area that supports independence one year after the declaration of the 1st October referendum as illegal by Madrid, which is still celebrated by the Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the arrival was low with those who objected to the independence of the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police authorities tried to stop voting at the polls in the area where violent complications occurred.
Groups for independence have held off on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event took place elsewhere, and it was necessary to take a different amendment.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence for Catalonia's prospects.
"We lived one of our brightest moments last night.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who were able to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they have won a victory of vital importance, although limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence have struggled to maintain their strength this year, with many of their most well-known leaders to be self-excellent or to be held in custody in the expectation of their legal role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puts, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protests for the police with his cell phone, said that the conflicts were fueled by both politicians and the two troops.
"The tension is growing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the pressure we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Arresting men after car crashing into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash into a dwelling in London.
The incident took place at Ballingcard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's blow won the Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first ball for Livingstone secured the victory
Prohibited Livingston surprised the Rangers by thanking Steven Gerard just for his second play at 18 games as a manager of the Iprox group.
Dolly Menga's blow made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with Hibernia in second place.
Gerard's team remains out of line in the championship of this season and faces the Charters, who have the eight-degree advance on the next Sunday.
Before this fight, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston in the middle continues its race in six games in her category, with basic coach Holt not to eat anything yet since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead a long time before he scored, with its impatience to bring the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a lead and thought he'd come a little before the end, but Alan Lithkow turned down his attempt by glancing Craig Halket's head away from the end.
The farmers allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could beat the visitors in free beatings and horns.
And that's how the important ball came.
The Rangers couldn't prevent a free hit, and Livingstone opened, Declane Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Menga, who took the sand and scurried from the center of the area.
Until that point, the Rangers had ruled over the ball but found the defense of the peasants unsurpassed and the security guard Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was throwing the ball off Kelly.
Scott Pittman's sword disappeared from the ranks of Rangers Alan McGregor's security guard, and Lithcow's sand came out at another liveston free blow.
There were many stalls in the Livingston area and they were constantly disappearing, while two penalties were asked - after Halket's revenge of the ball against the replacement player Glenn Midleton and one for hands - they were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alasder Lamod from BBC Scotland on Tonny Macaroni Arena
Thematic performance and results for Livingstone.
All of them, in particular, were exceptional, exceeding expectations in this unorthodox course.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to top form, but the scores should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave to the team with his arrival .
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joy Wearell on the scene throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not inspired.
As good as they were in the past under the direction of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was limited - only once they managed to pass the defense of the peasants and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed emotions in Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come up with issues such as human rights, type freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police excluded the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of which were from Kurdish origins - have also given this, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of demonstrators reflects the contested nature of a visitor treated by some Turks as heroes and others as dictators.
Traffic accident in Dutford: a dead bike after a car crash
A biker lost his life in a car conflict in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-story road in Detroit, on the south-east of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the ambulance's saviors tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict took place a few months after a similar incident, where a driver hit and abandoned a rider, who lost his life on the Cillner Street road, about 1.6 km away from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and the roads of the bus have been blocked, while the drivers have received instructions to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six policemen were injured in complexities
Six policemen were injured in injuries that broke out in high-security men's prisons, according to the Prisons Directorate's statements.
The shocks broke out in the prisons of this Magnificent Long Lauren in Worstersair at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have returned to deal with the shocks, which involve eight prisoners and which have appeared in a platoon.
The police were hospitalized with microinjuries on the face during the complexes.
A representative of the prison said: "A particularly trained staff has begun to deal with the incident in the prisons of this Magnificent Long Lauren.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be influenced by the police and may be subjected to a greater penalty."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are held in the prisons of this Magnificent Long Lauren.
In June, the Prison Administration was hospitalized after an assault by a prisoner.
In October of last year, the class rehabilitation units were called to prison to report serious incidents that broke out during which staff members were attacked with balliards.
Roza typhoon threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rarely a tropical blow to hit Arizona, but this is precisely likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remnants of the Rose storm will cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued exceptional warning notices for floods for Monday and Tuesday from the western Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, the southeastern California and Juta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Roza typhoon is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted on its tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a tropical storm or low barometer at less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Bridge Centre provide a rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other regions of the South-West States, including the Central Mountain and the Green Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rainfalls up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk from floods, the rain brought by Rosa may be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-West states are experiencing drought conditions today.
According to the U.S. Mining Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," said weather.com.
First, Typhoon Rosa will reach the shore of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the typhoon, in the morning of Sunday, Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Puda Eugenia, Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles per hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the shore in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
There may be severe rainfall in regions of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of between 3 and 6 inches from the Bay of California to the northwestern Sonora is expected, which is likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Juta late in the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by the Rosa typhoon or its remains is the very intense rainfall in Baha California, the north-west Sonora and the South-West States," said the U.S. National Typhoon Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and snowfalls in the deserts and floods in the northern regions.
Attack on Mindsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted murder after the detection of a 16-year-old who was injured by a knife in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Taras of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remained in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old, were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, AVon and Somerset police said.
The police are calling to present anyone who may have recorded on a video on his phone what happened.
Trab says that Kavano "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the unfair and dissuasive habits of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in Wiling in West Virginia.
Trab said that Cavano "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his demonstration process as a candidate.
Kawan placed it in Congress on Thursday, denied indictable and with a manifest movement of Christine Blaise Ford's claims that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also put a hearing in front of her claims.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Cavan that day.
"The vote to confirm the Court's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an excellent public service path," said the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the candidacy of Kavano, speaking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-elections.
"We have five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trab mentioned that the Republicans are on the mission of "resistance and prevention".
The first important procedural vote in the Cavan Presidency on the candidacy is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, the CNN mentioned a senior helper of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were taken away from the giant waves that devastated the coasts, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia, the authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Paul on Friday, when six - foot - high [6 m] waves struck the shore of the river, causing many to die and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami occurred after 7.5 Ritter earthquake.
"When the threat to tsunamis appeared yesterday, the world was still on the beach and it didn't run right away, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Puro Nugrocho, a representative of the Indonesian BNPB disaster management service, in a newspaper in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come only to him, drove cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the wall," Nigroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled to the ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people crawled into the trees to get rid of the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management service show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been burned and destroyed and a roof that is surrounded by water.
Transfers continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the huge earthquake in Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the individual bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a narrow circle, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he mentioned.
Nigroho described the losses as "exploded" and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that victims were found trapped under the broken buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nogroho said that the victims and losses may be greater along the 300 km north of Palo, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communication systems "have completely failed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Star said in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are directed to the affected areas.
"It's already about a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
He criticized the Service on Saturday because he did not inform that the tsunami had hit the Palo, even though according to officials the waves had arrived at the time when the warning was issued.
In a video posted in the social media, a man on the top of a building seems to be shouting panicble, trying to warn people down the road for the tsunami coming.
In just a few minutes, a wall of water pops up on the shore, scattering homes and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the visibility of the video.
Seismus and tsunami caused a major interruption of the flow, which also disrupted communications in the wider region of Palo, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began to send transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the miners still need unknown food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has been reopened only to contribute to the peace efforts and will remain closed until October.
A visit by President Joko Wyndondo to the decommissioning centres in Palo on Sunday has been scheduled.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia are more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palou, where workers found refuge in shelters from museums set up in front of their office, passed through disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Dosseba mentioned.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some breeding teams have taken the sad task of initiating the process of relief for the injured, some argue that they are not affected by foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the field of assistance to travel to Palo.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from outside can only start if the place of a transaction is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Star.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there is still no relevant decision."
As the second day went by in Palus after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and the family who continue to ignore hope that their loved ones will still be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less ferocious.
On Saturday, a little boy retired from a sublaw.
On the Sunday, the saviors released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days near her mother's dead body.
Gideon Subadon, a coach of the national team on the top of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing racers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddji, were his students.
"As the oldest in the sport of the elusive beach, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gideon was told how, when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released in the community of the auxiliaries, he began sending unknown messages to his opponents in Palo who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the sign next to his messages was a grey symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves broke off $26,750 during the automatic take-off machine in Newport and Levi.
In the morning of Friday, thieves broke $26,750 from Brink's employee who was supplying an ATM machine in Newport and Levi, according to the Newport Police Department's type card.
The driver had detonated an ATM machine in the entertainment set and was preparing to deliver other money, police officer Dennis McCarthy mentioned in the announcement.
While he was busy, another man "was running back from Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not assign the number of those involved in the event.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The Canaanite West rapper is changing his name to Yee.
Publishing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening for a long time to the gay Ye and has used this nickname as a title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present the new Yandhi album.
Instead of the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons", as the show creator mentioned.
Except that it is a summary of the professional name used today, West had in the past stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you," West said earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanie, which means "the only" in Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused of our own, everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Paf Daddy, P. Ddy or Ddie, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brader Love.
A former West co-worker, TZI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without paddles and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico swears that he will not use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lobez Obrador swore he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloodthirsty student oppression.
Lobez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatellko Square that "he will never use the army to drown the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when the left-wing student movements acquired roots throughout Latin America.
Lobez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are turning young people into criminal alliances.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fou Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment is added to the announcements made by various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good principle, as all the other countries remain so much in the US and we aim to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances that it will take place in the United States the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Li said in his interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The virtues of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) released this month from the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt editions, is Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the top arts companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that won the best American player Otello, while later he was executive of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Annex in China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotice Initiative of the Advanced Research Plans for Defence (DARPA), and was extended when the next will be carried out to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic area, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using authority from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to the holders of a doctoral diploma in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Art of Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money in American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Research Centre, to which partners from the business and academic world will be involved, and the White House announced the formation of an Military Commission on Technical Science.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation today invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months to set up a National Security Committee for Technical Science.
Macedonia's citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be divided into "the Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would spark a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, supports that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a confession on its territory and has practiced a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of the GDR.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a Boikotaz campaign has raised doubts as to whether the participation would reach the required 50 per cent to be valid for the referendum.
The question on the vote was: 'You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the consent of the agreement with Greece'.
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeef, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for GDP, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, to enable the young GHG to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because the lives of all of us will be safer," said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become final.
A majority of two thirds are required to change the name.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 m.
However, the participation only reached 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave the present 66 per cent of the registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zeef, the wife of Zorika and Dosko, voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country to open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Strumika of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vlantimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes that have been set by those who are going to win the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head high, not as partners of the second category," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Great Union."
Prime Minister Zeef said that NATO integration will bring multi-faceted investments in GDP, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaf said after he voted.
He said that a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the PGBM Institute of Political Research, a percentage of 30 to 43 per cent of voters, i.e. less than the required participation, would be involved in the referendum.
According to another survey conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote positively.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent of a vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the friendly government, from its failure to power last May.
Watch: The August Serb of Manchester City spends all of Brighton's defense to put a bullet in it.
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling were the Briton's defense winning the 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Ethand Stedium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro has shown himself to score easily in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker took everything in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the phase.
He's been through three Briton's defenses before he forgets about the open space.
Then Aguaros was found surrounded by four green players.
He ran over a defense guard, then away from several others at the edge of the large area of Brighton.
Then he gave it all to his left, finding Sterling.
The English guard made his first move to the area by returning the ball to Aguaro, who used his right foot to win the Briton Matthew Ryan's termite guard, scored to the right side of the line.
"Aguaro is dealing with some problems on his feet," Citi's trainer, Pep Guaardiola, told reporters.
"We said he was playing 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky that he scored the ball at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the sailors the original advantage in the struggle of Prime Minister Ligg.
This bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguaro got the ball deep in the Briton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back dock.
The gala guard knocked the ball on the wire just before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Zambian League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rain-Neckar Arena field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serger wants to win the Rockys.
As the Nyasionals were excluded from the play-offs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always competitive ranger is hoping to play Sunday against the Colorado Rocky, but only if there are still any effects for the Rocky in the play-off, as they are preceded by a game of Los Angeles Dozers in Nazional Lig West.
The Rockies have gone to the play-offs with their victory 5-2 against the Nazionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock up their first position in their category.
"A fool we don't have anything to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nazis have not yet announced who will be the original thrower on Sunday, but it is reported that they are tending to let the Ranger throw the ball.
Serzer, who will make his 34th start, has made preparations on Thursday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has performance 18-7 with average score (ERA) 2,53 and 300 out due to strike in 220 2/3 periods of this season.
Trab speaking in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kawano, in his speech on the importance of Republicans' participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done is undercover in November.
We have five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but in fact it is like I am and, for this reason, I travel everywhere to support an excellent candidate," he said.
Trab went on to say, "You see this stupid, stupid group of Republicans, you see what's going on right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission of "resistance and prevention".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, characterizing the Republicans "depressed and wicked, fools and liars."
It was referred to the Judicial Committee of Georgia by giving a nominal reference to the Governor of the Republic of Denmark, a report which was accepted with potential public approvals.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer.This was a really bad use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not acceptable to those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum's activists in my local team voted for a bribe.
In addition, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party to whom they said they were not welcome, precisely because we are saying our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion for a bribe was criticized because I made contact with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, unfairly, for similar issues with which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The invitation to the South-East Labour Conference on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all".
During most of the eight-year-old who I am a local worker, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flattering, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever really begun to be implemented.
It is increasingly apparent that the different views are not acceptable to the Working Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
This started a little after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues I had previously considered to have had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 members and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they concerned national security or the single EU market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I really said, I heard a social media exam, where some asked for my rejection, got rid of the center's politics, and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a winter of sexual or racist assaults every day, but they never fail.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how attacks are considered to be more normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of intolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that with any proposal for a compromise or a change in the rules of choice, the limits of the party are narrowing.
I've been advised not to stand up for the last two years, not to talk too much, and so "everything will be fine."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the government of Thacher, which has led mainly to my entire class failure, my goal was to provide better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy and I have done the same in the last elections.
No one in Southingham East could have confused in any way about my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the proposal on Friday, the only thing I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will affect our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am faithful to the head of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to Momentum's members in Southingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political will will prevent me from acting as I believe it is for the best of your all.

Ir - Melrose: 38 - 17: The Invisible Ir ascends to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ir was worth triumphing in this extremely fun today's Ted's competition.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only non-existent group of the ten.
Finally, it was her upper defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which brought the yoke to the farmers and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still useless, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Congratulations in Ireland have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's ball in 14 minutes, with Fraser Klimo's conversion, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scotch's Rory Hughes, who was committed to the game by the Wariors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital advantage and Jason Bagcott noticed a ball without conversion.
The climate has increased the spread of Ir with penalty, before it scored, just in the mid-year, a ball with conversion, leading Ir to the depots with score 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half-yearly good and Patrick Anderson's ball, with Bigcott's conversion, reduced the progress to five degrees.
There was a long wait because of a serious injury by Ruard Nott, who was removed by a truck, and, after the resumption, Ir increased the difference with a golf course by Stafford McDonal, with climate change.
The replacement chief Blair McCarson then took a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the digital advantage with Bruce Colvin's golf without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The farmers, however, returned, and, when Struan Hatcinson took a yellow card for a taklin in the climate without the ball, from the penal line, McCerson scored a bullet at the back of the attack that Ir caused.
Climate has made a transformation, as it has done almost again since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's cluster and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth floor of the fields.
Still Game main player starts a new career in focus
The lead player of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series shows ready to switch to the focus industry after it has been revealed that a director of an licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the role of the BBC's popular show, which he writes and in which he competes with his former partner at Greg Hembfil's comedy.
The couple announced that the next fifth round would be the last of the show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after the gagland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of the company Agingermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, even though the source of Scottish Sun was denied that Kirnan wants to deal with the "abundant focus industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Closed Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to Peace
The sailors are traveling to the fully equipped captain of the ship in La Paz.
In public buildings, there are blue flags.
At the base of the sea from the Lake Titika to the Amazon, the sentence is written: "Our sea belongs to the right.
It's our duty to take her back."
Throughout the siege of eastern Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s coast after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as well as the laity of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been renewed more than ever, for decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course awaits the result with a positive eye," said Roberto Kalzandila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice to large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's condemning Chile, after ten years of silent talks, to negotiate the granting in Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the award-winning president of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has a lot to win or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide for Bolivia and that even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN agency in the Netherlands has no power to give thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued just six months after the final proceedings has been presented suggests that the case "was not complicated", Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law, said.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has narrowed the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Moral's aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood in Chile, he has supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Alberto Rodríguez Velzey, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end up in 139 years of mutual benefit disputes," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who still is one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political decanc.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must go beyond the past."
North Korea declares that there will be no nuclear disarmament if the US cannot be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Young Ho, says his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey seems ready to start the nuclear diplomacy he had completed three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Young Oon.
Ri states that the view that the continued sanctions and the refusal of the US to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point require the North to "get back" is a summer night's dream.
Washington claims to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pininging does not make major disarmament movements first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trab, want a second summit.
But there is widespread speculation as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering declaring a weapon that the country probably considers to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pioning next month to prepare a second summit of Kim-Trab.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available in some store near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of different super-magnetic hats in the passarela for their 2019 Spring-Calochary collection that stole the show in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely rare chapels opened Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the parasol.
The piece he forgot from Valentino was an excessive bench hat decorated with a plate of glass that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other super-magnetic accessories were carpus decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also introduced a series of strange masks, over the time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks had rusted lips and were more inflamed to Hannibal Lekter than in high-receptive fashion.
One creation brought to mind the complete equipment of sprays with a breather and glasses, while another resembled molten ice in a hole.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The superimposed hats made their appearance very quickly after the La Boba, the fish hat with the very platoon table we've seen wear so many, from Ryan to Emily Rataikowski.
The popular company that created the extremely impenetrable hat that has exposed the social media sent another great creation to the pasarela, a fishy beach bag almost as large as the model that carries it by wearing its magic.
The dark orange bag of raffs, decorated with silver raffs and a white leather grip, was the piece that disappeared from the collection La Ríviera Anoši-Kalokari 2019 of Jacquemus in Paris's Fashion Week.
The distinguished styleist, Luke Armitaz, told the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see large chapels and large beach bags in the shops next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excess accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with still a number of excellent results in the studies, which have simply been reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the career they will choose as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, then what you say is in his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say is in his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply be based on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of the annual surveys, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance points, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages succeeded in a degree of unemployment A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a degree of independence A in the Mandarins, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as a choice, as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 U.S. Employment and Skills Committee survey revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers had difficulty covering jobs, 17 per cent of the grade was lacking in language skills.
Therefore, the need for language skills is becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career anyone will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this ability that he can enjoy throughout his life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the US in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language quite well so as to have a discussion, while French was the only language that spoke a two-digit percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially languages of the developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be more important to the EU by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Independent schools in Scotland provide with dedication a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever their future.
No one today can deny that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and attractiveness for young people in Scotland.
They have to.
John Edward is director of the School's Independent Council.
Lebron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of the fiddlers who dare to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost ended.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James would play the first game on Sunday before the match against Denver Naguets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said in the Lakers' official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans on the six games programme that the Lakers have to give before the competition period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canali YouTube
President Donald Trab started a series of meetings starting with West Virginia's Wiling.
This is the first of five scheduled concentrations of the Trab next week, which includes periods in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm its choice of the Supreme Court to be in expectation, the Trab seeks to strengthen the people's support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trab's concentration in Wiling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can monitor Trab's concentration in West Virginia online below through live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be mentioned in the hearings of this week for the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kawano, which took place in a silent atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote confirming Georgia that has been put in wait for up to one week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans who face a controversial outcome in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, the outcome of President Trab's campaign stated that these five concentrations next week aim at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the House and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congrass control is so crucial to his agenda that the president travels to as many countries as possible, as we travel in the multischool campaign period," Reuters's campaign representative, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Reuters.
The planned evening meeting at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab visited West Virginia, the state that won a difference of more than 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisei, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for Georgia, who is low in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisei that the president must come and try to give him a push to the traps," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team has the courage to fight by keeping the hopes alive as it rides to Sunday's singles
After three single-sided games, Saturday's squares might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented end of the band is a fully understood sports idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say there's the creek now?
"There were six steps ahead and now there are four in front, so we probably have a little turn," Jordan Spit said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to advance at four points and remain twelve still in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel the "air in their pans" and have a lot to encourage them, like the two Spits and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one broke three degrees out of the four.
The Spit was deadly from tea to the green and gave the example.
The voices of the rounds became more powerful as he continued his round, reaching a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game at 15th was accompanied by similar pantourisms that show his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You have to look inside and worry about your game," Spit said.
That's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more grades than AIDS and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flidwood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but valuable two of Europe has succeeded four at four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
"Molywood" was the only two that didn't hit bogey in the afternoon of Saturday, but also escaped bogey in the morning of Saturday, the afternoon of Friday and the back nine in the morning of Friday.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy viewers, expresses the fact that they are players who should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flidwood or Molinary to seal a possible European victory while the sun runs above Le Golf National.
I prefer both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European dignity remains early.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put their glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and it has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the US team has the balls, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the 10-6 advance on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its fourball and Saturday foursomes with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired twins of Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinari have made two wins at a run-in Tiger Woods and has managed to take the lead in Le Golf National so far at four levels.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to maintain the tread that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the useless American side of the morning fourball, with a series of 3-1.
The U.S. opposed the foursomes more, winning two matches, but they couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight degrees of the 12 single Sunday matches to keep the troupe.
Flitwood is the first European emerging player to win four degrees series, while with Molinari, also known as "Molywood", after a climactic weekend is just the second two that wins four degrees in the four first games in Ryder Cup's history.
Having cut Woods and Patrick Reed into fourball, they united their forces to destroy a tired Woods and the American new-looking Braison DeSambo with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought the two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashlights, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who took a break for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's match for the 2&1 matches of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, gaining the first and third place in the world ranking.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, rainy day south-west of Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas put in the bus for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win on John Ram and Ian Pauler of Spain at the Fourball and returned later to win the Poles and Rory Macilroy 4&3 at the Fourome while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a team was able to discover while losing four degrees in singles, although because it's the triple, Furick enough to achieve an equalizer to keep the troupe.
However, since it was found in the second place for two days, it seems that a reflection on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it's not going to be disarmed alone without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened the sense of dissatisfaction with the United States and that his country is not going to leave its nuclear weapons alone under such conditions.
R. Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had received "significant good will measures" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the withdrawal of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to start our disarmament alone."
While Ri repeated a well-known example of North Korea's resistance to the possibility of a "stationary" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea will be forced as it progresses gradually in the process, its statement was important that it did not completely exclude denuclearisation, as Pinging did in the past.
Ri was mentioned to the public announced by Kim Young Oon and Donald Trab at the first summit held between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "renewal of the Korean landscape", while Trab promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "feel" its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also opposed to the calls for a relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is insisting on "first respiration" and increasing pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal by exaggerating, even putting obstacles to "the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that punishments can be born to us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the U.S. leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the Minister noted three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Mun Je-in the last five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of disarmament was South Korea and not the US, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an outcome".
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. intern with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because the Poor President Trab called Kim "a gunman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trab, who threatened last year to "destruct completely" North Korea, urged Kim to be courageous to move forward with the disarmament measures, but said that there should be still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is detonated.
On Wednesday, Trab said he had no timetable for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should reward Pinging for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and indiscriminately until complete, final and confirmed disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously approved the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralise the financing of Puning's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Piinging again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pioning in July saying he had made progress, to be accused by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea was committed to meeting with Mon this month to decompose a nuclear facility and also a nuclear assembly if the United States received "anti-measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "anti-measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trab promised in Singapore and were promoting the reconciliation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are watching lessons about how to get enough rest
This year, a new study at Harvard University aims to make all successful students sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of the entire study with the consumption of many caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to care for themselves.
Charles Tsaisler, professor of Medical Respiration at Harvard Medical School and a specialist doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, planned the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the study after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why do I know that just now, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to her about the meaning of sleep - something that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The lesson, which began for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barry, professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that the students were falling asleep within the week to an important extent.
The early school includes a series of interactive work.
In one unit there is the image of a student student, where students click on bottlenecks, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performances are affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of inflammation, brain, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the student behavior immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects of health when you choose to smoke," Professor Tyler added.
His culture to appear because you've been studying all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means that sleeping is a problem that is being pushed.
A lot of sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhalation and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep suppression puts the brain in a state of throbbing, resulting in a permanent feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Tsysler to plan the course, having followed one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson all over the university.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all graduate students to follow a similar programme before they start their studies in this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Tsysler urged the students to arrange a notification for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a wake-up alarm, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can decelerate the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga puts a bullet in Gerard's men
The Rangers were still suffering from an outback, as Dolly Menga's south led Stephen Gerard's disoriented side to a 1-0 bed in Livingston.
The Ambrox team wanted to mark its first victory outside the February Trimmonium with the 4-1 in St. Johnstown, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight degrees behind the Charter, which is the first in the ranking of the Ladbrokes Championship.
Manga hit seven minutes before the mid-year, and the inspired Rangers' restaurants seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers is now falling to the sixth position, Livingstone is climbing up to the third, with just one bullet different from the previous Hibernian.
And Rangers can also wait for other trouble, as the next calum Svens needed to get first aid for injury to the head caused by the object that was thrown out of the floor.
Gerald made eight changes to the team's composition and destroyed Eir in the semi-finals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Livi 11" that took a degree from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-fledged machine was able to drown every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have ruled in possession, but Livingstone did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long walk sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep, free suite of Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but his opponent Alan Lithkow's only defense was to send the ball away from the dock.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the last third game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have won a penal in 15', as he fought with Steven Loules, but the prosecutor Stephen Thompson ignored Colombia's insults.
The Rangers had only two suites in the area in the first half of the year, but the ex-terminal of Iprox, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about the head of Lasana Culmbali and the subterranean suite of Ovi Ezaria.
Although Livi was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of his struggle, no one can deny that he was worth the effort and only.
And again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Deklan Gallagher played the ball at Scott Robinson, who maintained his temper and found Manga who just completed the effort.
Gerald made changes in the middle of the year by taking Kulmbali and putting Ryan Kent on, and the change almost immediately, as the extremist beats the ball in Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to lure the guests into the style of the game that she knows and enjoys, with the Lithkou and Halket to remove one far away after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs in the same way, stopping him before Lithkou's attempt from the corner.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Mindton, had another phase for penalty at the end, as he was in conflict with Jacobs, but still Thomson didn't know it.
Almanak: The inventor of the meter Geiger
A page from the German Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day that the future naturalist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radiation, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger meter.
In the 1950s, with Bells of Coronado, with the leading players of the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andrew: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as the sky.
When you wear these hearing aids, you hear the reaction of people caused by radiation to the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, it's like crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues its work.
A new anticarcinoma vaccine teaches the immunosuppressant to "see" the problem cells
A new angina vaccine teaches the immunosuppressant to "see" the problem cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to recognise the problem cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the export of immunosects from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then become their reinjection.
One vaccine under test is expected to produce results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells saw the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of non-foetal cells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a common protein in many cancers, called HER2, and then the reinjection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofsky explained, the HER2 protein "is the engine for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and intestines.
A similar approach to which unscrupulous cells are exported from patients and then "scattered" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West was defeated by Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA strain, after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was awarded a studio during a Saturday Night Live after an off-site interview with US President Donald Trab and said he would apply for the 2020 elections.
After she also presented the third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, where she wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (to make America a big one again), she gave a resurgence against the Republicans and repeated his support to the Trab.
"Sometimes I talk to a white guy and he says, "But how do you like Trab?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch case in which Matt Damon, the star of Hollywood, was competing to frame Bret Kawano's statement before the jury's Judicial Committee on Christine Blazi Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, the video with West's completion was uploaded to the social media by the comical Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to frame West with this resistance.
Also, West protested to the public that he was not well behaved to the scenes because of his hat.
"They made me bowling in the suburbs.
They said, "Don't come out with the hat."
They made me a bowling!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's going on, I'll wear the superman hat, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were accepted at least twice by the public and the SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person declaring in the magazine: "The whole study was a dead end".
West was called a replacement of the last moment of the singer Ariana Grante, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had escaped a few days earlier.
West confused enough when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supported Kantas Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservatory Group, who tweeted: "In one of the most miraculous spirits: IN THE EYGARISM TO BE REFERENT IN THE OCHLO".
However, the showcase, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "his own and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who believes that he is embedded and exhibits ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the one who was previously known as Kanie West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Ddy, also known as Paf Daddy, Pafi and P. Ddy.
The rapper Snoop Doug had changed his name to Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of Music Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
A category of attempted murder to attack a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikamor, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Court of Justice.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticises the toxic arthropodity
Kit Harington is known for the role of John Snow on the violent medieval series of HBO imaginations, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31 years old, condemns the stereotype of masquerade heroes, saying that such roles on the screen pass to the little boys the message that they should be hard to win respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that "what goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic fertility in the time of #MeToo could be combated.
Kit, who recently married his partner at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe so much, where did we make the mistake of being rude?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing the toxic fertility due to the undesirable characteristics promoted.
He continued: "What is implanted and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they should show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
I'm sure something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview it was also admitted that it did not intend to play any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end of battles and horses".
As of November, Kit will be taking the lead in reviving the project True West of Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best he's ever had from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the line, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here and over," she said.
Rose was caught by Aegret, John Snow's fallen in love, the character that Kit is caught in the Emmy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family village of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new crimes were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new crimes were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly to some parts of China due to contaminated blood movements.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the Chinese LOT community.
Homophilia was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination at the expense of the LOT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to HIV drugs in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters predicts that an expert has been intercepting data from the Republican governors, condemning the "hazardous lies" and the "consensual theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters told the allegations that a member of her staff published personal information to three Republican elders on the Wikipedia page of the legislator.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles argued that the claims were promoted by right-wing commentators and websites.
"Flying, lying, and even more terrible lies," Weather told her Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the housing addresses and phone numbers of Lieutenant Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hats of Juta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill's environment during the hearing of the Committee of Georgia on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kawan.
The leak happened some time after the three miners had questioned Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as the Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the reports was linked to the Weather office and published the data of a member of the Waters staff, The Hill reported.
"This absurd claim is a completely false and false lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these false and false claims, was in no way responsible for the flow of such information.
This insurmountable claim is a complete lie."
The Weather statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, among other things by the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Flesser.
"This defamation is full of anger, Flesser wrote.
"This shows he has no duty to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a traitor.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Flesser seemed to compare Weather's reaction to the criticism of the Republicans for Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics of feeling very angry at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to embody Weather in the mid-elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's true," tweeter.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities about these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Movie review Johnny English Again - a subtonic spectrographic film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit's signs in every new film with a British character, and this seems to apply to this revitalization of the comic film française with hero Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Could this humorous self-satisfaction be about how obvious we are to be the new opportunity of the nation's exports?
In any case, the unscrupulous Johnny Ingles with his twisted eyes was able to renew his license to make them a second time. His name states that it is a wider comical creation designed for non-English cinematographic viewers.
This is, of course, the adjam secret agent who, while pretending to have the light and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose from "Lord Bin" and something from the guy who played one and only a note on the music of the movie The Roads of Fire at the start of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveling and international mystery man who once drowned Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten TV advertisements, smacking the gap in his passage.
There are one or two good times in this last film of JE.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in mediocre armor and the elixirs hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, the humor is quite subtle and strange, especially when "serious" cinematic franchise such as the 007 and the Dangerous Mission now contains enough comics.
The humor seems to address children rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny England's crazy rides are not as exciting and relevant as the Athenson's boob-type sketches for Bin's person.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A governor has interfered with the super secret Internet network of British dignitaries, raising the identity of all British agents in the mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, whom Kevin Eldon has been forced to play a very small role for his well-being.
It is the last step for a ambitious and ambitious prime minister who is in the forefront of the collapse because of political hostility: Emma Thomson is doing the best he can with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
The information advisers shall inform it that, since each active viewer has been discovered, it should return to someone who has been trained.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a director at an aristocrat school, but gives an incredible lesson for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as England offers an academies of a kind A High Rock School.
England returns to the Whitehall for urgent information and reunites with Baff's ex-patient partner, whom Ben Miller once again falls in.
Baff is now married to a submarine manager, a crazy role in which Vicki Perddin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Ship for the Secret Service of This Magnificent return to action, meeting the beautiful and partial Ophelia Bulettova that Olga Kirilenko is subject to.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is tempted by the generous billion-million-dollar technology that claims to be able to solve British technology waves: the threatening Jason Volta, whom Jake Lacey is subject to.
England and Baf start their pharsocommodation: transformed as waiters, put fires in a quiet French restaurant, cause chaos as they attempt to cross illegally into the luxury yacht of Volta, and England causes anarchy as it tries to use a device of iconic reality to accommodate the interior of the house of Volta.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as valuable and pheasant as they are, it continues to remember a little child TV.
Half things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he's really going to grow up with his talent?
The workers consider that they are considering a plan to work the British four-days, but to be paid for the fifth.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan to work for the British four days a week, but to be paid for fifth-year work.
The party, according to information, seeks the owners of companies to distribute the savings achieved through the restoration of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources indicate that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the projects of the party in order to return the yoke to the workers.
The four-day change was approved by the Labour Council Congress as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A higher source than the Working Party stated in The Sunday Times: "A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one night, but the four-day work week is a ambition that is directed at the group's approach to re-establishing the economy for workers, as well as the overall strategy of the group on industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its overall pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
Working Party representative said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party."
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to regain power from the "personal directors" and the "devices" in the companies of common benefit.
The plans of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take back their entire share, as a powerful government of the Workers could make "conservations" due to suspected disease.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees in the company's administrative boards and the creation of mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual interest rates of up to 500 pounds in England.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the 60 minutes show about whether the FBI investigation for Cavan could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kawano has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the decisions of the service could affect some Republican officials in order to withdraw their support.
In his interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, who responded to the 60 minutes show, asked Republican journalists John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could erase anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, I do," said Kennedy.
"I said that by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was amethypic, determined, indictable."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I've decided on Brett Kavano and it's going to take some kind of explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Bret rejected it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever has named it can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see it changing anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and famous stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park in the framework of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Son Mentes, but also to be sensitive to the real goal of the event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting against it.
In order to ensure a free ticket to the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, sending an e-mail to a world leader, calling or finding other essential ways to contribute to the awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of the reward with a free assembly the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism", when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and notifications resulting from these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been allocated or concentrated.
The group considers that the funds secured have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and activists, who have taken the commitment "to help children make full use of their capabilities", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate bribery, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of bribery a footnote in history," Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during the live conference in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is directed at 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequently asked questions on the website,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great movements for human rights and against the right before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Son Medte, Cardie B, and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will appear in the annual event in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Li Farnes and Hiu Jackman.
The US can use the Navy War for "exclusion" by preventing Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may turn "if necessary" to its Navy to prevent the availability of Russian energy in the markets, including the Middle East, as the US Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, has discovered, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it is called upon by the legitimate government, is a prophecy for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States is able, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is characterized as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He agreed on Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little bit, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," said a Russian-speaking characterist, "who knows only one trick," as he has a fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made as the Trab administration has taken the mission to strengthen exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the most affordable choice for European consumers.
For this reason, Trab's administration, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" work for the Nord Stream 2 which, according to Trab, will make Berlin a "capable" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a work with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing capacity of the treatments into 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s severe opposition to the project is driven for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novac after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused Germany to react, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Diter Kembf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Valdimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of declaring a candidate for the Presidency in 2020, says Masahushetti's gardener
The lieutenant of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would take seriously the possibility of declaring a candidate for the Presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting in the capital of Holiouk in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that's why a woman at the top needs it," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a presidential candidate."
Warren criticised President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying that "he leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Robb is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't know her words about Trab and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kawano.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said that "of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should put a candidate for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the gardener should not apply, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such an application.
The survey showed more support for a possible candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other popular names from the Democratics who have been discussed in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 are former President Joe Baiden and Lieutenant Bernie Sanders of Bermuda.
Baden said he would have decided officially by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Pilein referred to Trak Pilein's Trak-Pilein's Trak-Pilein's Metallurgy in Donald Trab's Collection
Trak Pelin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his military in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Trauma Stras Disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he told the public in the context of the Donald Trab concentration in Toils of Oklahoma.
Pilein described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, return harder, return queryers if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday at Waisil in Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in relation to domestic violence and armed robbery, while he was in a moderate state, according to Dan Benet, a representative of the police department in Waisil.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the question of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian region support a legal dispute over the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to overcome compromises or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the region submitted a report to friends curiae on Friday in Washington, supporting an applicant asylum to question politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the strike in Greece's trial against Zion, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been revealed in August against the federal policy.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are members of the partnership" had abused her, however, US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing severe problems with reconciliation and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Migration Decision Committee (BIA) and allowed innocent migrants who escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "is not known for all decades of civil, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a curse violates this principle", in the report of friend curiae.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy refusing entry to migrants is damaging the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary labour force".
In June, Judge General Jeff Sesion ordered the immigration courts to no longer grant asylum to victims attempting to escape domestic violence and reconciliation.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or persecution because of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," the Session said in his statement on 11 June on politics.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people are facing every day in the world.
Unknown rescue efforts in Palu, as the number of dead is doubled over the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had a fever, in a decommissioning center that had been placed in the devastated city of Palo.
"Every minute the nurses bring other bodies.
The clean water is pumping."
Some residents have taken the initiative to return to their ruined homes and to collect their existing water, trying to cut down what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to cover the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who had been in the middle and shoulder ward, stayed outside the Prison Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the basement because of the continued strong movements.
The tears poured down his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the walls," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she took a silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "exploiting" with "propagandist propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly newspaper in a daily U.S. newspaper defending the mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trab reported last Wednesday on China Daily's on-payment receipt, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Congress elections on 6 November, a category China rejects.
Trab's claim that Beijing has been involved in the US elections marked what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the climbing campaign that Washington has launched in order to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war and have imposed various duties on imports.
China’s anti-dumping duties at the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Republican Bank, mentioned Chinese and American experts.
Teri Brandt, US Ambassador to China and former government with long-term status in Iowa, a state that is a significant exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing had affected workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, as Brandt wrote in an opinion article in the Queen's Des Moines Register, "is taught in this kind of speech by publishing propaganda on our free press".
"In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing a payment announcement to Des Moines Register," Brandand wrote.
"On the contrary, in the wake of Beijing, you will find minimal disparaging voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans dismiss women voters in the interim elections because of the flag with the Caucasus, the analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Britt Kawan despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a response, especially from women, in the next interim elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," said The Hill Grant River, professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, regarding an article published on Saturday.
Rier questioned that the recent move by Colonel Jeff Fleic (R-Arizona) to request an investigation by the FBI would be sufficient to attract the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November," said Karin Zan-Pier, senior adviser and national press representative of the MoveOn Progressive Group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators regularly called the phrase "November comes!" on the way to Georgia, as the Republicans who control the Court of Justice gave the green light for the candidacy of Kavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, mentioned Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Republicans will reach record levels," said St. Rodnenberg, an unmistakable political analyst, at the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of unresolved female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years who, while opposed to the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford's public statement in which he detailed his complaints of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the money.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about voting on the committee or on the final vote or whether Kaban will be put out. It has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was brought to it," said Gai Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, who assists in the election of the Republicans.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat confused about who to believe after the Fort and Cavan's statements, reading slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or probably believed in Ford's claim, while 35% said they were sure or probably believed in Cavano.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cavan probably or certainly lied to his deposit, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Felix moved, the FBI began investigating Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, mentioned The Guardian.
Last week, Ford put in front of the jury's judicial committee that Cavano attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the applicant for the Supreme Court showed her her births while she was at a party, when both were studying in Gail in the 1980s.
The world's inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burns Lee, the world's inventor, starts a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new point of this technology tradition is Inrupt, a company based on the open-ended Solids platform of Burns Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Bernards Lee ridiculed that the intention behind the Inrupt is the "world domination".
"We need to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic storage space" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of off-the-jobs, journals, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to the information.
The company calls this option "personal support through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's management council, John Bruce, is to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is made up of Burns Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some concerted programmers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said his own team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were allowed to make radical changes, blocking business models in one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a media release released on Saturday, Bernards Li wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the solid platform".
In 1994, Burns Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Bernards Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with the Inrupt, Burners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely resourceful for the next time on the Internet," Bernards Lee added.
Bernard Van: Price tax in office received by the Victorian Army in the A' World War
The only heir of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian Army during World War I as a soldier was honored in the family of 100 years later.
Vice-President Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a free target four days later and never learned that he had disbanded the highest British military discrimination.
On Saturday, the discovery of a memorial plaque by his two grandchildren, accompanied by a passage to the Northamptonshire Rasden.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "excellently symbolic" that the discovery of the plaque was made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vice-Chairman Van led his team to the Canal of St. Kent in a very dense fog, while he was accepting a strong weapon of war and multiballe."
Later, he jumped on the sideline and with "excellent woman" led the line forward before hitting him alone with a weapon of battle three of the wreckage.
Anti-Semitary Van was killed by a German free killer on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get to, it's something that makes you feel unrestricted respect".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a baton after the passage, led by the new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great honor in the passage" and added that "the manhood of a real hero is proved by the support he has of many people."
MMA's followers stayed to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Pope Wurunaki
Consider the following scenario: You have been staying to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you will be delighted to see this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six in the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussie and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, the audiences in the United Kingdom remained in shock when the show changed Peppa to Huronaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had remained awake until the first morning hours especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described the show of the child's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 in the morning, so the child's programme should be planned," said Dave Svarts, Senior Marketing Vice-President and Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Wurunaki, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said they are going to work out the programme to include the United Kingdom leaders in the future.
"If we think of the reefs, I think we can do it," said Koker.
"But it's six in the morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday's own time, i.e. their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged in front and they weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you, next time, it's not going to happen.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer more to the lights and we missed it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "less" because of his sexuality
Olymbionics at the funerals, Tom Daily, said he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, however, that moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he was in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Disks presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the other "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he has been less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presentation of the well-known radio broadcast, was for several months on vacation due to illness.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Dale said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to achieve."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
Twice, the Olympics Halkinis is a prerequisite for the rights of the Latvian community and has taken advantage of its participation in the annual Community Games in Australia in order to call for more countries to proceed with the criminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any impact, and that he wanted to give other "hope".
Three times a world champion said "it was a surprise" when a man was in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daily married Oscar Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older, but he argued that the age difference never existed.
"When you spend so much time in such a small age" (he first joined Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a fellow who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said he changed his whole perspective.
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer in the brain.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether he had taken tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first series.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you wouldn't be near us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he was not incredible," he said.
In the following year, Daily competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the calcareous metal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life, to fight in the Olympic Games in my family, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which infuses him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him to wonder.
Desert Island Disks broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside of Michaelson will sit on the ice on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who attends for 12th time (record number) in the two-year-old competitions, was required by Chief Jim Furick to sit on the stage for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as usual for the United States, five times the winner lost the day to worry about the lines and "work" his game, hoping to correct his problems.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even on the ground of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow area of Le Golf National, where long distances are often problematic.
And as if not the difficulty of the floor, Michaelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open champion, who cooperates with the first appearing Tommy Flidwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, could take the lead with a good start, Mikelson's game may be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he's playing today, hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we thought we should start.
He wants to get out there like everyone else."
Michaelson's going to cross Nick Faldo's record for most of the surreal games at Ryder Cup.
Could be the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 knots and seven halfs, although Furick said his presence benefited the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's a ghost, he likes to make jokes and he's great at the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun bothering him this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The leader of the European Group, Thomas Björn, knows that the great advance can soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great advance that starts from the singles of the last day to Ryder Cup can easily be turned into nothing.
Danos made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama race, where a team with the head of Seve Balesteros managed to take over five degrees against the Americans, but he just managed to cross the finish line with a different breast, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after we were violent," Biorn said, in the picture, following the generation of 2018, to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it all up.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the table.
We have a goal, to win this item, and there we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that there are also good players in the other group – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would not have hesitated to predict the result.
Tomorrow is another animal.
Tomorrow measures individual performance and this is something different.
It's great to be in the field with a fellow when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you try your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind, and he has to give it all up and show himself the best."
Unlike Biorn, Jim Furick from the opposition team will ask his players to note better individual performances than those they had with their associates, except for Jordan Spid and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furick himself has survived both the end of the last day's revolutions, as he belonged to the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected event, as Europe has done its miracle.
"I remember every rhyme of his word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, chief in 1999, had congratulated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medina.
When we get this line, there's a lot of pressure in the middle of the race.
We decide our series accordingly and we play with the series that strikes us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the race and confronts Rory Michaelroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and Ian Paulter, the rest of Europe in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group in this series because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said, justifying his choices for singles.
New reference for Germany's new warship
The new cargo of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the old warships of the post-war era, but it will not be taken up until at least the following year, due to poor systems and the costs incurred, the local funds are mentioned.
The service of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the shipyard of the fully-fledged Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been suspended until the first six months of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which is called a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy War in 2014, but the problems with the tradition were determined for the success of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that ordered the Marine War in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen fleets.
They will bring strong rules, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, overheads and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new brakes for up to two years apart from German ports.
However, continuing delays mean that even if the warships are considered to be the last technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until they finally come into service, they will be already over, says Die Zeit.
The badly-fragged F125 was first-line last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss navigator in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy War returned a ship to a ship after the surrender.
There has not been much information known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a series of significant "problems with software and material" that would put the warship into useless use, if used in a battle mission.
The software's problems were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have about 120 sailors, just half compared to the oldest Bremen class brakes.
It has also been found that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz frigate believes it has the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of all the work (including payment training) was also a matter.
It is said that the amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) was reached in the near future, while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the new brakes are particularly important as Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartz, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy War "will soon have no ship for missions".
The officer said that the problem was raised over time, because the old ships had been docked, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brakes could join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the nights
A new survey carried out in a village in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to discover how nightbreakers use the area when hunting their food.
The results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique species of mammals and will contribute to the design of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of common tanning and microning, as well as dobdenton coffee and myotide in Inverewe Gardens, in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the area to monitor nighttime activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will test the frequency of night calls and what types of behaviour they have.
A biosite map and a report will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a local scale.
Romp Deuar, an environmental environmental consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important to the nightlife and how they are used by all kinds.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of habitats, such as the creation of pastures and the best way to keep forests for the nights and other related species.
Nightlife populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced since the last century.
They are driven by building works and development projects that affect the areas where they root and destroy their habitats.
Non-methods and lighting are also dangerous, as are collective films for flies and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Nights aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect impulses and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 plots of land throughout the country, considers the nights very important.
He has ten trained experts who carry out regular investigations, inspect the places where nighttimes run, and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created the first and only refuge of Scotland for nights only in the village of Treve, in Damfris and Galoway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says the farm is the ideal nightland.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for nights," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There are still many who do not know about the nights, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It points out that it is important to take first control of the existence of nights before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of one and only shelter with small could kill up to 400 women and small, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species and we are forbidden to kill them, to disturb them, or to disrupt their peace, or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferel, author of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer help.
He said, "There is much left to learn about our nights and many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to send a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo described the allegations of violence against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to defend themselves" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to send the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Yuvendus is accused of raping an American named Kathryn Magiorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay her $375.000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video in Instagram at 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball in the camera.
"They want to defend themselves and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but this is part of my job.
I'm happy and all right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to send Der Spiegel for the claims he has published, which have been described as "an acceptable report of reputations that touch private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Kristian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "ethical damage according to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The case is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night’s entertainment center, Ronaldo and Majoorga returned to the player’s room, where she was brought to violence rather than by nature in accordance with documents submitted to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Magiorga claims that Ronaldo fell into the knees after the alleged incident and said he was in "99 percent" a "so-called guy", but betrayed him the other "one percent".
The documents indicate that Ronaldo admitted that they had sexual contact, but that it was consensual.
Magiorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "feared the possible antidotes" and worried about her "public execution".
The 34-year-old says he's trying to reverse the arrangement, as he's still suffering from a metabolic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was eager to receive a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Younget in the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to the Italian Youth by ensuring an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret the loss of cars forever"
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever", if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said the Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernston, where the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota are being built, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will cease at our plant," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Executive Adviser in Bernston.
Other cars in the United Kingdom have also expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks in the supply chain according to the car industry in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. The exchanges arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and a lack of dependence on the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold a stock outside one day at her factory in Derbisseir, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically aimed at resolving the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4 show.
"The data that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how much car would stop production, however, warned that the additional cost would for a long time reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvalari, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is United States trade union officer at the factory, said that members of the body are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
Government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, the White House announces
The important meeting of Donald Trab with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein may "suffer another week", as the fight for the candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kawano, announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Specialist Roger Miller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the Trab's assistant connections with Russia and the possible interference of justice by the president.
The Trab could fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Miller's independence, feeds Washington's bowls for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of putting his talks together with Trab and making it possible to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he transferred to the White House through reports that he was about to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
Trab said he would "preferably" not to disband Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed so as not to coincide with the hearing procedure before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia, in which he placed both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, Trab ordered the FBI to carry out a survey within a week on claims against Cavan, thus delaying the voting by the General Assembly.
Sarah Sanders, a Trab-type representative, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not yet been set a date, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data on all the other cases that the Supreme Court has been dealing with.
But we'll see, I still like to keep the guy informed."
Some journalists objected to this claim: Sanders has to make type information in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the information was not due to the "printing" movements of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown".
He then let it be understood that he would increase or direct communication between Trab and the type.
"The President gives more talks than any previous president," he said, adding without giving any information: "We have looked at these numbers."
They will continue to carry out information, said Sanders, but "if the guy has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is even better than talking to me.
We're trying to apply it often and you've seen that we've been applying it often in the last few weeks and it's going to get the type of information where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trab often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or type interviews with official visitors.
Individual type interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an anti-conventional and somewhat different appearance to concentrated journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System through fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the National School Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish member, sent a letter, leaving less than six months to withdraw the United Kingdom from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent residence ("setled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Fryman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued during the summer and lead to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member of a relative nationality.
Brothers from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Kristian Abercroby undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers Cristion Ambercroby team was subjected to an emergency surgery following a head injury in the Saturday match, where Tennessee State Tigers were recruited with a score 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the journalist of Tennessee, Mike Organ.
The chief coach at Tennessee State Rod Red told reporters that the injury happened just before the mid-year.
"He came to the ice and just fell down there," Rid said.
The nurses and medical personnel gave Abercrobic oxygen to the bag and then put it on a truck and transferred it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nashville of Tennessee that Abercroby was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "not yet data on the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercroby, a second-year student under limited participation regime ("redshirt"), spends his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total taklins on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the 18 total taklins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher end of paper for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher ceiling for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, in line with the new projects in the United Kingdom.
The measure will neutralise the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to provide assistance to the actors
Foreign buyers will start to have a higher end of the paper for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to provide assistance to the stars, as Teresa Maye will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to deter the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with commitments to provide more economic housing and to target high salaries.
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the shortage of roofs.
The increase, which is due to the current end of the paper, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the sale of second houses and rented houses, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for buyers to enter the first-house real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "municipal cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the end of the paper, so that more new people can get their first residence.
He told the large construction companies that they kept the prices of the properties high, but that they would use it and call on Mrs May to destroy the platforms in economic housing in order to restore Britain's "construction".
Mr Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed construction reforms, which include rental checks and the ban on "without justification".
He also wants to give more authority to the councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said, "Percy said I would dedicate my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
This involves the adjustment of the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies with a home abroad to buy homes as easily as hard as British employees.
For many people, the dream of home ownership has become more distant and the lack of shelter is still valid."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train the Scottish team"
Santerland's leader, Jack Ross, says his "excellent ambition" is to become a coach at some point of the national team in Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch is excited with the challenge of raising the group of northeastern England, which is currently in the third place in the English Football Category (League One), three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stage of Light in summer, after he had previously referred St. Myren to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team, and that was," Ross told the Scottish BBC on the radio show Sportsound.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland's team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I have success in training groups."
Among the predecessors of Ross in Santerland is Dick Advokaat, David Moyas, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poyette and Paolo De Kanio.
Aloa Athletic's former coach said he didn't feel thirsty when he was called to place such established names on such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnabas and Ipsuit Taun.
"At this moment, the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "can I return this group to Prime Minister Ligg?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it belongs indisputably to Prime Minister Lig," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach in Dubarton and a period of 15 months in the training staff of Harts.
He then helped Aloa to return from the submission to the third category and led St. Myren from the bribe of the submission to the championship in the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Cardpool, Folkerk, St.
"It was probably a real crossroads," said the reminder of taking over the position of Aloa's coach.
"I really thought it was more likely to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was going well, I was getting valuable money out of it, and I got pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to take a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the anxiety and pressure of the job, but my coach's job fits completely.
I've always wanted to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've been feeling with myself all my life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to research
The summer fuel increased the profits for the British pilots, but brought greater pressure on the chain restaurants.
The pubs and bars saw an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA's advisory company, who gathered the data, said: "The continued dizziness and greater than England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, where the profits of the pope increased by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the revenues of the restaurants in June simply affected July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures of the restaurants.
The pubs serving food also presented sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to get out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM's recreation and hospitality analysis department, said: "These results confirm the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of the important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in sales on the outside of the domestic market.
It is not surprising that the group of restaurants continue to be difficult, but the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly difficult data of the continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the focus area and time would show if the lowest temperatures that we have experienced in August would give us a vast extension."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in commercial name launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over 9 million pounds and is the established industry reference point.
One of the five children keeps secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents
As research reveals, one in five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
Research in 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages in Instagram
This news raised fears that sexual content is involved.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - even 11 years of age - create social media accounts that are kept hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - this is a reference to the Instagram photo reporting website.
This news raised fears that sexual content is involved.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who urged others to rush her (“fight me”).
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Biukanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create Internet sites where their parents and teachers cannot identify them."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Foundation Council
Elind Doyle was elected as a non-executive adviser to the Scottish Foundation Council at the annual General Assembly of the Director.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning sports player, and President Ian Biti has announced her election as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilind enjoys unrelenting respect for the entire Scottish, British and global pillar community, and we are sure that the foundation in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry to the council," Bity said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, having acquired a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular contributor to BBC, remained paralyzed after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will show me how much I'm going to get.
It was crazy, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing adventure exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement of a midwife comparing mothers to cows gives the internet a common opinion
A breeding company has issued an online common opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers who are breast-feeding with cows who are responsible for them.
In order to launch the so-called "first-time wireless and portable TV", the consumer technology company Elvie released a film advertising inspired by video clip to indicate the freedom offered to pregnant mothers by the new TV.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of cows full like, with a song that includes sticks like, "Yes, I care about myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't nuns, they're my tits."
The song goes on: "Take it, take it, feed it baby, take it, take it, take it, take my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has brought online opposition.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take the "freak" of the dairy industry seriously.
"A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth" someone said.
Elvie's gymnasium places discriminating in a breast-fed (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "It's obviously harmful to both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a barn for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended the advertisement, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "disciplined".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a teapot if I was still teasing.
My breath made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising is a bit of a mess, but I didn't want to overstate it.
It's a smart product." Someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who burn mother milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like "golds".
It is not an advertisement that affects the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that everyone danced with the discriminating chairs lying in their backyards.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who burn breast milk with a calf say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie gym is completely indigestible, it has no cables or pipes, and it puts discreetly in a bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even get out during the dive.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Creation at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Tilator is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all the challenges it has, while showing the incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new barn.
It's not the first time Elvie has become a first cell.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the hairdresser for the fashion designer Martha Yakumboski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been immeasurably moved to a settlement on the coast of Texas
The number of migrant children in detention has risen, although the monthly border releases have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trab administration have made it more difficult to match children with supporters.
Traditionally, most conservatives are also migrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to come out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was raised in June, when the federal authorities announced that, by virtue of the conservatives and other older members of their household, they should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior servant of the Travel and Customs Service, told Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who were asked to keep unaccompanied children.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had a white criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of those who are either conservatives or members of the household of the conservators are illegal in the country and most of these are foreign criminals.
We therefore continue to search for these people," Mr Albens said.
In order to speed up the execution of children's cases, responsible persons introduced new rules that some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applicable, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear through an iconoteleviscion, in the position of the self-representation, in order to develop their claims for a legal regime before the competent court on immigration matters.
Those who consider that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be removed immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or tired, which may lead to violent explosions or withdrawal attempts, according to workers in refugee camps and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
The co-workers said that these concerns are intensified in larger facilities such as Turnigio, where the indications that a child is in difficulty are more likely not to be understood due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving the children to the scene without giving enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the injury they are already fighting with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "powers of possession" to withdraw immediately
In response to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Weilid al Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth century.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, in the context of the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They must be removed immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Mualem added that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "give this sacred war until we persecute all the Syrian terrorists" and from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-damaged country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mulem said that the conditions are good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "dispersal of absurd fears" that forced refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Police a question that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be granted for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is reached.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a detachmented zone in the last major wave of rebels in Indlib created an opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian agreement allowed an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would target giants, among them and warriors from the Al-Qaeda-Metopo Nusra connection, who would "be disarmed".
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to the formation of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moulem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "in the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Because Trab will win a second term
In this sense, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the motion for a resolution and the scandals soon end his presidency.
Something beyond doubt would be "The most dramatic stage of the presidency of all ages!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-television area have been overcompensated, reaching 1.05 million in the CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million TV players in the high TV area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast has cut TV numbers on satellite TV, with 3.5 million TVs on important news evenings.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, a producer of the drama series ABC "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a veteran comic series screenwriter and book writer entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said he would vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked why?
"He answered "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scowell told me.
You can even have fun with the mess.
Of course, unlike the television series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against Wade, if the immigrant families can also reunite the world economy.
The frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
But you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you're six hours away to watch a team of specialists discuss the use of "multiple interviews at the scene" by Bob Woodward for the book "Fear" ("Fobos"), Paul Manaford's bomber jacket of $15,000, "a full suit", according to Washington Post, and the consequences of the glamorous descriptions by St. Daniels about Mr. Robb's anatomy.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and gives you the feeling of reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars TV program, about the constantly changing actors and the daily turnings in the plot of the Trab show (starts fighting with N.F.L., blames Kim Young Own).
You don't have the power to lose any incident, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius out of his house on the north coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in looking at MSNBC while he was looking at CNN.
He could not escape, not when Brett Kavano was about to appear before the Committee on Jurisdiction and the future of the Supreme Court was hung by a locker.
"I remember doing those crazy shows in the past and the people said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western culture," Mr. Flis told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

External money contributes to the more limited re-measurement for intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional Region of Pennsylvania accepts a flow of money, thanks to the reintroduction of Congress's electoral regions, which has put two action members of Congress candidate for the same position.
This recently repatriated pre-accession region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections held earlier this morning.
Lamb has another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is very much associated with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were reviewed following a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which in January found that the former regions were being handled in an anti-substantial manner for the benefit of the Republicans.
The electoral remeasurement in the new 17th electoral region has led to a financial competition campaign between the major financial units of the parties, the Commission of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DCCC) and the Committee of the National Republic of the Congo (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a final victory in a special electoral remeasurement that took place in March, for the 18th Pennsylvania election region in Congress, which was followed by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region by 20 degrees.
Political analysts are making a slight progress on the part of the Republicans.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for his support in China, but they turned back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the partners dismissed the Agency Trab's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to revoke US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "new decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", as Heather Nauert, a representative of the service type said earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received approximately US$ 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passports, would be effective for the country of Central America, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings were taking place, North and Central American officials set up a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a result of a respective concentration that took place last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from crossing the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward to the conference, giving a substantial end to the thoughts of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, indicating the importance of the concentration of administration, as the diplomats said.
And the three Americans sent back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative on behalf of Mr Balton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke on the subject of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by the Special Council of Robert Miller on the subjugation of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is estimated that Mr Miller is also turning his research into possible co-operation between Mr Trab's pre-election campaign and Russia on the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trab will find a record before this body, as he is prepared to re-elect the Presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before the court.
The 'yes' is a lot and I do not assume that Mr Trab's fall, or his pledges in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officials were ready to take action against Hitler, if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We managed and lost the chance to avoid the years of killings that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of struggle and the insurmountable path of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans now come face to face with enough of these battle points.
What would we do if Mr. Trab fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who held on to Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that last time he proposed to be secretly recorded by the president and that he considered it inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said the issue adopted by the Times was reprehensible.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation into Brett Cavano is not complete or fair or is assigned to the Supreme Court despite the basic charges for sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress to put Mr Trab's account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took in the Act, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that he had ever taken to my embassy.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later sent me to set up Jewish Saturday's candles at that table with the swastika.
With this heritage, how can I not be ambitious for our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is an iceberg for the battle with Rapid Vinnis
The Rangers accepts Repid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive spacecraft in Spain with the Viareal earlier this month, will give her a lot of opportunities to take advantage of the 7th European League Group.
A knee injury prevented the medium Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the balance of score 2-2 with Vijareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a tool for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vigarel is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We won the game believing that we could achieve something and we got to a point.
We might be able to escape at the end, but, in general, equality was a rather fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we were better at the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well in fact, we can take three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results to their last game, but, with the world on the floor, I'm sure we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and the changes that happened to the group itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good, and the kids are enjoying it, training is good.
Let us hope that we will be able to put our strengths now, leave behind our last season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were discussing with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about this to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they are not taking the initiative to discuss this issue," said Holly Snyder, Chairman of the Nationalwide Safety Enterprise.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advice: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a cost to help you cover these costs or safety with your own property - enough to have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make an expert on health care issues so that you can identify a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, collect the possibility to make an expert on your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters on your part and ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become invalid.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an exceptional health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please refer these details to a written plan to be ready.

Andras accepted multiple guns with a gun in Ilfracob
A man took a lot of guns with a gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, who was about 40 years old, was located in the area of Oxford Groov of Ilfracob in the county of Devon, when he received gunshots in his chest, chest and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place at 02:30, British Tyrian Time, as "a coincidence."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Insects and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to rise.
With the communications to be stopped, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, an area in the north of Palo, which is closer to the center of the 7.5 degree earthquake of the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were removed after the destruction.
The following are some important information about Palo and Dongala, in the island of Sulawezi:
Palo is the capital of the province of central Sulawezi, located at the end of a narrow valley on the west coast of the island of Sulawezi, with estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an anti-Kingdom extending over more than 300 km (180 miles) of octopus in the southwestern part of the island of Sulawezi.
The anti-Kingdom, a level of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main support for the economy of the province of central Sulawezi and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawezi.
Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indian Disaster Management Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the semi-seasonal Fire Firefly in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indian Ocean Coast in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while over half of them were in the Atlantic.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of May and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of dead people on the island of Nya, near the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8 degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck the southern part of Java, the largest island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.

Sarah Pilein's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pilein, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the presidency, Sarah Pilein, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Peylin, from the Alaskan Waisil, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, an obstacle to domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report the crimes she had committed, she grabbed her phone from her hands.
Pilein is temporarily held at the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "sure, innocent" when he was asked, as the network says.
Pilein faces charges for three Class A floods, which means he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
It is also classified as a category A flood, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time he's been prosecuted against Pilein.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pilein.
His mother, Sarah Pilein, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, an obstacle to the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of weapons, while he was in a moderate state.
His partner claimed that she was buried in the face.
Sarah Pilein was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she associated her son's violent behavior with a transformational anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismus and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake of the Richter scale caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been stopped, while the number of dead is expected to rise the following days.
The earthquake struck close to central Sulawezi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, video is released from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a party on the beach in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors ask the Spanish-based death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty in Saiful Saipoff, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that cost eight people their lives - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30 years old, is brought to use a rental truck from the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on a road along the West Side bus in the Lower Manhatan, landing passengers and riders on his road on October 31st.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with intent" and caused serious physical harm "with intent", according to a statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed in the Court of the South New York Region.
Both of these categories are subject to the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal body of jury brought Saipov against the 22nd category, which included eight counts of homicides against a criminal organization, a regular practice often applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a category of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov ended the attack as "atrophobic, hard and hateful."
"Saifulo Hamboulaevic Saipoff caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, En-Laur Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferutsi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alhandor Damian Panuko", as mentioned in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the last time the New York South District Court held a case for the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to equal treatment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the spouses Julius and Etell Rosenberg, who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Shaipoff, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared to be inseparable in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was inspired to complete the ISIS video attack that he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for an ISIS signal to his hospital room, according to the police.
He declared innocent of the 22 categories listed in the complaint.
David Patton, one of the federal public co-workers representing Saipoff, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty rather than the acceptance of the declaration of intent for equal treatment with no possibility of being saved will simply prolong the injury caused by the events for all those involved," Paton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Mr Toris said that NATZEL FARATZ should be the head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraz was sworn to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest gathering at the Thores conference.
The former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians should be "inflicted" by the Eurospectists, as one of Teresa May's Members said that he should be the head of the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bowe told demonstrators in Bermigham that the United Kingdom would "have already come out" so far if Mr Faraz was the responsible minister for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile her deep-rooted Members was underlined by the fact that EU-toris supporters participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit rebels, EU and EU survivors.
The allies continued to move forward with their efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions, and to require the Europeans and the Labourers to choose between its package and the "meat".
Mr. Bowen said at the left Means Leave (Decision means Deviation) protest meeting in Solichal that he wanted to fly the "Chekers" project.
He said that he should have been given the title of courtesy to Mr Faraz and that he had been given powers for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were chief, we'd have already left," he said.
The Weilingboro MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we need to throw out the Chekers project."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the claims that the common opinion had been changed since the 2016 vote: "The statement that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay is completely out of the question."
Brexit's supporter, Mr Andrea Jenkins, was also present at the event and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers project has no acceptance of the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, does not accept our party and our activists who come down to the streets and under us choose.
Please leave the checkers project and start listening."
With a strong message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said in the concentration of protests that politicians should be required to "feel pressure" if they are prepared to issue the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of confidence among us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you let her off if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are killing the people of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never be satisfied until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU's supporters protested in Bermigham before they had a double concentration in the city centre.
A few activists threw out the Toris against Brexit after the group's meeting this weekend.
The Minister of Labour, Mr Adonis, struck the Conservatives on the grounds of security issues they faced with a party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technology needed for the EU-type agreement – Canada with wealth, for the unforeseeable borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute flag.
It doesn't mean good Brexit" added.
Warren is planning to take seriously the possibility of applying for the Presidency.
U.S. Secretary-General Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider applying for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the governor of the Republics from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during the concentration in a capital of Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trab, re-elected in November, against the Republican representative of Jeff Dill, who represented the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly claimed that it can be remeasured by the 1990s.
The event in the afternoon of Saturday was its 36th meeting with voters, using the structures of the capital since Trab’s reign began.
A representative asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, and that means that a woman must be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of the LSU Weid Sims helicopter on Friday.
Baton Rose's police department announced Deton Simpson's arrest, 20 years old, in a type interview at 11μm (Anatholic Zone).
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot deadly near the University of Southern University site early on Friday.
"Widd Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade invested to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was discovered and admitted that he was at the point with the gun in his possession and confessed that he shot Wade Sims.
Samson was arrested without protest and held in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rose Congregation.
The third year student Sims at 1.98, who grew up in Baton Rose, played in 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a main player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ribaudt per race.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his group's instructions gave him the victory on Sebastian Fedel
It became clear from the time Valterie Botas passed before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the fight.
In the wake, Booth had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position on the first two laps and called on Fedel to attack his stand.
Fedel went first to the pit and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one round after and went back from Fedel, but Hamilton came out after a wheeled battle, which forced Ferrari's driver to accidentally abandon the internal because of the risk of infraction of the double move to defend the third angle.
Max Fersteven started his last post and was seventh at the end of his first round of 21th birthdays.
Then he left first for a large part of the race, as he held his beams, aiming to end quickly and pass over to Kimmy Ryconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits at 44th round, but he could not increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Riken came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Walter was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team went very well and made one-two," Hamilton said.
The language of the body was very bad
President Donald Trab ceded Lieutenant Diane Feinstein to a meeting on Saturday to insist that he did not interrupt the letter of Christine Blazi Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the submission submitted by Ford before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia, commenting on the fact that those in the House proved that people are "students and fools and liars."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Church, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and cruel and foolish and liars," he said.
"When you see ads and leaks and then they tell you, "I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you broke the document - "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, a minute.
If we broke... no, we didn't break," added the mayor.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kavan in July and it broke earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the break was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't go through her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in Hill's newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her secret and keep her secret as he asked."
But her refusal did not seem to be particularly convincing to the president, who said during the meeting on Saturday: "I will tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
He may not have done so, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's motion, which was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the President let it be understood that the Republicans use the charges to serve their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by using any necessary means.
You see corruption, sport, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk to get power and control," the president said according to Mediaite news website.
Elit Lig: Danny Storrs 5-3 Belfast Jiands
Patrick Duyer put two bullets for the Jades in front of Danny.
Danny Storrs took a stand for her fate in the Friday match at Elit Lig from Belfast Yellows, winning the 5-3 revan on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy two-goal run with Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauny brought the plains to the ground before Doier retraced the Giants' show.
Francis Bousar's bailed on Danny and then two bullets from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third time in Elit Lig in the season for the men of Adam Kiff, who came winning 2-1 at Dandy in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two groups, with the Giants having won the previous three matches.
Dweier opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kental McFol's assistant, while David Rutherford gave the essay for which Pubieger doubled the lecture four minutes later.
In a period of plenty of action, Sullivan put the field team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the help for the esophagus from Caini at 15:16.
Doier made sure that the Giants were successful in the first half of the year when his second ball was made for the night at the end of the first period.
The group of the peasants was reassembled and Busar re-assessed with a display of power at 27:37.
Cauni and Charles Corcoran joined their forces to help Nilsen make the move to Dandi for the first time in the fight at the end of the second period and he secured the victory with his fifth team goal in the last period.
The Giants, who are now lost in four of their last five games, are playing in their seats with Milton Cains in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to free hundreds of aircraft passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, losing his life in his attempt to secure the safe departure of a plane that transferred hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were ignored because of a great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong migrations continue to affect the region, and many have been trapped in riots in the city of Palo.
But even though his colleagues wanted to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunauan Aungung refused to leave his position at the checkpoint he was running at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then on the take-off route, could be safely landed.
Then he jumped off the checkpoint when he thought it was gone.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohanas Sirett, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as it broadcast the ABC News TV network.
We set up a helicopter from Balikapán to California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to Palo the helicopter.
"We're obsessed with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster management service says that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of the dead is expected to rise again, as many bodies are still under siege, and many of these we have not managed to achieve," said the Service's type representative, South-Purvos-Nugrogho.
The waves that reached the six meters destroyed the Palu, which will complete a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riza Kuzouma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
The clean water is low.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jean-Gelfant, president of the International Red Star in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Star is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What has happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesia's President Joco Weidondo arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out any work related to decommissioning.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lopock, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of a ship at sea
The airline that carried out a flight associated with a Pacific sea in Micronesia now reports that a man is being ignored, while earlier it said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a type card said that since the afternoon of Saturday it is not able to find the signs of a man a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to identify the man.
The air carrier did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships of the region were helped to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as he was trying to land at the island of Tsuk Airport.
The authorities told Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were stationed at the hospital on Saturday and the situation was stable for all of them.
The causes of the conflict and the precise compatibility of the events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was pushed into the seaport outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought that the plane crossed the landing route.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as a means to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the airports had panicked and called, and he himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy War reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a sailboat also helped to rescue by using a flashboard to transport people to the coast before sinking the ship to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these conflicts.
The analyst sets out the schedule of the night when a woman died alive
The accused authority completed her purchase on Saturday at a man's repeated trial accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Roulette set up for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile files to line up the moves of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulette said she received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, disclosing his previous claims, as stated in Clarion Ledger's newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was together with Chamber's cell phone the time it claimed he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford sat down as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the defendant started asking him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He chose to lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another argument was that Teleis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Mobile files showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulette said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Telis wrote the messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wrote it out of his life," Heil said.
The defence will begin its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he considered that later that day the trial would be brought to the jury's judgment.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?

They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip hops popular again.
Artists like Fugees and the Commons are experiencing a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
Danta in New York sends a couple who released her after receiving a "racist" message
A New York dat she conducts a couple for a racist resolution after receiving a message that she was mistakenly sent by her mother where the last one complained that the dat was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, like treatment with "exemption".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new D.A.J. Morris was black, just the last one showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her coat, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman now released Mrs. Morris, saying that their missing daughter, who was from Africa, had done no good work and waited in her position for a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a salary for her one and only day of work and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has done a deal against the couple seeking compensation for the dissolution and is making compensation for the $350 class on the day for working as an internal detachment, for which she had initially been accepted, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's a discriminating treatment."
The couple objected to the claims that they were racist, saying it was reasonable to dismiss Morris, for they feared that they could not trust her again after being attacked.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Like treatment with "exemption", Plasco said his wife had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you be chasing someone who's in this situation?
It's not that kind" the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the court of the common opinion has decided to condemn the couple in the social media, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Pantington were afraid that readers would not be interested in a man speaking, as a new letter reveals.
Bod's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a little after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the great success of Paddington."
She said her father, who worked as a librarian at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book from a Lutheran bear, was illogical for his work, adding that the 60th edition of the book was "glucopic", as her father left his life last year.
Regarding Pantington, which he describes as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't a superhero," he said.
"But because Pantington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who can do something: you're proud of it even if it's not your own ability to do it.
I think that's how he somehow saw the success of Paddington.
Although it was a creation of his own and his imagination, he always gave the credit to the Pandington himself."
My daughter died and I had to tell her goodbye to the phone.
After the arrival, her daughter was transferred to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called all the time and told me it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope to do it," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometimes Nand called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tasi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were gradually decreasing and they were getting out of her organization.
He was already dead a few hours ago and that time and now they're all gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing it was all that happened.
I couldn't scream, shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperuz, who so far believes in her daughter's shame, was on the plane with the other passengers, who were unaware of the test she was going through.
"No one knew it" he said.
"I had my head down and they were bleeding all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, I got a feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who spend the loss of their own people hang cards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys are hanging on a bridge in Wales with emotional messages and phone numbers that can be called to support.
Her son, Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef, with a translucent smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died, as he was in a very bad situation.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm pretty worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Hamfreis, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt broken or tired or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
He had fallen asleep on the day of Christmas - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look in the eyes."
He said that his death caused them a huge trauma, but they had to overcome it: "Dissolve the family.
It's bothering us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Fleic on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved through troubled partial loopholes.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the time continuance.
The interim elections are only in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as is expected, the Republicans do not do so well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person who wishes to be elected in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bus calls to the Governors, urging them to support Mr. Kawano, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bus and through him met his wife Asley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavano can take at least 50 votes in the Bureau, which would enable Mike Pens, the Vice-President, to take the majority and ensure his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels falls under Kim's authority
The number of residents from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Young Won was given authority seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, adding data from the South Korean integration ministry, said 1,127 distances were reported last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest charges on mobile persons were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made public comments.
In the overwhelming majority of residents from North Korea, the Republic of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the largest borders with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavy-protected Destructed Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees rather than refugees and often relieves them of violence.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is typically still in war, has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Piñang to discuss the negotiations on disarmament, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young Oon in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate with their own terms for the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Reim Jong Il, accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country solely first," said Mr. Reim in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy calls Brett Kavano "sister", says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The Democratic President of the Council of Representatives Nancy Pelozy called on the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kawano "outer" and said he was in self-conformity unfit to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelozy made these comments at a conference on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be called "sister"," Pelozi said about the Kawan's deposit before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia on Thursday.
Kawano, with intense motivation, refused the charges that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his extensive purchase, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost cried, and his voice was heard as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democratics on the committee, characterizing the charges against him as "a country-wide and coordinated political murder", organised by liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy said he believed that the Kavano's case proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was pre-democratic against the Republicans.
"I think that he himself has excluded himself by these statements and by the way he has achieved himself against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi responded when asked if he would try to protest against the Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and if the Republicans were to receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is currently serving," Pelozy said.
Kawano is a judge at the District Court of Appeals District of Colombia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi added that as a Republican, he was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano regarding the Law on the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kabano failed to answer questions whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Isn't it time to go to court an austere, pre-specified man and wait for us to say "it's not great?" said Pelozy.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified blow, months and years of anger are gone and can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry" Mrs. Stanem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "It helped me a lot, a woman who was an expert somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and began to cry, he said to the person he was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And it seemed great to me."
The tears are allowed as a burst of anger in part because they are basically wrong.
One of my deepest memories of a job I had done in the past, in a office where men ruled, is once I cried with sudden anger and he grabbed me from the neck a larger woman -- a cold manager I was always afraid of -- and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're fired.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they broke it to you."
Patricia Srder, then Democratic Gjoller from Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Chart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken to have an extra-marriage relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Bromodulia) and left the battle attenuated, Mr. Srder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidateship.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow and the Seven Rivers."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and so it was sworn that it would not enter the race of elections if it had not collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave it only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
In her speech in which she announced that it would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than for representatives and angry with sexism - who felt bitter about her neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," remembers Mrs. Srender about the guy's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my partner's donor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my carpet?
"Sweet down"?
How trade war between the US and China can do good in Beijing
The welcoming ammo of the US-China trade war was expansive and while the war has much to finish, a gap between the two countries can benefit for Beijing for a long time, experts say.
American President Donald Trab issued the first warning drop earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, with the imposition of new tariffs on US$ 200 million ($150 million) in the form of half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns fires to species every time, and recently it has imposed a rate of five to ten percent on goods worth 60 million dollars.
China is determined to respond to American fires and the second largest economy in the world is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington withdraw, he must submit to their demands, but public speaking in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, China's president.
But, according to experts, if Beijing could play its cards correctly, American pressures in the context of the trade war could have been positive for China for a long time with the reduction of interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers in the past have allowed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher with a study centre in Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a thinking tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugee return and calls for help to rebuild the seven-year-old (and now) war of the country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Weilid al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All conditions are now met for the urgent return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and biodiversity.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Mualem said that the aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, it pointed out that it would not accept aid under conditions or aid from countries that supported the enlargement.
Europe locks victory at the Cycling Rider in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Cup Rinder, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in the Gulf of Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The U.S. team has now been engaged 6 consecutive times in European territory and has been winning the Riyadh Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the lead, as Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The star of the U.S. Phil Michelston team, who fought hard at the longest time of the tournament, threw it into the water at the par-3 16th hole, granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player of Golf Molinari missed all around him, so it became 1 of the 4 players who won 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was shot at 5&4 by the lowest player in the European team, Dano Thorbyorn Olsen.
The best-ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Powder from England, who can play his last game at Cupallo Ranger.
The Spanish Veteran Eight Cycling Ranger, Sergio Garcia, was the most successful European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5 degrees.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the doll back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said excited after the European victory.
It gives the dog to John Ram's companion, who won the U.S. Gulf of Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible surprises that I won Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire this guy," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and now he has a career record at the Rider 13-21-3 Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and has only overrun Jack Nikolaus.
The U.S. team found it difficult all weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments this morning, we pushed Europe quite hard.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will be re-engaged, working with the US PGA and the Cypello Ryder Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to accept it.
They were better than us."
