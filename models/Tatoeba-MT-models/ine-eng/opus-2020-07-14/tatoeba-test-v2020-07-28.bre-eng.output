I want to be a coward.
You're going to school.
Are you kidding me?
Are you there?
They're in a lot of trouble.
I'm staying here.
I've seen a squirrel in the zoo.
It's a thousand years old.
Do you want to go ahead?
Look, it's a bee tree.
You want to drink this thing, Tom.
I'm pretty good.
And because he was thirsty.
It was like a girl.
Are you all right?
I don't need any kind.
I've lost my heart.
I haven't forgotten.
Where are you going, Galleg?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
You're welcome!
You knew Tom well.
The list is up to date.
Are you here?
She was a slow girl.
It's dark.
My book is on your desk.
Tell me what you want to get.
It's in private.
I didn't know Tom was Mary's mouth.
You!
Look, it's an apricot tree.
The letter has not been written yet.
Whether to play a sound to notify of incoming messages.
The verse is gone.
I'm glad I'm here.
It can't be.
This is not a phrase.
Tell me what you want to get.
Can I have a little bar for you to wait for?
Lous and walnuts.
Is he white?
You got a car?
A thousand friends.
You don't want to go to your dad's house.
Good-bye.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Tom was talking.
Do you have a car?
Thank you.
I've lost my client.
It's a fruity fruit.
What's your address?
Who took all the cookies?
Don't wait.
Do you like the black guy?
There was an error.
Don't talk to me!
Naf, it's so cool.
He was the first guy.
They don't bite.
You're so careful.
He's been shot like a woman.
Is there a head in there?
Watch out!
It's going to be all right.
I don't care.
Don't leave me alone.
I'm not.
I've been robbed of money on every side.
An external language study has been completed.
Tom and I don't want any more baths.
He preached to Tom.
You've got a check from under the table.
He owes us one.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the sixth day of the week.
Are you jealous?
I can't leave myself alone.
Give me the whole, please.
More coffee, please.
He was the first guy.
Thank you!
People were on Sundays.
I'll find out.
Tom's gone into his neighborhood with a nice friend.
Naf, it's so cool.
Me, I don't need anything.
At night!
Look, a Japanese apricot plant!
I understand.
Shut up.
I know what you're hearing.
Thank you.
Please respond.
I swear to God, Tom.
It's Tom.
I've seen this before.
Khalifa is the world's highest skyscraper today.
Are you out of here?
I don't expect it.
Do I have the whole thing?
I have a bad watch.
Tom was crying.
You don't have to get one.
Worked to make me one.
Send the doorman with you.
Where is the room?
Did Tom give it to me?
I'm sick of it.
It's a gift to Wagdalena.
This car's mine.
I'll be right there.
The many are on the table.
Look, it's an asteroid.
Gallege is out of range.
Tom wants this thing.
They're still dead.
I want to talk to Getter Jaani.
That's great. He's gonna die of his father.
Bennozh, Yukina.
It's not a joke.
There's a lot of horses in Brazil.
It's black.
Tell me about him.
They sang a song.
Here we go.
Disgusting.
Thank you!
He's not white.
Look, there's a tree here.
He wasn't in the house.
It's all right.
Opened the north end of the car area
You can't stand here.
I need another one.
It's in Tokyo.
You don't want Tom to be a treasurer like his father.
I got it.
You've lost it again.
I've seen Tom go.
He was a great man.
A string that I have configured.
I like it.
Tom's gonna call the cops and he'll have to call him.
It's just the circus.
People are going home.
I'll keep going.
A guitar I'd like to get.

You're a Guarizius?
Watch out!
I'm sure I've done something like this all the time.
Look at a red tape.
I'm fine.
Sunglasses make me look more like them when I'm painting.
Tom is the only one who knows what really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, it's an accidental tree.
Did you get it?
I'm going to go ahead and have a good time.
Are you there?
Is that what I'm talking about?
A strong gel is waiting.
I live in Japan.
I'm not indisposed.
Naf!
When were you born?
Tom's playing Rugby.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
I'll stay.
It's not my turn, it's my turn if it's white.
Look, it's a pink season.
How long is this clock?
It's white.
I'm hungry.
I've got questions to ask you yet.
The enemy has things in common.
It wasn't my fault.
It's late.
I saw him running.
That's great.
Tom wasn't interested in the contact between Mary and John.
I understand you're welcome.
He's a Christian.
The queen's work is going to be one.
I love her.
It's Tom Rugby.
Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom's on his way to get the people to do things for him.
Tom wins.
Tom's got a lot of work to do.
Debrit the bar!
I'm better off.
I gotta go.
Who's that?
Thank you.
White only, please.
There's been a fight under the table.
It wasn't the size of this thing, was it?
Is that it?
Nice to meet you.
Tom's saffron.
Think about it.
Tell me about him.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I'm done.
This film was nice to Dom and Vari both.
I don't speak Spanish.
I'm done with it, please give it to me.
Put it inside me.
Do you drink chicken?
Yeah.
It's time to talk.
One of them is like a sub-people stick.
There's a hole in her head.
I have to finish my appointments
Did something wrong happen?
What are you guys doing?
I'm staying here.
Can you get AIDS against privacy issues?
I want something.
Where's the problem?
My legs are gone.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
You got the money?
I'm not gonna do that.
They're not listening.
I heard you.
Tom's gone?
Only one language is available.
Did you ever go to Paris?
Tell me what you want.
All right, let's go. Let's go.
I've got a little something.
Call the police.
I don't think so.
Just games.
Tom didn't believe Mary when he told her she was pregnant with him.
I've lost my mind.
Tom hated to understand any names in the world.
I don't speak Japanese.
Listen to me.
I know I'm thirsty.
Gallege is out of range.
Where's Galleg's talk?
Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn't mean it is one
He's got one.
That's what I'm thinking.
You're never gonna lie to me.
Thanks, Yukina.
How dare you?
It was last time.
Ask for Paris.
I've come to fight.
You better not go.
There was an error.
I've lost my mind.
Thank you, my brother.
Where'd you like to go to Galleg?
He came with me!
Are you sure?
I heard he's going out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, it's so cool.
One beer, please!
You've got everything.
Who's in here?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, it's an axiom.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a kid.
The art is the bar.
I don't care.
I'll see you later.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm trying to spread English.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
That's not a big mistake.
That's not a big mistake.
I'm not working.
Oh, my God.
I know you're good with Tom.
Have you ever been to Paris?
I didn't take any pills.
One of them is working.
NaF, what?
I haven't heard.
Are you kidding me?
Does it cost you a piece of meat?
I'm not in the mood.
Thank you!
I didn't take any strings.
I'll find out.
Did you see a big link?
Tom is not a student. He's one of the scientists.
I'm not gonna go home any more, and I'm gonna go ahead.
Look, it's an adenium.
That's it.
Look, a piece of information.
Is this clock fixed?
Be soft and have a good quality at least - you're going to have a lot of fun.
Can I have some coffee?
I've got a scratch on me.
That's right.
Some of them were like lunatics.
Where's Gallege talking?
The money sounds like a language that's known every time.
The enemy's doing things right.
Stay home.
I'd like to take care of you.
I'm better off without a fork.
I came along.
Naf, it's cool.
Tom's taking care of it.
That's not a phrase.
Damn it!
The car's blue.
He's got a song.
Look, it's a real idea.
Thank you!
That's great.
I'm not waiting.
She's reading it.
There's two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was such a guy.
You're getting your head in the hole.
There's no reason to be spontaneous.
How about Tom?
I remember this thing.
He's gone.
There's still a cup of coffee, please.
I'm just getting along with them.
Yeah.
No, thank you.
And Tom did?
Tell me what you want.
I'm sure you don't want to talk to me.
There's something I've seen.
This sentence is not valid.
The car's blue.
One's going to work.
"What time is it?" "It's half an hour."
It didn't work out.
It was Tom's rescue.
I don't know.
I need another one.
How dare you?
It's gonna be late.
He was a terrible guy.
Aonic is Tom.
How much is this score?
I'd like to have a cup of tea.
Do you like waste?
Where's it going?
There's a lot of gold.
I don't know.
We need your friends.
Who owes all the cookies?
He was a cop.
Go to the good school.
Khalifa is the world's tallest screenwriter.
Tom's gone.
Enclasses on-me.
Rugby's playing Tom.
I know you won't be called.
That's great.
It's busy today.
He was a black man.
It's too far away.
I thought Tom was dead.
Tom gave it to me?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Thank you!
I'll turn what I want!
It's Pauur-du.
It's okay.
Look, it's a different tree.
I'm trying to find you.
