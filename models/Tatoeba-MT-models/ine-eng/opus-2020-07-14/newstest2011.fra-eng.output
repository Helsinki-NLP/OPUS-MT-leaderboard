What's going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital's headquarters will appear to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, i.e. whether they knew the argument that was born in the last years in May, when they were the partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political crème set in motion during the previous era of Major Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new electors do not understand well the known terms.
At least they're telling him.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a junior in Prague's politics, and Lucas Kaucky, who was elected to the culture to test the vocabulary of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of golf holes.
"It's the only expression you're proposing me to use."
Otherwise, I don't use the money.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the words in June of this year before the pre-Eectoral Congress of the ODS, the editorial chose 6 examples, in priority those that are related to the mayor of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry", "beauuf nef", "trahison of the capital" and "tolerate".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first of all an interview but then did not decouple the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't care about any of these things and how the representatives of civil democracy get used to it: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we are going to understand our programmes," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elite Lukas Kaucky would obviously not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and added immediately: "But I know the papers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental elite, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
The two social-democratics know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the pastry".
"This is, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to conclude that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same point, your Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge out of newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of argument in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have anything like this."
"The names are sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Socialist Party, as members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues are calling me like that, I admit Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
Elu Weinert is Papy for the party members, or much less friendly Little old, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the polls during the party's sponsoring, is named "the little game".
Surnames are also the only ones allowed to employ social-democratics within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Law of Matrak" reminds him that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title as Doctor in Law JUDr.at the Police Academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "sorcers", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who are reported to be sorceress have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, for example, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and they have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcière" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has that destiny."
"We no longer judge young women in good health because they participate in work and host children," says a sister who is in charge of the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of over 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help to limit the hunting of snakes.
The case has a "hec."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," said the daily Die Standard about the inconvenientness of written education.
The charge of sorceress is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor to Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman was killed after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil they had sprinkled on her.
It's the BBC server who sent this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual onions was inflammable to the woman's contact.
The oil burned, it seemed, when the team wanted to "feel the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of the "sorceres" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The eating of human spirits has always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunting to the storks, Gambia no later than last year even saw the President take part in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt for the sorceries who, he seems, would have participated in his death and would be forced by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"From the bells of Guinea near the rescue, they brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, of men and women selected at random from the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, the prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion of hallucinogenic effects that added to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bacal's tenant: The chickens are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the door of the client centre of the RPG Byty company from the "carbon bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his son, his daughter, and his son, who is going to be cleaning up a penalty.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on the solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the authority to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explained to him in anger and half-rejected.
The Citizen Association of Apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new conditions of rental as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One word of this, another word of another word" by breaking the lights.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already starts to light on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to resolve common problems such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments are receiving mail with the new lease contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers 15 to 38 percent rent increases.
the special guesthouse for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on the test" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the geek when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Degradation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and the originator of the Region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of Social Democrats has made this statement sufficiently supported before the elections and is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floorer."
"They didn't even change me a little...in a plank in the toilets, eased in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, these are mainly, according to employees, retirements that come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they now sign as promised by the RPG in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" of the Havirovaska Street is not really covered by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said.
And yet, RPG puts up both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will take the decision.
'It is not a threat but only to inform about the only and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to court here" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the client center gives him reason.
"I have 13000 pension crowns and I have 5000 crowns to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
The rental regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to the RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"In addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is just the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest with rents in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen widened to the ceiling in front of the recovered faucets from the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and does not cover less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And this will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase in 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The mother school is part of, too, offices included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also opens a mother's mini school with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a mini-game field on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees may be present.
Arch. Design. The Architectonic Project Society, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first construction of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of having children, and it is important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. within its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to work with child care.
These are Arch.Design employees who have imagined this motherly school and with the support of the management they have been able to obtain a European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mother's school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to funding (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment, and after two years to provide qualified staff as well as road transport.
After using funding (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mother's mini school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year, and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the request for funding.
Childcare is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a maternal teacher are taking care of children. Children can go to the maternal school without a limitation of age but they have more than three encouragements most.
As it is a "mini mother school", there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but more than one can be replaced during the day.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini-school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of schools to English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a delay in looking for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program enhances the marketing of HRs.
The ossuary house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the ladder to a vertebral column of dinosaurs and the balconies to open fish guillas.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of House in Os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaics, a façade recalling the scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is fun for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house runs its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, the geometry, the rhythm and the order are carefully considered.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of color brightness is reinforced.
The rounding and torsion of forms also appears within the interior with the same measure.
The wood can be used to copy the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelids and the blades.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a multi-dwelling house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that decorations are born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators also worked for the façade.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo household plans began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises named the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in Os".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with aviation events and typical roads.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi did not fully comply with the construction directives at that time and was not allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained the city's permission to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the building were imposing on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Joseph Battlo demanded (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and the third room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is divided by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi is also working on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be connected fully by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or be limited to the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new façades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior court is decorated and with the light wells.
The two-colour game gives maximum light in all the floors of the house.
It was simply enough to be based on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by each.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment available to the public.
Owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found that it was a profitable business and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and to the granier, including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket in the monument is really not expensive and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is, however, above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a pillow: women have other criteria than men.
Not an ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so mats and sommere provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement themselves harmoniously to please a particular user.
During the selection several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress is to be placed and the pillow is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the countryside house where latex mattresses are not constantly smoked is not suitable because they "heat" gently.
They have, in addition, a weight higher than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilating channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The person who spends the time abroad where you often use very thick mattresses with a wobbly layer will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep down there."
"For their weary shoulders, their feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a wobbly layer of lean mussel."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore mistakes "information" of joints and skin," explains Silva Adamczykova, who specializes in refurbished furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with the paresian mouse conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex, but also the tropico Czech also have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a hairy mouse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing exerts pressure on you and you won't be back in the night like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
It also serves as a protection against scissors.
For the selection of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed in two places should be 90 cm or in all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120 to 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded ribs. Helena Prokopova, president of the Association of Matreliers-Mathelassiers and decorators who has been devoted for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own pillow and mattresses, so be careful, however, when choosing the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only be left to climb the top to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The wet mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses of at least 15 cm, which is for the shape and aeration layer of at least three centimeters.
"To touch or sit on the mattress you must not feel the resources," says Heléna Prokopova.
Each matelles asks for a well-defined type of hat.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The mattresses were very bad; we don't have to wash it, which is what's really happening today.
And since during the night it is usually sweating from 0.2 to 0.75 l, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and silent) takis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or a life guarantee.
But all of it.
And for this, an experience board on the part of the sellers: for a 120/140cm mat, give up, for the mating of the mats, to the hygiene or washing, but instead add a protective mat that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make clothes with a closed glycerium for the whole, that is to say after the opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a pillow?
Never!
Maximum for one guest bed for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no one) with air holes and use the spring mats with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position blades with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coco nuts) are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Apart from the rigidity adjustment of the blades, what is called a shoulder blade can also be installed.
This is a special bond of the blades that makes it possible to push or tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integre" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already considered by the mathel manufacturers who for the "masculins" began to use a shrinking area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer there are sominas with wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure decreases in more points and reduces tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and air-flaked) on good mattresses and sommeer, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earpiece: the ear must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavias by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the ear should be leveled (with the shoulder blade or the rammoli area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first on the basis of straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or many mixtures.
The trend is also at the biomathelas.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use just the soybean.
"The bio qualification for mats means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petro vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for carpet coverings; one of the first was the aloe vra.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes from the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of bubble plants so that the matal coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "frozen" the man, the clothes "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for low sex.
Current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold mussels (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold flies gives polyzone mats that know exactly where the head, back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economizing for mattresses and sommere is not easy.
It is possible to have two mattresses for a single price for special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers in time.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory mouse worn on the cover for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of paresian or viscoelastic mice with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic rhythm".
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were under the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur bends to the heat and warms, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscolastic flies are used not only for mattresses but also for products for health, such as special cushions for feet that soften the legs and the neighbouring system.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver fly or the same type.
People's tracking devices are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their children leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of Little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of alumettes but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka stirred up a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to interfere with their private lives.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spin-off but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I assume there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know to what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
"And even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought the parents to long waiting," says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also search for them because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be in advance on the police," says the psychologist.
She confesses as well as such devices can help during an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both cars and for people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an aggression.
"The device may be set in such a way as to be in regular emissions after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The most expensive devices also have a tiltimeter that immediately signals the position of the person who slides and finds himself in a position lengthened without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, portable smartphones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formed it with a special proological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to that which is carried depending on the size of an alumina box or the smallest telephones.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will report it after some time, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it can tour the Czech Republic with it, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of wires used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought it 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of cordials is two to four years' maximum.
The army has purchased detonating wires to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general state has given as a reason for the enormous amount of wires that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNAS has contacted, it appears that even general officers with a command, secretary or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating wires.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could survive for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, there are more than 2 m of detonating wires, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured - including the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the rapid intervention brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their ping weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to money needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us such a large amount of detonating wires."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we as traders strive to content," says the business director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating cordial cords will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group states, however, only four years of life of detonating cords and police and military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are stored perfectly in the warehouses, it may even go up to four years," says a two who do not want his name to be published having regard to the military's criticism.
The last lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cord.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than the provision of the last year of 245 km," says the Pejsek spokesperson who interprets the opinion of the Department of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the second world war or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police are still only ordering the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexiblely the types of more modern and more reliable detonating cables.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition coming from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, head of the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNAS has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of detonating old ropes that it buys today "in the good market".
So far, I'm taking advantage of the contacts I've gained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual contractor's competition.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun wants to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building from 5 apartments to half of the house.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt for foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts into pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his business activity has allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberia, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it became another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of Pytloun hotels," number 1 of the entrepreneurs of last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory at the contest of the contractor of the year served well, added Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me, and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not otherwise obtain.
"With those I met thanks to the competition, I began to maintain trade relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and the pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us.
"Only my name is moved forward," said Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The defeat of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a toolshop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crowns business firm.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged me and my collaborators and increased our confidence in itself to fight competition,' the winner of last year's competition said today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long ago, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some friends in the vicinity of his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began specializing in the plant oil press.
He became the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was even known in the unspecialized audience after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to know the Farm brand really better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen to Farmet only during the conquest.
The evaluation of the company had been carried out on the basis of the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"We have obviously not failed in this situation."
"The business figures have fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even license," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society needs to know that over time, unpopular measures need to be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained the benefits even if they were less than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without a commitment to investing in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the resources, strengthened the presentation of the company in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
All of us think the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is up and up with them too.
"A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that deletes any of the rules insinuated.
The investigation into the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The rather glorious winner of this year's absurdity survey was the obligation to bring documents that officials can obtain online in the offices.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted in favour.
For example, social affairs administrations asked for a paper extract from the trade register while the official could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract of the trade register for insurance payments checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even more popularity.
If 3,000 votes in favour last year, at least 4,000 votes this year.
And it is not surprising that there are in our country the most different legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax statements at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of enterprise activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place for business conditions, 8 more than last year.
The year's absurdity competition was first introduced in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can state the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April each year at the end of September, the last time before the conclusion of the competition.
To report, the website www.firmoroku.cz. Next, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during the month of October on the website www.firmoroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is one hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional associations and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, is the obligation for motor vehicles to pay the wages, or even for entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which began in early November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a campaign that regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic, attended the final date of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts octopus in the legs of entrepreneurs, and for this reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today make the company complicated," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to eliminate absurd decisions is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the individual company office at the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a péerinage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Company Act.
The second most pronounced obligation in 2007, which was to declare service travel to a foreign employee in 30 days at the Office, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decision for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year, and the obligation to have a refrigerant has been removed.
A new category rewards those who are socially responsible.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects have been evaluated.
This year's new feature of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair undertaking.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impact of their business and lead a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with only one long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the object of their business is different from each other's activities of support and forecasting can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the entire Czech Republic, there is no example of the Prague and Netera proological society that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the training fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In the case of employees with health problems, the old Podbrad paper factory that employs more than 70 per cent of them can be cited as the company responsible for the central Bohème region and which has been a third in the region at the Vodaphone-organized firm's competition.
In Olomouc, it's MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won to have introduced flexible and even reduced working hours up to 35 hours a week on average and, without, proportionally, reduced wages.
The jury also owes it the title because it buys the Czech manufacturers priority, supports ditoyan activity in the vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the responsible IT Company Log in to the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow who helps the local Roma community," said Andrej Suchy the representative of society.
In the latter, there is also a clean-up and clean-up company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Building Society Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and had sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the high-ranking companies had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the Vodaphone Company."
"The independent registrations are not possible because they are a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organization agency.
In the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested these last days.
The detectives passed the maneuvers to the local contractor and traded by real estate Lubos. G.
It had endeavoured to manipulate just a call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for reimbursement in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a certain candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. about half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are continuing a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Pravto, the head of the Plzen Parquet Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
The police sent this 46-year-old contractor free after 24 hours.
In order to know how he could influence a public competition, we can only speculate about so little official information.
On a question from Prado, the spokesperson of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police had actually arrested Plzen at a separate place of work during the public competition.
"He was a client and in no case an employee, he specified it.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its true name "Call for rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is established when several beneficiaries of the law manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resuscitation that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the proposed rights of the buyers, a classification is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information regarding the persons who were registered in the appeal and, as it is, also a person to benefit from it, since he had purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the contest.
And he was no doubt falling apart.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpolation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards in FdT (Earth Foundations).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been issued.
Only Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she could put the construction at risk by a blockage of land.
Households will pay an extra of a hundred crowns a month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
So from January to January, families will have to take up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, the gas of almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be cheaper.
Increases in electricity should be seen for households in the apartment with 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat it and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns per month, the Liberian families will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change the price, an additional 6.8 per cent will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rent prices will rise significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments starting in January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be translated into courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children thrive on the rhum and the fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and acts mildly.
Fernet, rhum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are healthy, who are not yet 15 years old, among the hands of the doctor.
Children who are hospitalized for relapse do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to hospital children's admissions.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong,' says Prado Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a papal bottle in the closet, it's some time of whiskey, but it's iron and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the Motol hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"It is alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slavovive that they returned from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of the Pélikan Department, seeing children from thirteen to fourteen years of age to hospital admission is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years just in a pediatrician where the ambulances were bringing students from the wide areas to complete winters.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She began her 12-year career when she was taken with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in the blood with an increasing mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice's Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their tolerance outside the community that their rejection of alcohol is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
Experts say, however, that children are not strictly dependent on them.
"On the vocabulary we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that it is not found in children."
"In the case of those who use repetitive alcohol, it is rather a significantly disadvantaged socio-family background," explained the Head of the Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty children of Ivre were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the paediatric clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into the statistics only in cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization.
Iron children who are after emergency care returned to them by their parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pélikan insists on three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the sorceries, St. Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They're drinking after bad results, or they're celebrating the start of vacations."
"Of course, I lived on the day of the nuns a single admission of 7 children of Ivres," Pélikan stressed.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned to him and suffered the next day of the "wood mouth".
The headaches in the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrients needed by the body.
"They're better lotus because they spend an excellent evening and then a soft wake and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at the place where they are," says Pélikan, adding that from time to time this robs the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much they spent and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not deal with the cases of children of HIV.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, landed for Séville in Spain on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is located.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become someone else's property than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad in exercise or demonstration flights.
These are two-place versions of the L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining latter devices are L-159 monospace versions.
They are stationed for the moment at Aero Vodocody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence Press Department, the physical departure of Vodocody's planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single seats planned for the exchange have been taken on long-sealed aircraft without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 Biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He stated that the army would not remain without a bi-place since the department signed an agreement with Aero Vodocody in May 2009 for the transformation of four L-159 single-places unused into two-placed crowns.
The army received delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
Pējsek EADS has undertaken to introduce the aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the person taking into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will serve the training of NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the case of the person taking into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was completed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the trade ensures future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army has purchased 72 devices in Aero Vodocody and uses only 24, which will sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft is likely to have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annuary is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the yearbook are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, in particular by combining with the genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the yearbook.
For them, as for 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the risk cancellation, however, 33 per cent fell, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length report of the two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it was just testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of this study but that he did not seem to feel that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of the compact snow, the sailors have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th km towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 auroute in Brno towards Prague is the same.
The driver of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told the information
In the 91st kilometre a truck was hit, in the 93th two heavy weights were hit, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars have also been found in the pit.
The problems are also on the motorway D1 to 185 kilometers in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km in Kyvalka.
A number of several kilometres of cars have been formed in this area.
Also on the D11 motorway, there's an accident, and that's just when we arrived in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created in Prosek for example, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take from the delay, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the major state of the Prague crisis has yet to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to delete 7 fast connections due to snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroon have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling, but by rerouting surveillance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno it begins to have snowflakes in it and on the road of Blanco the chains are required to pass certain communication routes in the higher places.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far, the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for the moment when they're rolling.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the ascent of inert products, there is also a layer of 5 centimeters of warned snow CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and ten centimeters of snow; it fell most in Bohemia of the north, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
The investigation was progressively fired in Chechnya.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only under the name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly blasting explosive actually works as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target, but also at any point in their ballistic route.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a pit.
It is no longer protected from high and when it falls from a deadly rain of steel cracks, it can also put it out of control.
According to Richard Audiette, who took part in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use the "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the detention.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the detention, the weapon is loaded and pulled at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 localized jobs
The Fujitsu Group locates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, which is currently at the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on the Lyoner Straße street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, the group should group 100 other jobs still in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just renting.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a major location for us with remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is just of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new displacement of an important business within the region caused the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith concerning the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees with the city and its implementation is an important milestone for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our assistance to this company," Mr Korwisi said.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "vertical little" as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. It provoked many criticisms, not only because of the impressive construction of the surfaces that once served as part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has a lot more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name reminds us of its star plan, includes the seat of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Menaces v. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled its servers from the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hidden from political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with increasing force.
The cyber-activists group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a hostel in Europe.
During this time, the leading American senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is probably living in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes your Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said cyber-activists on Wednesday (local time) on the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, cyber-business, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would take this step earlier in the light of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse to use the servers through the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous way. In doing so, it endangers our national security and endangers life throughout the world," according to an independent senator's communiqué.
"No company is aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information provided by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the prosecutions committed against it by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hraftsson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hraftsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the perpetrators of the revelations made by Wikileaks be pursued and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief Executive Adviser, Mr. Stephen Harper, said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the American President, Barack Obama, has described the "religion and absurdity" that Mr. Assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and has recently announced that he is engaged in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now fully passes to the test bank to protect its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Control Centre, was appointed to be responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" which are essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration is exchanging and protecting the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glass
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from around the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
Ice cream and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the ice supplier is somewhat out of date, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated glass with a spatula, has it in the guff and then starts selling it.
For information, we do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbitants founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Practical sessions are also organized in private glaciers.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk achieving their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is proud of the Low Food movement. He wants to propose a European product of quality in the country of industrial glass in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a consultant in business management and she wants, after a few years, to take out some of the particulars of this work that she is trying for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal features of the perfect ice.
It is crucial not only to good knowledge, but also to the susceptibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cerise on the neck of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees with an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it is then a pasteurised white cream, based on all kinds of ice creams in milk.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
The person who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers in spite of this: most often a natural product, for example from the flour of the curry grain obtained from the curry hareicot.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not shake anything but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients purchased in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
It is in the recipe of sorbates to the fruits with sugar and fresh fruits.
It is in the ice cream made from the white base mass, which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added to cocoa powder, is the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them in time to manufacture four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and nosette with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice on the nose does not necessarily contain the taste of the nose, when it consists in much of the nose.
The very popular Kiwi ice is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly meets the taste of a ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of the ice is a calculation exercise: if you use the fishing powder with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is required for citron ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the grapes are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires physical intervention, as in the past.
This is not only the automatic machine manufacturing of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which at the same time the mixture of ice is used to make it intrusive and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, small panels are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo barbows off the fruits of his head at the feet and thus smashes his study friends when the control of the colossal blender ball escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an Ambient Position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the culture of genetically modified plants has failed the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well-informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked in a decisive way to develop the test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed are textually consistent with the Ilsi pressure group positions and thus bear the brand of the industry, which would, in the end, be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking manager of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss syngenta agri-food group without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed the camp.
There has been little time, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) has revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's authority responsible for control and industrial lobbying, which has raised both the suspicions of the German Federal Environment Agency and European MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on the Efsa account are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body is regarded as a neutral forum bringing together experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize caused by the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about a defendant.
This is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why researchers still exist who are not related to companies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell has been looking for it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's station with her back tube.
There was a manif.
He denied it.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: several thousand people have protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the completion of the construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquilizer) in Crailsheim, a tender paddle and thicket built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfieldern.
A few pieces have been searched for.
"These stones are remnants."
"They don't have to disappear."
He exclaimed with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting her off at the school, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do about this piece.
The rocks have time.
Olli Gsell, too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolishment that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were framed or disappeared in the discharge," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reported that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he has negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to resist the demolishment.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project followed by one of the parallels of stone weighing an average of 80 kilograms whose value is between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to do so during a reconstruction.
Rongen had got 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of it is still stuck in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscapers, Particuliers.
They came from all over and took everything they could get into the safe and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limits of grass-bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"it was this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, turning his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did some law studies that he left, and later he began studying biology before he eventually became a career in computer science.
And a stone lover.
The stock of 40,000 tons.
He loved to treasure himself everywhere in Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's cooling up.
Sculptured sandstones with art are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's taking the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a bag of fingers: Red sand Pierre, previously part of Karlsruhe Station.
And so on.
"He likes travertine."
The paralleleliped was already part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of stones and stories, the crossroads of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Holy Cathedral Blasien, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were already carved by hand and moved with the help of simple palans and the carrets drawn by cattle, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He did not become rich, even less demanding.
But this career now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, sculptor, forgeron, glass blower and gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," the waste recycling said.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
Down there, there are stones to save.
Fighting talent to win the highest potential
The counter knows a living flow.
16 students go shopping for small bread in the salmon, tomato sauce and white-meal.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen Auto Constructor invited design students and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they must talk about the future car with the VW designers, and, passing through, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to destroy better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiforme cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the weakest diplomats as far as possible in the amphitheatres before they reach the employment market and are shortlisted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group builds the talents.
A young lady of staff service shares styles, bonuses and cards with Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the timetable of professional courses and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's seat.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project committed to Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can meet the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who go online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's happening again is the offensive we're trying to attract students.
"At the same time, the emphasis was placed on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more acute.
In the sector, companies can no longer recruit their employees by making a three on a candidate's Kyrielle.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, cut the hand of highly skilled work.
These are mainly the graduates from the engineering branches who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the DDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will be further widened.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for KPMG account, audit firm, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes costly events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of rolling-paper where competitors must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person involved shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will be covered for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to seek higher potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little of a thing"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
In addition to the direct adjustment in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises perform in a classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they are hunting for the brain.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, in the solar technology room," says Ms. Sita Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, producing photovoltaic panels.
This company is located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of relevance.
Currently, 35 posts are awarded on the company's website.
"At this point, it is very difficult to have vacant posts."
"That costs a lot and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his final study project at our home."
Honest advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by exercising other qualities: personalized environment, plate hierarchy and easy communication.
"Sometimes a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and their context, while respecting the conditions of the staff framework.
The head of staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this placement will increase the image of society with employers.
"I think that candidates are particularly committed to external evaluations with respect to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When we treat his employees well and they identify with the company, they only make their employer's publicity to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like we were playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drillings
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, a state of the South-East of the United States, over the years to come.
The Washington Government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even beyond the Atlantic coast, new forage remains for the forbidden moment.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform, which is the origin of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident, which cost 11 employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, who was under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the implementation of new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The participants in this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who carries the responsibility of the devastating black tide in the Gulf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with claims for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must present its conclusions on December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice from the hole decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following that decision, different oil groups had submitted applications for new drilling projects immediately.
With more stringent controls and more stringent security controls, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discriminated against after many corruption charges, is currently subject to profound reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches from the gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO before the ban on drilling made on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it extracts a smell similar to that in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't push," launch the environmentalist militant to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil powder in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man buried in the water hole up to the chest, as well as the fat train surrounding him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water gap at the colour of the arch-in-the-seal.
We can't see that the subsoil has brown crude oil nappes.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells that, as a result, she collected crevettes by entire lakes here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil had jailli of an oil pipeline having exploded in the vast seams.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to climb for six hours to reach fishy waters: The country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the damage jumps into the eyes when the mangrove seas are flown through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat has a brown creding water. Whoever slams his hand in it removes any oil cover.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground as a baton of clay. The isolated palm trees allow their palm trees to hang sadly.
We are looking in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually meet in the wetlands: When the outboard engine stops, a fantastic silence falls on this paradise of times that resembles a service station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield inhabited for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to stop its production activities in this region because they became very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the country of Ogoni is still prohibited for this company: while over 2 million black barrels are pumped daily through more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the country of Ogoni are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters are built in the water of steel trays as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are often referred to as Christmas trees.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are wounded by corrosion to the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature falls from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have grown over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that has flowed into the sea during the "Exxon Valdez" super-petroleum accident 21 years ago beyond Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphonation of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner appealed to the Shell Group to apply safety standards to Nigeria mainly less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failure of conduct is "even higher than once".
Some shapes emerge from mangroves to a place that, in view of the distance, looks like a abandoned workshop, full of camburets and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with camburets to the neck.
A sparkly fire under one of the many tunnels that are both connected to the pipes, so that they are spread out on the site for no reason must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence penetrates into a container passing through tubes, then, at the end of the process of the kerosene drops fall and finally gets from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300 liters of diesel per day: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of Delta take part in the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producer country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illicit refiners can sell at a price less expensive than the ridiculously low Euro 40 cents per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who place the oil pipeline network across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion's share in tanks and brandy on the world market.
The Akpobari militant considers that the debate on the question of whether environmental disaster should be attributed or not subversive to the population or the mode of laxistic production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no flight and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relations mainly with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to get rid of it" announces the robust oil worker.
" Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of arrest, but at least they will be offered pot-vins.
Even soldiers from the northern part of the country are intended to benefit, like all Nigerians, from the raw material.
"In any case, this trick has caused our low country to fall," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "accidental failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to bring complaints against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quanta had apparently had more chance: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious safety problem, and it warned against a possible failure of construction.
This potential defect could lead to serious consequences: It may cause fatigue and leaks at the level of the connection of the oil pipeline, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
The reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped 20 aircraft from the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quanta, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now committed judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
The Director of Quanta, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts have been removed and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that is the origin of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, the ASTB spokesperson, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the air carrier Quanta had immobilized the entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, by a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the largest line plane in the world.
Snowfall in the whole territory causes chaos in transport
Germany is covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grotto: By ice temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
The traffic is very limited on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff have been working on a permanent basis, but they have not been able to come to an end of the snow that had not ceased to accumulate.
In addition, violent rapists swept the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau responsible for maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) is expected to meet the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow lovers on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That's why the bad weather alert center Metomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cold winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt country, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused an interruption of traffic and caused noise.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thurige and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the railways, the trees fallen on the railways, the canteens or the damaged needles.
In Saxe, interregional transport was to be interrupted by Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Salfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
The firefighters and paramedics had to provide the 165 passengers from the train in blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The Snow Chutes led to many cancellations of flight in the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport password indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
On the night of Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was pushed to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a noise on a slippery shoe in Ashharenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: the snow will be always soft and dusty, but it will turbulence in the case of light tails.
But the wind is going to get worse.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for his twin tours.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could report up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just removed the seat of the group: The twin tours located in the Business Quarter have been modernised; pending, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
In the meantime, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the cost of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" quoted as a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We verify whether it is more interesting to take care of our own buildings or sell them, and to reinstate them later."
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired a total turnover of 272 million euros from own funds holders, and they were then rehabilitated.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, taken about EUR 200 million.
Of course, a sale reported a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, which were rebaptized in the meantime "Green Tours", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for minors who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The safety situation of the sinister well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been trained underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the minors had no longer had a chance to survive.
Until the bodies couldn't be repaired.
Today, parents and friends have organized a memorial celebration.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun blowing in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors, 29 tables on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen were installed.
Personal photos and effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also in place.
The flags were placed on the ground in front of all the public buildings of the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative festival that New Zealand had provided the hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was enlisted in the sheds, said that he could not refuse to accept the death of his son until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative festival.
South African and British minors also celebrated the first explosion of November 19th.
The rescuers began to fire inside the coal mine on the island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the mass of explosive gases is moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to decline.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splater film an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Wallala Rising", the age of the fighter.
To what public did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well think of the "Wallala Rising" tour?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his burreau and, with a nearly supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators seeking a bloodthirsty action, just because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is ill humour, he pulls the guts of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bourgeois does not say a word on his real name. Even the other characters escape, at the very least, in the midst of one or two phrases of some exuberant agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The Winding Refn manufacturer is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding the drug dealer furouche and full of style, as a kind of quantin Tarantinon danish, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and trial.
Most art movie sympathizers have to test the horror of the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
The action film lovers die naked, when the village boards, for reasons that one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and noise before the crew arrives in America and keeps silent.
It is not surprising then that "Wallalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of the misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a dazzling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is an ambiance, a festive dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glamorous images and a lugrous sound band, but especially with unsatisfiable hatred that cheers the heart of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who is faithfully standing next to the village, preserves some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the bourgeois hero whose furniture is never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally ally by turning himself into a warrior, may be sent from the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but it may also be, nothing but for those who are, in any way, able.
"Wallala Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, which for the purpose of greed, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mystical work of the terrace
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I hunting aircraft attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair As-Sur.
Its name is contained in the IAEA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria built appears with the help of North Korea in parallel helicopter stone, dissimulated in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a United States briefing of information services, the CIA, dated at the end of April 2008, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of nuclear weapons, known as the locality El Kibar.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing faint satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put in service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have only more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is growing.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor to el Kibar, but had little evidence showing that this country had "an active nuclear weapon programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumable reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "flexible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about the way he has dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a conconaic answer in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "adequate documents to ask questions".
The Syrians had certainly hurriedly removed the demise of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical landing of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in El Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received images of commercial suppliers' satellites from a Member State showing the moment that the attack has taken place, and it appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
This is why it is impossible for the IAEA to establish its authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret nuclear programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas maintains that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles by qualifying as impregnable.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El Kibar site and to refuse access to the decompositions of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel maintains its silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never make any comments on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been taking place for a long time since June 2008 without a result and "becoming increasingly a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna recognizes, finally, a serious breach of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that need to have "a functional report" with the supposed reactor.
To date, inspectors have neither indicated which facilities are here, nor what their function or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, respectively, as well as the name of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex close to Masyaf that would probably be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrian people refuse to have the inspection team actually sent spies on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by American secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the paralleleliped stone in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production".
There would be no "no indication of sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to non-rich uranium.
However, there are strict plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where should uranium come from and where would later be separated the plutonium necessary for the production of the bomb.
It is ignored whether the engravings, which could hide valuable traces, have been stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined the al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By reviewing recently photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken land-based work on the three suspicious sites and moved from huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
This may be a coincidence, but this has not helped to eliminate suspicions.
It says in the diplomatic environments that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan on the inspections to be carried out, which should enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the investment time shows the great interest of the inspectors in this matter.
During this time, Damascus also put an end to this proposal.
One year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, for example, says Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been calling for a few months on behalf of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still reluctant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation of a escalation.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought, "Would it be useful if they finally found nothing?"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie started in the summer as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that a Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian bourreau during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the rotation sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of war-victims addressed Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and asked her to meet the actress. Jolie herself is an ambassador of the goodwill of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they decided on this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no stories of love in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a long time about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to remove the quality of good will ambassadorship in Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its script, has, after a few hesitations, granted a rotational authorization to Sarajevo, but we do not know why it has not then come.
The young author himself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has been aware of the Yugoslavian conflict, and that she supports her desire to exert the terrible consequences of the war and to enable all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the circular film on the Net is quite different: Lovers knew well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when a Bosnian Muslim woman is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
What is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bourée."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on it, as Jolie says, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fans can bring peace to him: by illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything goes well with the Irish again.
no trace of condensation.
That is why the local team is overdominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans roar with joy on the basis of a strong music, they shake their feet.
Bailey-Pub of Cork in Ireland in the south vibrating due to players launching and succeeding to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in the drinking gobelets of the opponent team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner pushes 500 Euros plus a ticket to see him in January in Las Vegas at the world's beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man is seeking to have fun, to turn away from the terrible question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, he will conduct employment interviews in New Zealand.
"But I'm trying a strange feeling," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have any employment."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she's decoupled her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark prospects, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a rate of emigration comparable to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes over.
The economic crisis, however, affects mainly Irish young people, well-trained, who have so far only known happy times.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But in the meantime, three people under 30 years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes a lot of readers' letters written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the drive."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity to do so will be a whole generation."
"The last to leave the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish students' union, sees a more dark future because the government just throws away the powder in the eyes and offers no prospect of the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her friends crawling out of an unpaid practical stage to another.
She says that they are her greatest concern is to migrate themselves in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" salon, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Sean O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the loan contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little bad," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't see much more."
He bursts out of a jammed laugh by going through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars with large brands are stationed on access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, financed 100 per cent by credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything get worse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, wakes up from the hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even through everything, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived in the island," he said.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea is in Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there's still one thing that worries you very much these last days: the party to organize on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye night.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long gorge of beer.
"A bye-bye, it seems all the same worrying."
"Let's call it a night of reindeer, all laid down, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as for private businesses.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents to Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but strongly increased compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America broke down support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the United States have only experienced a brief recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased slightly only in 2009 and again decreased by 32 per cent this year.)
But the humidity varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents to Latin America as a whole quoted crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been victims of a criminal act during the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is responsible for many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, replaced by last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influential by respondents to Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Loud Voice
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country sign up and spit in fear.
A new ballot box and a new ballot, ballot papers distributed in the gouts, shackled ballot offices and intimidations were presented.
The polling stations would open late in the evening.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were displaced after the January earthquake, would be wrong in the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them ended up abandoning.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of alleged supporters, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are remunerated to René Préval, the president of the populace, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected turn is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first woman, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceived support from the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second tower.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
About 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, received a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate of 20 points, to more than 50%; this was her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, to turn this into a successful campaign for a second term of office in the next year's election could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their additional income on a voluntary basis.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has collapsed in the development following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart crisis on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement have joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President an even greater margin of manoeuvre for volunteering.
The economy is largely overheated: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage claims of trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up his post in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made a priority of growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, hacked the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
Inflation, however, led to a sharp rise in growth as a result of a strong evaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the debtors who had refused a previously forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández looks to be edifying towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it does some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is like a prelude to the sanitation of INDIC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to earn the support of the middle class, which is very popular.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will reflect.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to refuse, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A half-hour for China
The Taiwanese electors are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his older brother on the other side of the road?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves on 27 November, 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal advisers in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings in relation to the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China, which has been said in 1949.
Mr. I've managed the test, but it's all right.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three out of five mayors, he failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic and Progressive Party (DPP), which turned to Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all the votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event exposed most of the main subjects of Taiwanese elections, including campaign trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum maintenance.
An attempt to kill mandatory mysteriously has also been made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate in the custody of the election.
A man from the crowd shot on young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Suddenly, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the election.
It was striking how far the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates China's military threat.
As a result, KMT tends to prevent its relationship with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from apprising Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to mourn Taiwan, from returning to the barracks.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself in any way.
Two years ago, it was bad: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison for corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a proponent for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and the PDP work together to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a presidential candidate for the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to challenge the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have trouble choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT needs to do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been weak; despite a vertigo economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says that his cabinet as well as his local antennas will be removed.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
At the request of a president, people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer by President Obama to take place at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist must not leave more than three albums before registration; which "sets the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaged vocal style, its hand capable of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a scored line in Spalding with regard to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards voters have just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a turning on a revigorating frisson of a recording that was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition in particular.
Thrombone Shorty, who has a strong voice in New Orleans and is invited to "Treme" in HBO, has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; he is also strongly inclined to a certain merger with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The secret Society of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the large group category; in competition with the rich room-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a great example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
In the head of the nominations, we quote Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in line for a reward.
The classic nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year sets out five candidates: Blancon Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" by various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg de l'Orchestre du Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho by the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin by the Orchestra and the choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers that are in place for Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatto Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 was first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil warehouse Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had recently written the work of 15 minutes specifically for the interpreter at the Avi Avi Avital Mandolin, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a lot of North Africa's ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The head of the orchestra Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra benefits, to have led the Symphonic Orchestra of Chicago in a recording of the works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solitist vocalists; these are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jesse Norman received a nomination for his recording "Ratines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took part in the project, claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners agreed on Wednesday night that the new religious centre was respecting local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in the short term, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another single planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-exist without incident in the Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque in the Mediterranean-style architecture would be made up of two minerals and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4,32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral lycee.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have found that bacteria discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are asking what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in life research beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss this, which did not disclose the details of the cellar, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the whole "standard" of the elements, which we think is absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a solid discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that one microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have a problem distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is quite different so that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, somehow, rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers have collected the known bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and have exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, deputy professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to train life, not only the way life on Earth was trained at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs of stolen exposure were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the Los Angeles county announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two chutas and two pembroke gallois baskets - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they spent the night outside a Belflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"A survey is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for the animals of the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's agents found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and excepted, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek planned to show regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were taken away until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championship "AKC/Eukauba" of Long Beach, where they were to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukakuba", Peek said in the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour for almost a month from the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and get their truck outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, to the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows so dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the flight of the truck at 6 o'clock on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the cages, with a micropile implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redecorate again, the restructuring of MGM expects more than the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to resume to zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be eliminated; opening the way to the entertainment business, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television broadcasts.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the United States bankruptcy code, there are no longer any legal obstacles to MGM in order to return to the care of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a smooth studio.
Staff will be brought back to about 320 to 400 in advance.
MGM will not actually divest Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself is worth $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Investment Bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise the management on how to place its finances, since it did not have the means to pay interest to $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the sale of the auctions attracted few bidders, among which none of them were willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more than the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to reconsider everything while the MGM team had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million-dollar award for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "prime success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to restart the production of MGM, which has only one film this year, and put in place an annual list of seven or eight films that would come out from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to maintain your balance gift budget
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful game is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wolesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more force; yet, at the same price rather than a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button pile games are increasing, as well as rechargeable pile games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are playmates of the size of an Indian cock that sings a note when pressing them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspiring Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays role-turned games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulations with wheel-blocking.
Children who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a bag full of questions card games designed to turn a car ball into a session with a self-correction and a van classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games are not as effective as the Leafster Explorer ($70, for the 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and bright screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-type system to provide games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks with only one box of light, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an imprompt orthography competition.
In addition, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit from the club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be a roulette pans or a pet play Puffle.
slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-bots with button stack.
Bestial fake moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
She's also strong.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's neck.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin had a place in the city as a urban sergeant in training by carefully inspecting his nervous charges, by issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted women's gang members - who were responsible for the public order in China, fearful and despised for their arbitrary repression and their guilt for violence - to pass a certain impression on a group of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be strong!"
Show them, he says, "What do beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely passed the adolescence in white gloves, clothing and identical olive-color pants, were looking at you.
Four pairs of black toe shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four well-trained hats perfectly pierced at the top of the hair attached by a reddish-blue and white knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with contempt.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree of study.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaged blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced his eyes with a strong one: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack carriage with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the co-porteur finished his business and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the degrossian police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble looking at this underground urban brigade of China.
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media show news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after using his mobile phone to film them as they spread a protest against a waste disposal.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin's inspectors, was taken off and put online, describes how he effectively beats criminals without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a Pasteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a bakery with five officers.
A video game featuring violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in the siege of street vendors.
"Chengguuan marked the government," said China Daily last year, a national publication, after a single policy on tactics.
The newspaper called for "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district went through an announcement in October to find eight new women's recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of the two.
The district's announcement required women's candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five faces in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The 26-year-old pension is compulsory.
Officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their picture that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, an almost government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; this is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temper and the "internal qualities."
Chengguan's women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not follow this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the face.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities should not post.
"We can't leave a person who's boxing or a boss coming here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the puzzled games with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the evaluation of her appearance as a sexist, she said.
"Do you think I'm having sex in this uniform?" she asked you for a casual air.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the 21-year-old fossils, says, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they were feeding more career ambitions than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen ambulances that move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu, while a salesman was walking away, temporarily abandoning his bike-carrett to the nugget.
Agents describe their functions as monotones rather than burns.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to alert the offenders to their superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposure to bureaucracy that is common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen policemen and gangguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two layers of houses in the placid place Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulation imposes on them.
The owner of the motorcycle was creating the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the face of the crash, broke a track at the tail to their vehicle and went off at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, coordinators - 40-year-olds or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a raw image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li of yours.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting in a case related to an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidency until the scandal surrounding his case made the big national titles last year and undermined his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of holding anything against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many external ethics lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would have been significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had intended to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law of lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the said ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a plot for violation and substantial violation of the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients of a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge has refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed to be aggrieved political prosecutions after a number of high-level claims by its public integrity section, including the last year's decisions to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens charged with misconduct of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, Melanie Sloan, the Director-General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officers can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed him in a communiqué on Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made in the parquet.
"I am not easy to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was all but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after receiving Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "martling" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had engaged Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors and resigned from his position to lead the fourth Republican class in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to challenge a third mandate in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator would hope that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice quickly and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call points to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were being tapped away in the ranks of the audience room.
They sent every minute of the terrible witness reports via Twitter.
Finally, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should start on an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that has failed to make any appeal, which is likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing is that intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could lead judges to debate the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms is a violation of human rights to an equitable trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, has therefore rejected the claims in the trial made last week, claiming that the media were "well controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courses have been recognizing for decades that the media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that took place, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of an osteopathy of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the trial " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "Le Fugitif".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she has been arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instantaneous communication from hearing rooms could allow for a fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many other descriptions of Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which can be discussed for years, which delays execution.
The defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the potential jury's reactions by showing them pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury stated that they had been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused the pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to a hearing in a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates at the Governor's post and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media continued to attach the flame to the emotions of the case.
"The daily tweets of the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "were nothing like what had been seen earlier here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement that the new instantaneouss were more inflamed than those reported more slowly was a ludicrous view that would support the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the tides closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-curricular sign of genuine bilateral cooperation to the front or an illustrative moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any breakthroughs on the major issues that should be dealt with during the session of the "candant".
But of course, there was at least a polar discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Commission's public meeting on Wednesday on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; however, it still divides members.
It is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a time of trial and mutual trial to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partial war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"He has no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
Elections spark partial passions and then they burst out.
It's okay."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxed" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or a whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise can be considered on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because the Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "box canard", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "duck-lame" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely or inevitable.
"When things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be in line with their promises to reduce public expenditure and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partial positions are now clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, rejecting retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they themselves have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had trouble reaching that number.
The largest resistance remains among the group's electors, which suggests that there are at least some reasons for or willingness to compromise on tax issues today.
Galston envisages two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first year will come in the form of partial confrontations, given that the Republicans contest Obama with regard to budget, tax and health care, and will then be followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partial spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will observe carefully the public's response.
The person who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But this would nevertheless be an optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more efforts on the part of both sides to find a framework of understanding on the issues that still divide them.
American documents released describe Moscow as a source of corruption
The city's control is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes it pass to Kremlin some of the wine pot and the protection money it collects, signaled the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes part while the money moves upwards of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
She was written while Yuri Loujkov was still Major of Moscow; and he was largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been little cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a first-rate construction company, have always denied the allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several protests on these accusations.
In September, he stated what follows on a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a shocking majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unheard of to think that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government acted more like a cliptocracy than a government," according to the embassy note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krisha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire government bureaucrat of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, regular criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (but rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the application for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closing under a pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption, but he admitted little progress.
The embassy's note transmits income accounts from men who bring suitcases, probably full of money, to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was classified 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which had only been made yesterday, late in the evening, in Moscow time, will certainly remove the disturbances within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin issued the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and responded in anger to the statements that US diplomats had disclosed by appealr Batman and approaching Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in that country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be accomplished with such pride, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The former Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with concrete walls of poor quality, Anlong Veng's high school director referred to the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when he was in the head of the Khmer Reds, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Khmers reds in the north-west of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the government, the long-term loyalty was finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high-school manual that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Reds to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, delivered its first ruling on a former member of the Khmer Red, condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former chief of the sadty famous torture centre of Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this change in the situation, anxiety has increased among the former combatants of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fears among the former Khmer Reds but they are powerless to do whatever it is," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the Khmer rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-led peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, major groups of Red Khmer fighters began to deteriorate to the government, culminating in the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their benefits, most of the former Red Khmer fighters were in black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are unqualified farmers in the low grade and records.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed of the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a business environment is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before installing in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmers was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The current Khmer Court also raised concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarry and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he has not said whether he continued beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Khmer Red in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodia Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was pouring long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Reds.
If the court called her, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there is more persecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who made the Khmer Red in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
"Cambodge must cross a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia needs to do to get ahead, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to recognize the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Reds, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Reds.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's young people know only a few details about the Khmer Reds, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at the Anlong Veng high school, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded with skepticism when he returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are disappointed because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Red retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, flooded by the bad herbs and patched with plastic bags, leads to a black dirt rectangle, covered with a rolled table roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, who was a mobile salesperson on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray, she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's anniversary and later on that day she planned to go to the last place of Pol Pot's rest where she would leave a bunch of bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus accepts to renounce its military uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this fate is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have left the horizon in the last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This opened the way to a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a official who referred to the condition of the anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to extend an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.
"It proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton has qualified the "very significant, important step-by-step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama made a commitment in Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials that are worldwide vulnerable in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and low-rich uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, they indicated the responsibility.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stocked and disposed of, reported to be responsible.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the managers.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A detailed coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Reduction of the World Menace.
According to estimates from the Study Centre of Non-Proliferation James Martin, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of uranium highly enriched.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"All in welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the country and its citizens' progress," she said.
The government has not issued any objection to CIA flights
The government has not issued any objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks on the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate oversight of foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which charged with complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, Spain held a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprising to the Government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From the Vega, he stressed that Spain has no objection as to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "take them to the depurvu," Aguirre says in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "was willing to give the lowest possible profile to this case, even though, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than about the classified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal with the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators to "to avoid comments from a heated rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part in any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parishioner who passed on to the blind complained in the network of the "accomplishment" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Third to Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was small, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of Coruña whose origin she was.
The messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new little friend shortly after that.
The elite was Alberto, a young man from Lousama, a neighboring town.
With him, she's been coexisting for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of its communications, it is heard that their idyllic has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Minorque, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and old because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it showed him a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day long and not to have the freedom to do what he wants to do."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like it, leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she speaks of the return to her village: "I'm leaving this week, but I'll only stay there until 19, because the 20 I have to present myself to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything was going well, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is to say, with me, and I will never let him live with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of this month, was allegedly murdered on the 10th.
"César is happy on the one hand, but he's not on the other."
"He's on one side with me and he likes this place a little, but he's on the other side of the school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and as that I save some money from the baby-sitter."
On 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when it's time for you to come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know any videos to the e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "I'm getting ahead of money."
On the Internet it has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terreur a la Galician (epigraphe) " .
The last man who lived with her, cautiously, expresses his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was going on because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica joined Palma's provincial penitentiary yesterday, from the juvenile detention center in Minorque.
Officer Carlos Maceda explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she had no intention of harming the minor."
She had previously admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in the votes and votes recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these double comets is usually the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalans received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomy, they received 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by the withdrawal of the PSC vote and the fidilization of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PSC could have passed from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would have gained four (now 10) and PSC lost no more than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while the ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda remained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comics, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relationship with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the fact that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would no longer be able to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training lost its representation in Barcelona's mayor - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Information Office of the Barcelone Police formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the fact that "the Kampai operation" has been "debilitated" by Al Qaida's international falsification device and thus "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they have been falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is the only one that the jihadist network has been operating in Europe, which is why investigations have participated, apart from Thai services, in other European police units, so that in the territory of the European Union there may be the following days of similar hits in Barcelona on Tuesday night.
In coordination with this operation (retained by Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatounde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Siriklaya Kyjbumrung.
They were those who ran the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - one of which was hit in 2009 - mainly flew from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Researchers point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay assassination, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was committed, in Catalonia a few thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that was "invested" to purchase mobile cards that were used after the "commando" components that killed 106 people.
The police have come up with a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to personally expose to Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign, which summarizes the priority of the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address in half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples arrived at the meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gave him 18 elected Members last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that the opposition will hold in the polling of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of the political leaders are being held in the key Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common interest in increasing the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and eliminating the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mac's investment negotiations will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a strong opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "miss of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The Geriatrics La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people who he was responsible for at the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Cáñada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be the one to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability".
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer because it has not detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime of August 2009 and that from that day on he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected in many cases that no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there's only one indication of imprudentness on the part of any other person who is not accused."
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" confessed 11 murders earlier today and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of medical staff from the centre.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, burned them inside by giving them as he has already acknowledged that he has done with the three women he killed in the range of 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, no longer the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the different versions Vila made in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of how to kill after successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday's threat that "the markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
Differences in peripherals have been forced and European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely recorded an incretion, which is an interesting signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by close short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least by March" and maintain the sale to quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and if they continue to be blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and that they had collapsed the markets, the story could happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the basooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday's one-year trafficking in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous survey.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 base points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a period of up to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and there is not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains in an uncertain home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange went up by 4.5%, the double as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available in cash, the triple compared to March, very expensive types and they cut access to the daily markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to show it."
Courage, we can get out of this!
The President of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest this because he considers it "no law", the court council of El Enebro the next 16, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to claim their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodega Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
The Board of Directors has been excluded from the Board by five of its seven sons who have been appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, whose dispute is recorded in the Register of Commerce and Societies.
The court council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the tonnerres box within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the assembly's convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "despite of the petitioners of his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly misleading the Law and abuse of the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be challenged once the assembly has taken place, considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a corporation owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the requested service group still enjoys 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements to real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selection of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new event that had just arrived, despite the uphill journey of the last season, last November, in the final stage of the championship, they all peered over the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a champion driver, German Sebastian Vette, no longer the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains of factories worldwide, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding the possible defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon photo devices, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and run "in less hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there was an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design any kind of change in the balls.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull balls except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are amended.
Changes can pass from virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a unique limitation of this technological development gap, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its balls in a place 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
All that goes down there is considered "top secret".
Staff for this duty count 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy drink brand has put in service for its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and none of the notoriety.
The engineering director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R+D progress in the case of racing cars was 50% of the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remanja store located on the Grand Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American Group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible shops, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
HM's management of personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff from institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a system of franchise and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
Barcelona's store includes an area with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP's computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell pays a million customers to its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's representative administrator, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a breakdown of the margins of interest, which will be tried to offset partly with commissions' in creases and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year maturity.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to use FROB's public grants, is to gain a market share through the capture of a million new special customers - 700,000 if those who can be removed from the bank - its great task to be accomplished, as so far this bank has made more SMEs and companies than the particular client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5 per cent, while it exceeds 10% for companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity parity, or the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now reluctant to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise his Optima Director's plan this year, established four years ago, even though the plan was originally for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalises the margins - reduces, the price of risk premiums paid by banks and cash for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that Spain "will be asked for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured him.
He argues that capital needs "extensively increase" and that some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but rather than what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term funding through rest, which slows down the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The Director-General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings cash mergers and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Épargnes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarreita, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been realized, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completely realized; it is possible that, instead of 17 they go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated much in this operation too," the leader stressed.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatized.
"The 45 cash flow with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is an unequal process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be consistent with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of rather unhappily views on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serocity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain has made is to remember that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
ECCA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed it to people who doubt it to a "miss of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "go to the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had suffered well from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement or removal agencies of the 426 euro aid to unemployed people without a professional contribution to privatization of 49% of AENA, management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On another occasion, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the critics of the Angela Merkel chancellor on his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with it to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany began to speculate on the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is Mark's recovery, although it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extend to the private sector the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the difference between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour and stability plans of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, she has been a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it speeded up the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on, the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries that violate the rules will be severely penalized, they may be obliged to declare themselves at the end of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad if you didn't understand it.
This is not only about restoring public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquillity.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we have been given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the the thesis that must be put in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
Among the possibilities envisaged, it cannot be excluded from leaving a monetary area that is too narrow from less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
In principle, two real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) were evicted during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League and had a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behaviour and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will perform the regulatory penalty during the next match of the strike match against Axerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and various economic sums for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, non-written rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the debate in this case is due to the fact that this has been a leading team of the Royal Madrid entity (which in its Hymne displays nobleness and honor and has on occasion condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Maurinho, which adds an additional episode to its extensive history of hysterical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. if such actions are committed by fraud of law; for they are indeed actions that are in conformity with the sport regulation, but seem to escape its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports mind.
One of the things that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has not been any violent game.
Another of these items that are alluded to with the right game is to avoid that the team of the criminal players takes advantage of the other team unfairly, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Royal Madrid players is that it does not complicate itself in the normal character of fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has specifically tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders receive from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not gain an advantage in the same match no more, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with less players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game no more, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team could be eliminated all at once and in part, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than the first round.
So, recording the steps, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, but they are part of the strategic decision-making process that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose rather the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without enjoying or escaping the penalty.
Even though the border between engineering and the fraud of the law is spread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: there were two self-evictions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on a range of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between €20 and €30.
Like the turon and the lottery, when December comes, there are also groups that come back to dinner before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the Barcelona restaurants and entertainment, but who, because of the crisis, have started in an offensive price adjusted to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or meal, coincide with businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) focused on applications in the week of 13 December, which has so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the days pic (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing last week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauração de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the boss is now unable to predict how the festivals will be held this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a scale with the crisis, so that the euro round is becoming majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres of the centre, there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Group of Soteras indicates that there is an authentic application boom for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than EUR 30, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of EUR 25 to 35.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar has meant more early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all the costs of €19.95 to €30," they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Qu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after having detected an escoration of billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the festivals in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for the night, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than the year spent demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the champanzee method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the Fécasarm patronate (which includes entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its Vice-President, Enric Gomà, is committed to the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiated to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivals has not fallen, regardless of who pays, indicates it.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme generates great concern for the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filterings confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clear and enjoyable details of the discussions and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the established Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, states in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and as a reason for maintaining caution.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is ever-reducing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan's nuclear weapons production.
A mission from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end up with the silent support of terrorist groups".
In the pursuit of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red alert to follow the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, but it was dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtration of over four million United States diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20th the international police force in Lyon (France) issued Sweden's order, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Even though Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call re notice a free way for arrest -- which the national police body must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case in Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is located.
The movement provoked the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks, who was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that he was compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin.
"That seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the mission denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not at home.
On Monday, he gave an interview with the Director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American diplomats that they owe to the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "religious and absurd" the application for resignation.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to provide contributions or assistance to anyone".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's adviser Stephen Harper, has to return to his statements after saying that Assange must be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possibly a presidential candidate.
"The person who is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with eyebrows at Carod fans
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe to resolve the third internal revolution within the ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the leaders of former leader Josep Lluís Card-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as widespread as his liar and that it cannot at all give him any ills that he had with other leaks.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyebrows that allow him to wander to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to speak on his continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If cardiologists want to drive a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the class wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half more than one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good anymore.
The people close to Card require the president to put his position at the disposal of the campaign, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the maximum body among the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercos in exchange for his promise to program the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The head of the ERC admitted that the "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make it once for all the organization capable of washing its family room linen.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considering Puigcercós' ideology, the owner of Innovation thought that the leader's ratification of "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he highlights.
The first, "recomposit" the executive to represent at least 90% of the campaign, i.e., includes new figures coming from the appropriate sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquid once for all the assembly as a operating mechanism.
It thus advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be held through delegates elected by affliction.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession with the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave led the management to review the assembly model at a specific status reform conference.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend that this issue be discussed.
Now, without critical sectors in the future, the moment could be good for it to be resumed and closed forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
These three women are mentioned among the murders and the discovery of two bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases are the one of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms and the head, except for feet and hands attached with a cable.
The following day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlan, of the municipality of Naukalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, the four owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the sector that crosses the village Villa Guerrero.
Almost the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight blows of fire when he left his house to start the collection of orders.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head-on impact of fire in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the fire blow in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely road by Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet hit by a 25-caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the Blackwater Canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorado, the hands tied behind and the eyes tied.
The man had an injury caused by a blow of fire in the nude.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been involved in covers and abandoned in the safe of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza was reported, at the same time with the victims two death warning messages.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located, which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the nuke, one found the dead body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin there were tattoos of Santa Death and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impactes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their head in the year and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, who said, "This is what is happening to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the St. Augustine Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a canal rubber and a side message; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 has ensured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and has detailed that he maintains his offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, ensuring Su Wei, a representative of the country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert his industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been recorded in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed in relation to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy saving objectives, use of energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, it stated that there are various multi-annual plans in progress or completed, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country with regard to climate change, has ensured that China's efforts have been greater than we thought.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and intends to do another similar to 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN said that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In his previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, where appropriate, by making a claim to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Action National would be stronger after the internal elections of 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, that has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; rather, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt elect the best leader/man in need of National Action for the next three years, so it would give the reference "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party's president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's resumption to the elections last July 4th will be reflected in the next dispute, even though "it's not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that are making alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of 'armour'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions such as those made in his speech in the National Auditor, because there is no balloon in the country, and even less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twittte the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
Its short message maintains a cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the increase in taxes of the time of Bush and government funding is prolonged.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Lockdown of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs spokesperson said that he is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved, we will be able to set up an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in that sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legitimize undocumented students could be voted from Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely is next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Reves Act would legislate 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, who remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the party organizations of the protagonists project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
At least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the participants in the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most polite Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator from George Lemieux, Florida, who completed his term as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not so far defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the patch
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a promenade in which participants highlighted the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the sub-title of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained it).
The finger on the plague"...we put in the embarras," slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who were gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "beach" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only the clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiousologist she comes out convinced: "The patience is not my strength, it may be my plague."
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the color, but who explains that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is actually opened, the symbol is the scar."
The suppliant protagonist is relieved and concludes: "On the plague I only knew that it is open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very closely linked to them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling story he titled Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the plague is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With the touch of magical reality, he spoke of a famous ensorcelle who touched clouds, made people who had gone away or repaired the virtues of a lady who had lost, a story that came to talk next to America, the great news that had had its own chroniclers from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excessive narratives of the conquerors.
"Cervents who invented us all (the writers) have mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way one would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was even missing from the powder."
Nevertheless, he pointed out that "the fools and the mentors have the best imagination" and here the reality is converging with the lie, we no longer know which part of the story belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apoge.
It's actually called the "Tradition of Cervantes."
"It's because of his legacy that we're counting on him."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The duty on the plague.
The Cuban-Portorician has focused on the great plague of social violence that her country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - has produced disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs refer to a tacit commitment that is not very preceeding," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the reader.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "the duty on the strike of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed as well as in terms of intellectual habits and the control of the consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatisms, "after each claim there is a little no and after each negation there is a little yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must be nuanced: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the plague and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuances, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the final series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles that confront themselves, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals, he had high and low in his career, but he had reached the final series three times, even though so far he has not put in a thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
Argentina ended up comforting herself with the championship medal, it remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team it played successful finals.
The most holy strategy came to its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held Morelia's reindeer with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in 2003 he also reached the final duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournoi, Rubén again suffered a relapse, because his team made a match equal to 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players dropped 11 meters and he suffered the shock at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to be the same, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims the institution is more important to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the Timonier when he was asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the referee simmers the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot us were already prepared to run, and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end in a regular time, but sometimes we just prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of keeping the title between our hands, hands he has failed us, it has served us as a lesson for this end and we hope that we will no longer get into this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedure for the processing of visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to submit to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will receive the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of dealing with the visa will be lower, no longer will be required to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a unique payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visas.
People who wish to renew their visas should not present themselves in an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear in the closer ASC where they will present the documents and be printed.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra 26-dollar service rate.
For further information on the new procedure to request visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/boletines/sp10101_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency quoted the press as presenting a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA ensured that she would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which caused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, which lives in an environment that we thought too useful for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life might exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
German PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Congress Act, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce it.
The 60th was due to be installed when in Congress there was a block of opposition led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonnain' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, the 'bipartisan' is being launched because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control Congress.
The four MPs, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the PANIST President Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme by political will and if they did not, they would be once again served by both parties, and in this way the opposing coalition would end.
"Since this happened (the opposition coalition), that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political preference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Pattern and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he has continued, that the Congress, after being monopolitic, is now "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that Congress was now transformed into a 'butin' between two, making an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Mr Montalvo asked him to respect the character of the MP, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave us with collective agreements outside 5 which are likely to be 9 Members, now at five that we see, separated from different groups, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million extra for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles.
According to the municipality's transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in terms of "delivery settlement".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and therefore how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We bought nothing, we just pay him what he needs, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when an undertaking is questioned by ASE, to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July in the Northwest, had published a review of the cheques issued by Mairie to its suppliers, revealing that in the March 2008 - July 2010 period, in the triennat of Mare Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the paying municipality of Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, has 42 cheques.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, covering checks of more than 3 million weights.
Tourist sites should be provided
Tourists regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should be replaced by others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks had affected because tourists came to see the disorder and avoid close trades.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, otherwise they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist crash exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance of the Mairie part.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not just the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live in, and Mary needs to change her strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the property in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't pay attention to them, and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is familiar to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and design a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to go online with the municipality and be a priority for having the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned and put on the line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Demands Results at Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members should be given the greatest responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
The business sector in Mazatlan seeks a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is confused and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislation, formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, was installed.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need a responsible legislative work and that the same model of party or patronage does not repeat itself.
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members should be given the greatest responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make treaties to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival mask of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and especially committed work with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they increase economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he had in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat for Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important and generous economic activity of foreign exchange and investment that directly competes with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified as resources for detonating tourism projects that help to provide support to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king magge
Babies, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Mages Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a head.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family has a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live up to the day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and after noon I go out with the 'pules' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, and his 3 year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
In his turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Cayetana suggests size clothing for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive,' remembers Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11-year-old, had a 12-year-old shoe; Isaiah, 10-year-old, had a 10-year-old shoe, while 8-year-old Miguel had eight-year-old shoes.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the Northwest reception.
14 drug traffickers suspected arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Austria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used in the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Québec Security spokesman.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leading leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to be compared to the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with charges of cannabis production, possession in order to traffic, plot and flight services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-haline investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Québec Security Strait, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Region took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships in charge of clandestine migrants, is clearly to be fought, while the three opposition parties indicated on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I stand up with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow to hold up to one year from a ship identified as a carrier of clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties to the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticism that its party is not strong enough about clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree to take action against clandestine passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the draft Conservative law because it takes refugees and jails children for at least a year," said Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians massively tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a strawberry."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that would have rejected it.
A conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposition MP would then explain himself to his electors.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation commission on this subject.
The Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil maintains that this idea is not a date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this matter on January last.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a permanent meeting of the Québec Police Service Council on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed in spite of Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the pequist public security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad "lapin out of a hat" and a "brilled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, he's happy to say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr Charest insists that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To escape this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor-General to investigate the collapse and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believed that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling him to make people witness.
The creation of a permanent shield is not the only project in the cartoons of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the Prosecutor of Operation Marseau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is now thinking about some of the amendments in this case.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Act on gangsterism.
High surveillance rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have fallen on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landing took place on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glimmer would occur in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road's gone.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimeters of extra rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouai valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitates need to be added to the already accumulated snow source in some sectors, several water courses are feared.
Warnings of flood alerts were issued on Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Oueau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The North, in St. Jerome, in the Laurentides, and in China, in Lotbinier, were the subject of floods and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitation led to the landing of some lakes, in Sainte-Julian, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outauais, the landing of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield- and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on an alert foot and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Crusade Forecast Centre has for its part issued on Wednesday strong crusades warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blame dupont
Québec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont has made a partial return to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial issues about social assistance and Haitians as well as their wholesale language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the issues contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, indiscriminately negative representations of Haitians and wholesale language that did not correspond to broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Social Assistance in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were incorrect.
Animators must provide solid information rather than frauds.
As for suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide as a trigger.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dubont the Midi" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been held in place.
The last dispute covered statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media-faced face that had generated many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had made no donations to help the Haitians because we could not know for sure that the needy would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an indisputable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already had my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of wholesale language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "in addition to his obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large listening within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montréal
The Algerian Montréal of origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing mounts up the tatami and the world's rings to find new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground, in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a commission for the UPS has just delivered bad news to its rivers, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Cup Championship (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and boxing Thai, he explained."
"Now, I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Show."
"The combatants who ended up among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sanda" is an original discipline of China where the punching and footing, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels initially take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most famous and most prestigious in China, explained the nice galillard."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-end of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-finals winners finally face their category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor that has obtained the most important project management for a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in a way that coincided with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium undermined the contract profit without calling for public tenders.
For the Québec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"It's the new way to get involved and get the competition down."
"That is, people, instead of doing so in secret, are now doing it in an open way," said Peach MP Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said that he would find it difficult to see how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon that there had been a collapse for this contract.
"I began to have my journey," she said, bearing that the PQ had been "bad luck" and had "missing hard".
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologized for.
Consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the scope of the work.
The building is in progress and must be phased out until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As stated last week, the Board of Directors of the Consortium of the Consortium in the Engineering Council sector was investigated by the government.
A rapid overvolving of the Québec Business Register enables more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and even moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is responding to particular man-work dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to them since the 1970s".
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Bay James Energy Society (SEBJ), provided an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract was granted willingly.
"If you're making offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market or you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, that is the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering and consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firmers or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin reached 22 contracts, Geneva obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, with no participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract in Energy management of $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has made it clear that the PQ is also linked to those firms that are "funding it" before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in equitable brands and environmental certifications to guide its choices.
In fact, even if he is engaged in a media universe where the messages for a more responsible consumption are pulsating, he deplores a lack of credible information, because he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the company's environmental commitment as well as the company's green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Observatory for Consumers.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications based on the said fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this diet of current consumption by nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the vagueness and questionable nature of the information would calm the burnings of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also saying that they are as suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services as they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 to a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
However, its social and environmental consciousness seems to remain outside its car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used transport in common or had recommended co-location to defend their green interests.
The march and the bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but in the course of a loan only.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who would expect a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving it its full kinephilic vocation, did not receive what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would otherwise be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least from the opinion of the sources of the State's offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have since been reviewed at a low level.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is driving the eXcentris file.
He made it a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to answer until 31 December.
However, it seems that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be eliminated.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinemas and Cinemas Owners in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinema rooms.
However, a number of environmental stakeholders claimed substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the scene, had for ten years carried the author's cinema in his complex premises after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is creating in Montreal, and eXcentris had its clientele trusted.
The Angus Society and the Parallele, with their head Christian Yaccarini, piloted a private funding campaign on their side, hoping to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir, and we ignore what he and his group think about the low proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the view that the United States considers Canadians to be the inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are amazed that every Canadian elector did not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believing that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located in the public square yesterday, offer more cross-cutting details than the substantial content to be put under the teeth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008 — in the federal electoral campaign — relates to what extent the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US ambassador in post in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal everyday issues rather than make this election over the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign) ", he writes.
Thus, the United States concludes that "the elephant probial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands so little of this "suffering silence" that both countries have a strong political and economic relationship.
"A candidate's ability, a party's ability, and more than one party's leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor in the voter's mind."
The other expression of this sense of importance lies in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the early February vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit over a decade due to a resumption plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention was made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that opposition parties made their conditional survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevent Washington from becoming increasingly negative than the drama series broadcast to CBC from sending to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or to the CIA's musculoskeletal interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "house by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Let's finally note that the spirits fail about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former very close adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee was echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renewal of Light
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds almost to the third of the additional reduction to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolies still from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluo-compact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode (DEL or "LED") bulbs, the essence of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should lead to global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be subtracted from this budget by 5 Gt in order to stabilise the rise in the climate by 2020 at 2 centigrades in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, is produced from light.
With fluo-compact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new ampoules in DEL, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluo-compact ampoules average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs in DEL, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reestates as well as very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations instead of fluo-compact ampoules because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but rather the thermal power plants in coal, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is anxious to announce election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon requested the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without delay, has highlighted a spokesperson of the United Nations Chief of Staff."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the Friday morning but did not publish the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chair of the IEC had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CEI finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second round between the exit Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is counting on the abolition by the Constitutional Council of "false" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (UN) since the coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the campaign of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidating maneuvers of the UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the president from going to vote.
Any election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who detachs all ties with the former rebels, considered the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that it would be illegal to complain to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, was intended to co-ordinate the process of reconciling and reconciling a country in two years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent in Alaskan Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at the 3rd quarter
The rate of unemployment in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% with the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the seasonal changes (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data in the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the rate of unemployment appears at a higher level of 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has yet to deteriorate, with a new increase in unemployment rate, bringing to 24.2% by metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% by including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed within the meaning of the IDB.
The elderly have experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and one year), or 482,000 people over 50 years of age or over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from a stability of unemployment at the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini reviewed and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, leader of the PS President-in-Office of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was examined and crushed at the Luynes Home, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, recoil, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove it," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man's brother of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, had to pass a memo before his hearing to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and night.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but make the discharges he had to manage.
As to the award of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew of them, Me Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Aglomation Services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public and complicity funds, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the file's protagonists.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts that have offended him."
"The teacher's magistrate took it into account not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with a judicial check on two of them, the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin indicated.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being pursued for "trafficking influence and passive corruption".
Two staff members of the Aubagne Assembly, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, are considered one for "suspension and diversion of public goods by a person responsible for a public service mission", the other for "complicated diversion of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "reel of abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets affecting the Corse.
The investigators suspect that their companies have served to whitewash the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open legal information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public markets, in particular in the waste chain.
From close source to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the wastes from Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spinning", held the Haleine opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and emphasized the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything in the eyes of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice on the treatment of their own "totage" crises in Iran (a small group of miners).
They show how the French officials were convinced Washington that the release of the French youth did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France, for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a cruel light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to validate the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Counsellor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the North Africa Quai and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are dealing with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so in order to repatriate their own nationals held by force in Iran.
"Fates of noise," they say, "martling without delay" in the media the words "the rights of fundamental man", "innocentness", "immediate release".
It is necessary to frame the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence will rule nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that arresting foreigners is "a family Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (who will take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge in the French Embassy) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
And he tells us that the Elysate anticipates other housing crises, a phenomenon that will "get worse."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for twelve days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. claims extradition for illegal trafficking of electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released to Paris on a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which traces Iranian clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear programme.
Did France accept a marketing offer?
The release of Iran against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier makes sure that this is not the case.
Elisée, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guardian of the Sceaux" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judgment" he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under the "near" surveillance of French information services.
The Counsellor of the Elysée consists of a telephone number, crack, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not attempt, by means of communications and "flows" organized in the media, to make the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play a "significant" and "influent" role.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 refers to "the media flash of French officials".
What is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is being asked.
"Despite their full declarations of praise, the French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons that led the Elysée to pay in this fiction.
The intensity of the communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as prematurated and immetriated".
In "exacting the Syrian role", Paris seeks "to demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier entrusted him with: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did whatever it was."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"It should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, have indicated government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he has specified.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents demand it, added the responsibility.
It will also make available to people who claim free software that will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the uncontested champion of world games competitions online.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates host countries
In full because of suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates the world Cup organizer countries of 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are at risk of taking action on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of the Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional base of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities made up of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government leaders Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
The treatment in shells is therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, based on the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football champion who had accepted the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that spanned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Why bother Fifa and put the English leaders in the embargo, who have been engaged in intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-issue the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the JO-2012 organisation for London in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to reduce the spread of England to the EC ?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack anything with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could give way to their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, which has become a weightier despite the shortcomings of its records (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced a "delicate competition in the preparation of the vote" in an unmistakable statement to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"They're covered in mud, they're trying to compromise," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears to be logical.
First world economic power, headquarters of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a long advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World 2026 to China, which is strongly desired by the Fifa, which would in fact render Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new conflicts, but these two countries are more at risk than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights achieved (due to the time-out) by the European countries, the nerve of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
One mandate to Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make a good house with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it has to be done as if there was always a doubt.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he took his decision "in the fall of 2011".
If he refers to MPP MPs, Tuesday night at Elysée, the perspective of "two mandates" has therefore been a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president only recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he calls the President, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"Unfortunately, or better, you've still been with me for seven and a half years," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next step."
His earlier talk does not make him more candidate than he does; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the application to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's high school entry that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to open up.
On the contrary, it is because its 2012 candidacy is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an order of battle earlier than planned.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," the Prime Minister immediately and wisely responded.
"If he believes the possible defect, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Jupped, renouncing the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the crisis exit arrangements or, at least, to announce the termination of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that have to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions will certainly not be able to be as long-term as it is not to exacerbate a situation more than it is today in the European compulsory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, by increasing, for example, its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection on my European partners (...) ".
In Brussels, at the hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, no longer stated his intentions, contenting himself to indicate that the State's securities purchase programme on the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its main exchange rate at 1%, its lower historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the Treasury's purchases by the ECB doubled last week, almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchases (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any significant change from the head.
If loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still subject to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she significantly modifies her program."
"If not, it would be at risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to encourage anatomical market," Norbert Brams added.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace himself at any price with the lack of market investors and to act in such a way as to prevent a package of performances paid by the most fragile states," a major mandatory manager said yesterday.
For if interest rates flow, the States will be so much more likely to reduce their debt, or stabilize it.
The euro's security is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the back round
After a start of a worrying week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed, yesterday, with a 10-year-old return on the mandatory rates.
A return to the precautionary calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that Giulio Tremonti had heard that the situation of "undecryptable" and expected a week's "unpredictable", which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) was 263 points, leading to a certain flood in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the athony of tax revenues that goes with, making the State at risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget for consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% provided by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is where the voice of a new budget collection could be put in place after the festivals, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy received support from international institutions.
"The basics of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short and long term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's demand for stabilization efforts are less than those requested from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD head economist.
It remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
A period of time would then be less conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still beat him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have been shown it on Sunday and at night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although all of this is true, yesterday's detention on the rates of European State obligations has brought water to the mouths of governments and the ECB.
But we still cannot talk about a beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
More than "political time is much slower than market time".
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more widely, with their G20 partners are going well.
This is also the case for meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the outcome of non-conventional support measures in the euro area countries in the market collector (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the external-oriental investors of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the land.
The first EDF securities issues are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official representative from the United States entrusted Reuters to the United States with the possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are learning to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from those in Greece and Ireland.
One and the other must at all costs avoid seeking international assistance before introducing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European fundraisers focus on the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bonds markets.
On 24 November in Paris, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of any first plan of the European sovereign debt market, believe that an amount of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquid injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
An advice that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were to prevail.
Snow and glass: 24 departments in orange surveillance
The snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and glass.
The Eure, Eure and Loir, the Two-Sèvres and the Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Metéo France, supported snowflakes affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, the Poitou and those of the Low Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are notable enough to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Méteo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmeries that recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict heavy weight movement.
The prefecture " invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has requested airlines to cancel their flights to Roissy on Thursday 25 per cent of their flights to the Paris airport and 10 per cent to Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France hits its full length, billions are flowing.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we refer to 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which must be built by the Grand Paris Society.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Law on Correctional Finance 2010, which was reviewed by the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the provisions to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the fee on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is said: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reform of a tax on offices that already exist "to modernize, increase the product and affect this increase to the Society of Grand Paris".
How much did that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society in the form and size of the project," we can read in the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time of the creation of revenue (the two taxes, dlr) we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after, we explain."
"This will be recorded in the budget and removed from the oven and measured."
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the promised 4 billion still remain to the missing subscribers, could cause a little heated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that does not appear as a scandal but in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and envisions a future dominated by regression.
But procedures by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only reported what could be read in any newspaper (except for those who own Berlusconi), and Khadafi's sadistic caricature profile has long been for skilful artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every book repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And it's not just because the author of hidden texts doesn't like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who go to occultism believe only what they already know, and who confirms what they already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is simple, and even (or limited) the head of the secret services (unless it could be, I know, editor in Liberia), who hold as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations about these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, they have become empirical centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we make it seem to ignore it.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to put American diplomacy under poor light.
Second, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a non-neglectable blow to the prestige of the state department.
Thus, the scandal does not cause both victims and "bourreals".
But let us come to the profound nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, in order to control each movement by telephone, each transaction performed, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the winner of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of preserving its own secrets be held?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said it, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret of secret, because it relates to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets meant to remove it all.
WikiLeaks did no harm in Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused by a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the street - this would go back to the publication on a displayed corner of the street.
But it is also obvious that with the current technologies, it must be hoped that you can maintain confidential telephone reports.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction is based on science-fiction and so is Romance, but I have to imagine that government agents are moving discreetly in the care of uncontrollable itineraries, being only bearers of messages from the heart or, at the very least, hiding the rare information written in the talent of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key-closed shooters: in the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the chance to write that technology is progressing now in crebes, that is to say, at rebounds.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wireless telegraph.
Videocassettes (analogic) have allowed film researchers to explore a film in step by step, moving forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow you to skip chapter in chapter, i.e. by macroports.
With the trains at high speed, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the movements it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore only extraordinary that communications policy and techniques return to riding cars.
One last comment.
On the other hand, the press was trying to understand what was happening in the embassy's secret.
At present, these are the ambassadors who are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France beats its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the rapidly disbursed funding promises (such as fixed start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the great French beehives are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played a major role in convincing its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large-page event, brochure distribution...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 EUR 2.2 billion has been spent, which puts it on the right track for compliance with its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, this money must be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and it adds 150 million over three years for fixed-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution of gifts and loans.
There again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loan is equal to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given to it... Moreover, it should not be counted as the cost of the loan for the lender country (it is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use so massively the loan.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In summary, in its fixed start-up financing, France operates a double search: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she has come to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is sufficient to lend ) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely asymptomatic...
The chapter of early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue, compared to the whole discussion on climate.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machine that is the UNICEFCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be excluded.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement about the permanent start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be likely to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-borne pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (ex-Volume for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in the light of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the food consumed in four meals and an encas in one day by a child of ten years in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as colds, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the seat is as follows: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic potential or likely and five listed carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is well seen in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea only contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three averies such as certain cancers as well as close to twenty residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as an ingredient in the study, presents traces of six chemical substances, although a fungicide is prohibited in France.
Even for Kenya's green harecots, included in the breakfast, on which the study detected traces of a powerful forbidden insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the axe stick, the box tuna, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were hit by pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastic seat used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cottails of pollutants" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance of Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
