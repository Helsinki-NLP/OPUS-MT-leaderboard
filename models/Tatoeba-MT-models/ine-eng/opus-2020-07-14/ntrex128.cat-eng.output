Members of the Galles Assembly worried about "Identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the House expressed their condolences to the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Galal Parliament).
This debate is rooted in the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Galal Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure can become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said he was concerned about the fact that MWP "removed with Twp or Pwp".
For non-galley readers: In galleys, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party's assembly commented that his party's "don't see it with good eyes" and proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a Gallean conservative member said that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name change: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint members of the assembly will, of course, be taken by the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales grants to the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Galal Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was called upon by "Members of the Galáles Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received a wider support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the intention to reach consensus can be a whole curse for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will vote definitively on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday if they want to change the name of their country for the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the fact that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns stop sounding: the difficulties of Harlem's churches
"Historically, the great people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church in each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," she says.
"The bars have stopped being that kind of living room for the neighbor where people used to go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as their leaders "and that they return later or later to the place where they came out."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominium buildings with people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they do will accelerate the closing of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condoms will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation originally existed during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to minority street merchants 125th, one of Harlem's main trade streets, who resisted to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the gladiator Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin's, described all pride in the carriage as "the campaigns of poor people."
The expert who made the carriage sound the July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first trolley in the world that was played by a black-raced musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest trolley of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has sounded to St. Martin's over the last few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought to the secular leaders of the church and others to the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote in the diocese last July while expressing its concern that the diocese "was intended to transmit the costs" to the council, although this latter was not involved in the contraction of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull wounds a 13-year-old boy while looking for lobsters in California
A bull attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was invading to seek hostages in California on the first day of the camp season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour looking for friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's screams for help, and then they stayed with a group up to where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that he first thought it was the joy of having taken a hostage, but then he realized that he was calling 'I'm biting!
They bit me!'
He had all the striped clavicle," he observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone gets out of the water, I called out, 'There's a tauron in the water!' says Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council of San Diego, where he was admitted into a serious state.
We don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
On a press wheel, relief worker Larry Giles commented that it worked for a few weeks that a bull had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the tower.
The authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablanca to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours because of investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the UK's market for beauty products
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with fashions of beauty products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large transits are only a part of a considerable investment in the UK's beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow as the fashion and household products sectors remain behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tried to expand to more shops in the year ahead if the test is successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their services that had been used for television, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will duplicate its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those that can be found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also in the process of relaunching its range of boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The Minorist Chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two salesmen from Sainsbury's. The first did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open to Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying on the Internet and changing it into a habit to buy food in smaller quantities every day to small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt to run a supermarket chain to fight off Aldi and Lidl's retail supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's went by introducing Argo's sales points to many of its supermarkets, besides a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch the sales of cheeses and increase the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous intention of the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended quickly when it failed to agree on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy came up after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmacies in Celesio, owner of LloydsPharmacy, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important paper in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our pastries of beauty products in order to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We've invested in specifically formatted workers who will be of great help at the time of offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby is behind a 11 million GBP deal.
Dragons' Den Peter Jones star went "furish" after Holly Willoughby's TV presenter turned behind a 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote himself to the business together of household products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37 - year - old presenter of this Morning used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative joint life-style business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furished" when the star red of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in his center of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new submission agreements, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane toward one of his holiday homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Now there's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's center ready to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of this Morning presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment that had been made in products, from kitchens and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays in its release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined him in charge of the president last March.
Both couples spend their vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of the participation in the Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program of the ITV.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We won't comment on his business."
Hard charges... "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider a "less than a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did he give up Trump so much?
Trump said, while making a noise noise from a news provider:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first June in Singapore was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are being halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, it noted that the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, instead, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare the war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: end of tests with missiles, help to free hostages and return home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his little usual focus on the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this neighborhood full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, all pointing out the crowd that was in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, required to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so that the situation is highly demanding," said Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not even certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, from the National Disasters Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Given the constant earthquake that afflicts Indonesia, the country continues to suffer a little prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh's shelters have been built in the case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of islands in Indonesia is, in the best case, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to accommodate the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had, as a central element of his election campaign, improved Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and invested huge amounts of money in railways and railways.
However, Joko's government faces the year it comes to the collection of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative fall faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of the wars that take place in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with swords, bows, and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the summit with a long shot in front of Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked on Saturday 89th in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Herman Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The pilot settled to the left before he let go of an incredible juxtaposition towards the second suit.
The arrow crossed the whole area with a great lift as it moved towards the right cross of the gate.
The pilot finally launched the descent over a full jumper Kepa Arrizabaaga to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create me as soon as possible," Sturridge says at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, I made a touch, and I didn't think much, I just dedicated myself to sit down."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 in a break after scored a goal in a minute 25 through his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the Blue team's front cut back a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost half a camp and jumping to Liverpool camp.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
After all, he made a wonderful past in depth, leaving Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard overcome the defense to finish the second suit with a jute with the left bed where he could not reach the porter of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the team phase of the League of Champions next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play with the videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami up to 832
The number of deaths as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported in the morning of Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the ruined buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the director of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press wheel.
The city of Palu, more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after he found a woman stabbed.
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several punches at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the inhabitants of the area who have seen or heard something about the crime they face in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "If the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to any person, especially to the taxi drivers who could have caught anything through the car-board camera, who would be contacted, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body they found was Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While the investigation continues, the police have noted that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one has allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's warning the residents that they'll be hours away until they can get back in.
He could feel like a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible!"
At 14:00 a.m., two police vans were in the area with another van parked outside.
A number of officers remained within the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Anyone is asked to have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and mention the file 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament was the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewrite the story"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the most pure style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England that were carried out by their pure followers fanatics.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and a "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the withdrawal of states, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor put into effect by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would have ended up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for his predecessor's actions that he did during the last century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, not now, as a defender of parliament in front of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation is a theme of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century media conflict conformed to our nation's subsequent development, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a gang of this division.
Their isolations as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a pig's market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepared to inject pigs into a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As it is known, he had traveled on Wednesdays with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a concussion.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg gharry had injured the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and blood-stained," said the cousin, of the name "Wu," according to the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 in the morning of Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent you from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg took a galley farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "delaying".
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of doing anything wrong.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," she said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring torrential rains across the South West of the United States
According to the pronostics, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coolest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will carry torrential rains across the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the next days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 in the morning of Sunday, hour of the East of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north towards the south-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave Monday to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous laughs, waste streams, and the possibility of land slavery in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation indexes close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially much of Arizona.
There is the possibility of laughing, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the dispersal of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in front of the tropical rain threat.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers, and storms could lead winds and dust clouds to concrete points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total precipitations above 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to lower waste streams and relicable roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They'll begin to arrive at tropical rain in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will flow to the region of the four cantons on Tuesday and will continue throughout the entire Wednesday.
October there will be several major temperature oscillations for all Americans as Arctic cooled down, although the tropics will remain very warm.
This phenomenon may at times cause drastic changes in temperature at a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
There have been differences in temperature of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in large parts of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plans area to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures above the average in the eastern United States are recorded during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a charge investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate committee on judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in a high witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company accounted for half of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Hearing numbers were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Moreover, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people you see from his office.
From a perspective, it's a hearing similar to that of an American football party or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders of which clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most audience chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during one day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second to 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
The interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a statement saying that they were voting in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was harassed by demonstrators when he was trying to get up to an elevator to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed several minutes with her eyebrows while she was live on TV at CNN.
"Here you have me, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told her 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said that his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, said he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast chains were already streaming directly to the time when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to submit it to the vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the appointment of the next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union to "play political" with the future of the United Kingdom and to undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times daily.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "of all absurdity".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree murder prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB branch.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wade died of a shot, according to the police.
His trust is set at $350 000, according to the lawyer.
East Baton Rouge's Forensics Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a firearm wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the operative group of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the local community for the research that has culminated in this detention.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the forces of the area's order for their "diligence and to seek justice".
Yess was 20 years old.
In the middle of 1,98 m, he played the ball and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 turns to leave the past season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team was "damaged" and that Wade's death was "a very strong time".
"Things like this are the things that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A sprint volcano in Mexico City
The ashes carved by the Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the south coast of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after they detected activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several strepts and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on the social networks where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the parabrises of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude earthquake 7.1 struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum anniversary on independence
Six people were detained in Barcelona last Saturday after protestors in favour of independence confronted the anti-avoidated police and thousands of people joined counter-arrival demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote held in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avalot police began to throw eggs and paint them in dust, as it caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, there were beatings with the police, who used their fists to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be exposed to legal wounds during the protests, depending on local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after October 1st was held a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also due to the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation index was low, as the opposition to the section boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the electoral colleges throughout the region, which caused violent confrontations.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said that he had no more hopes of the possibilities that Catalonia would become independent.
"We lived one of the best moments last year.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," she said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although in a few margins, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their leading leaders are in a self-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial for their paper in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the police support demonstration with his phone, and said that the conflict was launched by the politicians of both sides.
"Tension does nothing more than increase," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial from the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car repeatedly invested in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was caused to the doors and to the same building.
It's also possible that, at some point, someone shot a bullet against the car.
A Menga game gives the Livingston win for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingstone assumed victory
Livingston, who had come up this year as a category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything is the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox district club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, because, with this victory, Gary Holt's team can take the second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, continue without winning out at the Premiership this season, and the next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they will be separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, in the meantime, expands up to six parties his indicted rat in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitors' live game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, as its direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he abused his chance when he found himself in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow sent the pilot outside to try to finish the lead of Craig Halkett, who crossed the gate.
At the locals, it was good to let Rangers come to their area, as they knew they could put the visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came to be.
Arbitrary smiled at the Rangers' interests and Livingstone opened the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had little work during the party,
The scene was repeated on the other side, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a felony stop.
On his side, Rangers Allan McGregor's porter stopped with his feet one occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow turned off another liveston combination game.
The Rangers were dedicated to hanging once and another pilot in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminals were claimed, one for a alleged Halket entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and another for a hand.
Livingstone "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingstone.
A man thinks they've been excellent, and they're still surpassing all expectations in this coming journey.
Their game style and staff have not changed since they returned to the highest category, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since they arrived.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be dependent on Menga throughout the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments presented with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely didn't know how to keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded the local defense), and this Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive Reception for Erdogan in Colonia
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders from Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Colonia to launch a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police brought security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers applied to it so that they could see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also made to feel as they condemned both the politicians of Erdogan and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies to meet a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a case of atrophy with a flight to Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said their agents are working to identify the man and inform the nearest relatives of the facts.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured in an altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison center, according to the centre's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin's prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still persist.
Specialized "return" agents moved up to the scene of the events to put an end to the altercation, where eight prisoners were involved. Afalot could be held by one band.
The officers had to be cared for for by injured people in the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison spokesman, "We have deployed special prison personnel trained to try to solve an incident that occurred in Long Martin's prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be cared for with injuries.
We're not going to tolerate the violence in our prisons, and we're sure that those responsible for this altercation will have to keep accounts of the police and they might have to spend even more time on the girl."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be assaulted in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-trafficking agents took action in prison to solve a serious altercation in which the center staff was attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (the areas with even could be beneficial)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that comes when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the south-west, with the consequent risk of laughter.
The national weather service has already been alerted by rivers for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and get close to Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a pill that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The most recent models of the Hurricane National Centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including central Rockloses and the Great Conca, could be registered from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of rivers, the rain of the Rosa could become a very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although laughter is a serious cause of concern, some of the precipices could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west currently suffers from a drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa is going to play the ground on the peninsula of Lower California, Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have a hurricane force Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose power.
So it's expected to hit land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughter.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of the morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach south of Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
"The main risk that we expect of Rosa or what remains of it is very strong precipitation in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the South-West desert of the United States," according to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous rains and waste streams in the deserts, lovers of land slaving in the mountainous areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the wrath and misery" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and furious tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "pained the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared in front of the Congress on Thursday, denouncing and emotively accusing Christine Blasey Ford of having sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also stated in the view regarding his associate.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds of the legal world of our time, a lawyer with a wonderful service route to the city," he commented to the crowds of Western Virginia sympathizers.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the voter's participation index in the mid-term elections.
"We're five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as soon as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of the leaders of the Republican Party has reported.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that were blowing against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Fridays for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards the shore, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat came by tsunami yesterday, people were still leading their activities to the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who carried from the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a communiqué in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, comment.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated at 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Mitigation Agency where the amount of destroyed shops and buildings, turned bridges, and a water-covered mixture is appreciated.
The replicas continued to shake off this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
According to the agency, the city's geographical characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have significantly increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 extradited.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore there was no kind of information" in Dongala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which, unfortunately, could end much worse," he says.
The agency was strongly criticised on Saturday not to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the alert was issued.
In a recording of an affidavit shared on social networks, it can be felt as a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the tsunami approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts at the sea edge, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the recording immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut of electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Despite the fact that the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuations continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for aid tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths per tsunami in Indonesia is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Dongala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge in shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to present scenes of total destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
While the relief groups did the disillusioned gesture of initiating relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a carrier of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While he was complaining the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope of the miracle and their loved ones echoing the devastating tale of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a keyboard was rescued.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the area of the parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel between the parapentist community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he added.
Thieves carry $26,750 while filling an automatic boxer in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy reported that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic boxer in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "he came running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of incidents involved.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change to Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A long time ago, in the West, 41-year-old, he had his nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, in which it is expected to present its new album, called Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the programme's author.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West early this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've been through Kanye, which means the only one, just yes, that it's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has known him with various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, has been worth its nickname with or without script and in capitals.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use the military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obador, has promised never to use the military force against civilians, when the country lacks little time to complete the 50th anniversary of a severe reprisal against students.
Lopez Obador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obador, who has been committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the arrest and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should duplicate the funds allocated to the IA
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money that is devoted to research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several North American Government members have announced IA action, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in IA in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 of the world in terms of innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicate the budget for IA research would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the United States and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the IA field," Lee pointed out.
"Duplicate funding could duplicate the opportunities for the US to facilitate the next major discovery in IA," Lee told CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an I.A. system that surpassed Othello's American player with the best classification and then exercised as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively evaluated previous technology competitions from the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"In the wake, North American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university graduates to work in the IA field.
Lee commented that the work of the US in the area of the IA could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its recent-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other US public agencies give money to researchers in the North American world, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre designed to involve industrial industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than 100 million US dollars are currently being spent each year in IA research.
In the meantime, months ago, no measures were applied in relation to the North American legislation that he intended to set up a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed with Greece for decades, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has vetted its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most slave populations in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign questioned whether he would arrive at the minimum necessary participation of 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The question mentioned in the referendum paper is "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The participants in the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to secure Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that they will make the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularity had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered persons voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for Macedonia's referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov explained.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO integration will be accompanied by more investment than you would need in Macedonia, which has a rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev showed that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of the survey are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote 'yes'.
Because the referendum is valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the pro-Western government's policy since it took over the month of May last year.
Look at the video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, takes a shot after flying the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine predecessor received a passage through the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He left at speed between three Brighton defenses, dragging out with what he was going through the field of play.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four green scarves.
He gave up a defense before he passed over a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he took a walk to his left that he found Sterling.
The English front turned the pilot back to the first touch, inside the area, in Aguero, which with the right leg hit the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a right-hand right-hand right-hand spot that stuck inside the network.
"Aguero has trouble standing," Pep Guardiola, City coach, told reporters.
"We have decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that I have marked a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the struggle for the First League.
His goal came in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguero got the pilot deep in Brighton's field and
made a beautiful passage into space on the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before passing it to Sterling in the long suit.
Sky Blues' front end the pilot inside the network before he leaves the background line.
The city faces on Tuesday at Hoffenheim as part of the group phase of the Champions League at 18:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the game-off struggle, there were no many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, expects to go out to the launcher's mount on Sunday that he comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain an advantage party on Los Angeles Dodgers in the West League, have the opportunity to play the play-off.
The Rockies made sure a comedy with the 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can get out of here knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launch for Sunday, but they're apparently determined to let Scherzer slow down if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, took a hot session on Thursday and launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in half of the elections.
"All we've done is in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I don't present myself, but actually I do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They're determined to regain power for all the means they need, see their mechanics, their evil intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, about who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The democratic mission, he said, is "to resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he retorted, and titled the democracies of "stupid, ugly, dirty and false".
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, as it provoked a strong crowd.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... that was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, they are similar issues in respect of which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham Labour Party Friday meeting, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and long ago the promise of "most generous and kind" politicians has been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom he had previously thought that he shared a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180th and take positions that I would never have adopted, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central politics are being denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be the Labor Party.
And that's not just me.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, since the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't fall apart.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that different party, and with each motion of "untrusted" or each change in the selection rules, the party was more inclined.
In the last two years, I have received many advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not so expressive and "everything would be fine".
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by thatcher's negligent government, who left my whole class literally buried, I've tried to defend a better public service for those who need it, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have any doubt about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the Friday movement, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to deliver did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are laborers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my opinion, in behalf of the interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: A Father Impbatts the Leader
Two last-hour trials distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs won the victory in this vibrant game of Tenning's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only intruded team of ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew to take better advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still being beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Glorified for the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the best opportunities we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noticed an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded the Ayrs' advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, he noticed and converted a trial to put the marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, which he withdrew into a letter, and the Ayrs resumed the extension of the distance with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, the full captain Blair Macpherson was shown with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of intense pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a pilot-free landing in Climo, from the sanctions arrangement, MacPherson noted a counter-suppression behind the flying mill of the Ayrs.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again since the repression, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong fair and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to note the fifth trial of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move to the hospitality sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, interprets the character of the BBC's popular series, which he writes and co-portagonizes with Greg Hemhill, his comic couple for a long time.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "florent restoration sector" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without coast, expects the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The marines patrol for their ship's covert landing in La Paz.
Public buildings celebrate a sea blue flag.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are jammed with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Around the borderless territory of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, wait with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution in large screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will issue in support of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a surpassing exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, facing a controversial battle for the election next year, also has many hopes deposited in the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations have been submitted, indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from seeing you out, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has undermined the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrimination, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Ri talked to the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it appears that the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume nuclear diplomacy stopped more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a chimera to think that the continued sanctions and the US' objection to a declaration that could end the Korean War can make North Korea never get sidetracked.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make any major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and North American President Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is generalized skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang seriously takes the issue of abandoning an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion parades reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravaganced decks of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which highlighted the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been seen crawling through very few practical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the passageway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated bee hat, decorated with a wide wing, with a plum shape, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other top-sized accessories, there were jaundice syndromes, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafollar masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of live colors, had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not high ribs.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a cone of ice was.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge bars could be placed in the main streets near you.
Large-scale hats are smashing the tops of the Bomb, a ball hat, with a two-foot wide coat that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the roof so little practical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in bathrobes that it wore.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, decorated with raffia locks and finished with a white leather nose, was the outstanding piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in Paris' Fashion Week.
The famous stylisticist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large decks and beach bags in the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a service of the best level to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for future and higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable matter of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak it in your own language, you will reach your heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students received a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election assignment, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that for reasons given by employers to cover their vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more opportunities for potential jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with permanent competence like this.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for children today.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools about the languages they learn.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important to the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your son's interest, he will always be able to choose between a number of languages in independent schools, which include teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to be successful, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global trading environment of the present time, language cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron will begin with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Hope has practically ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you'll play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the lakers' official location.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the initial training this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of the Lakers' six pre-season games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he exclaimed.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings for the next week, including visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump expects support for the next mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today's 19th, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online in the link specified below, via video live via YouTube.
Trump is probably discontinuing the hearing initiated this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was touched by the charges of sexual abuse he is facing, while the Senate's proposed confirmation vote is pending until one week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans present in the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are directed to "stimulate volunteers and fellow citizens, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading towards a busy campaign season," said a spokesman from Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
The meeting tonight, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather "Ohio and Pennsylvania fellows, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows their ambition to keep the hope alive in the face of individual Sunday parties
After three unequal sessions, the Saturday afternoon forums were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculent pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive rat," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and has many reasons to be animated, largely by the state-like state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both count with three points of four.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and is giving an example.
The Gutular Celebration screams lifted up as he continued his turn and stood a crucial cock to embalmed the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the shit that made them win the party in hole 15 with a similar scream, indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to make the most of it and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to leave the print.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four or four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last new holes Friday morning.
As a result, and the way its energy seems to flow to and from public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that it is the players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is placed on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different times in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's furballs, who had married Alex Noren.
A crazy and two doubles in the first nine holes threw Spanish and Swiss into a hole where they never had a choice to get out.
Sunday, but there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are very fascinating to see through the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe at the end of Ryder Cup with a 10-6 marker
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after ending the fourballs and Saturday forums with a win for 10-6 over the United States.
The two-shaped inspiration by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, until now, in four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophies that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a little American team in the morning's four-balls and put the series in 3-1.
The US presented more resistance to the fursoms and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points at the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a weekend of sensational, are only the second couple who win four points in their first four parties in Ryder Cup's history.
After whacking Woods and Patrick Reed at the fourballs, they staged a brilliant performance to beat a woodslide and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic geniuses, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourballs, remarried with Henrik Stenson's foursomes and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point on Saturday for the Americans getting two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and, later, they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 at the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's story a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Fury's team, a title defender, just needs to empatriate to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a contract Sunday is coming out of its range.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed if trust signs are not appreciated
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying his confidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missiles, disarming the nuclear testing centre and commiting itself not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response in the US consensus," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
If well, Ri resumed the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-stage denuclearization approach that would reward North Korea as it gradually took action, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization of full, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement that Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearisation must be done first and that the level of pressure with sanctions is increased to achieve its objective in a coercive way, in addition to opposed to the "war's final declaration," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel down is a cinema of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our confidence."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the question of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Evil Trump titled Kim Rocket Man on a suicide mission.
Together with the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but demonstrated that there is still much left to do and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm complete and definitive denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut the funding of the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own requests for a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consonance measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was seeking were the security measures that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
Now, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extensive, to study throughout the night, stimulated by the caffeine.
One scholar observed that students in the number or number of universities in the world are often disappointed with the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after talking about the impact the privacy of the sound had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, all of this, in my last year?'
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sound, which surprised me," The Telegraph reported.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after he learned that some students had severe sound deprivation during the week.
The course, from an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of the cafe and the light, about how sports performance affects the lack of sound, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer makes sound deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, as the privacy of the sound puts the brain in the process of initiation and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they have an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emit the electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the approximate rhythm and cause noise problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
The goal of Dolly Menga condemns Steven Gerrard's disarray team to a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston house that is supposed to be another ambushed outside.
The Ibrox team was trying to add their first victory to their home from the February 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team instigated the second defeat in Gerard in 18 games as a coach to leave their team on the draw, at 8 points of the Hearts, unparalleled leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the marker.
While Rangers are now falling in the sixth place, Livingstone is in the third position, behind the Hibernian as opposed to goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently dropped out of the grace.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that pushed the Ayrs into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headlines that he launched a point against the Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingstone created more danger when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have been marked in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the campaigner fell away and took advantage of the great occasion.
A miscarriage of Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only made a trial to the rear suit.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their final third game.
Alfredo Morelos really thought he should have had a penalty on the five-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only directed two judges to carry the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the head of Lassana Coulibally and the archer Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in 34 minutes could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't afford Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted on the pause to change Coulibally for Ryan Kent, and the change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a transition to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to get the visitors' attention playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgov and Halket making long walks, one behind the other.
Holt's band could have moved the direction in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a fair turn from the corn.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
Almanac: the inventor of Count Geiger
And now a page of the Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave place to the device we know as "Geiger counter."
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which is played by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly weak-looking vacquer.
Man: "What's this inside?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger accountant, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from radioactive activity on minerals."
Evans: "Surely he's breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then reinject it.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovary cancer that she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (U.S.): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "enhances the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus is on removing the patient's immune cells and "teaching" these cells as treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got stuck in a pro-Trump diatraphy with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was enrolled in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented in the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, wearing a hat from Make America Great Again, began criticizing the Democrats and repeating their support to Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star complained of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it didn't issue itself, comedian Chris Rock picked up the recording of West's disapproval on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that he was not treated well among the builders because of the roof he had.
"They threatened me among the builders.
They told me you didn't go out with that covered hat.
I'm being harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put on Superman's coat, so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the crowd's screams at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed ashamed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained in the publication: "The whole study remained completely mute."
West was taken as a replacement for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex of which, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the audience with the interpretation of song I Love it, dressed in Perrier's bottle.
West got the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being among the multititude."
But the presenter of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (including his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "to be known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before he was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince's music changed his name for a symbol and, later, the artist known earlier as Prince.
Probation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the arrest of a man Friday in East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the court of Belfast's first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will check the charges.
The Throne Game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent Jon Snow's rescue paper in the series of violent medieval fantasies of HBO Thrones Game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the virile hero stereotype, claiming that these papers suggest that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently married the co-portagonist of the Throne Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she is very determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," she says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity through its very virile characters.
He added, "What is innate and what is acquired?
What does it teach on television and the streets that young boys feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's definitely something wrong with young boys.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel game of thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he is made of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play a position on the work of Sam Shepard's True West, which explains the story of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know her partner Rose is the best game she's ever had.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose was making Ygritte's paper, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represented in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 were declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people fighting HIV for this cause has been reduced almost to zero, according to Chinese health agents' statements at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality broke out in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT community is common.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from senators of the Republican Party and disarms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US senators on Wikipedia's legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that they were driven by criticism and extreme right-wing websites.
"Little lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," Waters stated in a Twitter statement.
Apparently, the information published contained addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday and published it to someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse complaints against the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that revealed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol said.
"This statement without foundation is completely false and a pure lie," the Waters went on.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which has been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the press secretary of the White House, Ari Flescher.
"This denial is full of indignation," Flescher wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accused's motives.
It has to keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics accused of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was present to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions they have taken and that they have damaged all and every member of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It's a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of the frankness of Johnny English's comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, it's not an exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how we're deplorable is going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the out-of-eye incompetent and face-to-face Johnny English has been able to renew its license for the second time to sell it all. Its name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the 2012 London Olympic Games opening ceremony.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson, who represented the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he seemed like chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last J.E. trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the sheets of the helicopter were repeating them in the helmet.
There's the gift Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but the humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematographic brands like 007 and Mission Nei now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children more than not adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeated assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the consternation of the service agent, a sadly small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and thirsty figure, who already suffers a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her own with this rocked character from Teresa-May, but the script does not reach any more.
Their intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy is in danger, it will have to recover some retirement.
And this includes the illustrative Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but apart from extra-official classes about how to be covered, with some good gags, like now when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequential sufferer Bough, a paper that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, linked to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste of time.
Thus, Batman and Robin, when things get very light in the secret service of His Majesty, they come in action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the charm of the technological charismatic billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sad Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous madness: decorated with rooms, set on a French fast food restaurant, sow the chaos by countering on the Volta luxury iota and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise present, everything seems to be a child program.
It's pretty normal.
Like the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's the idea of a plan for British people to have a four-day work week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
The party, of course, wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by giving them a more festive day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the economic agenda of the parties and plans to push the country for workers.
The change in one week works for four days with the support of the trade union union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labor Party stated to The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be night or day, but a four-day work week is a ambition that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspirations jointly at present.
According to a spokesman of the Labor Party: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The minister in the shadow of John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadows also imply that water companies' shareholders could not recover the entire investment, as the labor manager could apply "deductions" for the crimes he perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers in the company's joint ventures and create property funds included to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect to raise annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, explains in "60 minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Speak seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What's the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which provides an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In today's seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty through the increase in the number of people helping to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (but someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the purpose of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now spent 12 years in reaching its goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just another case of what we call "clitivism" (people who think it marks the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped achieve several objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37,000 million, which would have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and adverts derived from its actions, of which at least USD 10,000 million have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that at the moment, protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send 35 million USD to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a little bit of history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F's websites that asked you, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and hard way, sometimes we fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights defence movements and the previous apartheid, we will triumph, because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will take part in the upcoming event in New York, presenting Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports (secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary", resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern bank of Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is self-defined as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to stimulate the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officers, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "inadequate" project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "captive" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the capacity of the pipeline by 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the United States to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would "think carefully" his presidential candidacy in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to handle high responsibilities," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said that "he was bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed it should not be submitted for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator should not appear, according to Suffolk Political Research Center/Boston Globe's survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats that took into account a possible bid for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision to the genre, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TETPT Track Palin's affection at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being listed on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families that suffer branching from TEPT and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," explained to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans, "they're getting a little different, they're getting tired, they're wondering if there's respect for what their soldiers and pilots, as well as any other members of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and the number of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, you were taken to the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum for victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district introduced a friend to Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request for the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but the North American officers refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States are generated, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy called for a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The general prosecutor of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be granted according to the facts and particular circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend care.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policies that deny immigrants entry harm the economy of the United States, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, the general prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Assil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their announcement of June 11.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the worst, people face every day around the world.
Experiencing rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprinkling to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
Drinking water is missing."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed houses to take possession of the flood and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, ill-fated by magnitude 7.5, are satisfied.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke the shoulder, are out of Palu's military hospital, since the patients are being treated outside because of the strong bags that are being repeated.
The tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris explained to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the town.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with "advertising announcements".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of immigrating to the U.S. Congress on 6 November, charged that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to implicate itself in the U.S. elections marked what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to include ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen the oranges put together in mutual imports.
China's vengeful oranges at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to punish state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trump Party, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by the publication of advertising ads to our free press."
"In publishing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to include a payment ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In return, in the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few dissuasive voices and you will not see any real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
The Republicans leave women's voters before the mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, the analysts warn
As many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various sexual assault applications, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the next mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already officially shown that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure (R-Arizona) to complete an FBI investigation is enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they appeared in the Senate's lobby while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the chart," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news station.
"People say they've been tall already; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of neighbouring women and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before the Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault applications to the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accused, it's also about how the Republicans managed this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats, in the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided among those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance that is slightly resting towards the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the surveys believe in the evidence of Ford in an unquestionable or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an unquestionable or probable Kavanaugh way.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubted during his testimony, while about 30 percent claimed the same ford.
After the Flake pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught the genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source solid platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the company emerging.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own personal data store or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What's exclusive of the personal data store is that the user is who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personally powerful through the data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's consultant, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills because the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said none of his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Cross Victory of the GM
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in their home city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant Bernard Vann got the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons evicted a memorial bat in a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the blade was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's proselyte.
According to The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann headed his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick noise and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he made the line move before he threw himself over a cannon with one hand and left three totonites in the parade.
Lieutenant Colonel was beaten by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a proselyte that could never equalize, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead of them.
Imagine that you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're told to see the most important event.
San José's cartel contained 13 matches, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the United Kingdom audiences stayed at the scene when the program changed Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed that they had spent the night awake until the morning to see the battle.
A Twitter follow-up described the change in animated drawings as "a sort of vomitic acid."
"The rules of the government say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pick the cocoon, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include the UK spectators in the future.
"I think that when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were many messages that went and came, and they weren't all nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown lower than the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
At Desert Island Radio 4 Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father was important to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to get sick.
Daley, who appeared as a naufrag at Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's trifle explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the North American realist Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 grander than he did, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are young, it is hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced high and low levels of cancer when he was 14 and his father died of cancer.
The couple were married to a child who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me that last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether he had the income for London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you, 'stop, you won't be there to take care of the first row," he said.
"While he held his hand, he stopped breathing and was not even then, he was already dead, which I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud of Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and was still wearing his chicken skin.
Desert Island Disks is sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mikkelson introduced himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday
North American Phil Mickelson will record on Sundays playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unhappy match.
Mikkelson, who will participate in the biennial event to record for 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as usual for the United States, the five-star winner shares his time between making an encouragement and working in his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He never made the most direct drivers, not even at the time of his career alluded to, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult route, where the long rough custom is to punish the deviated times.
And if his own route isn't sufficiently disappointing, Mikkelson, in the new match Sunday, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined the rokie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, start strong, the Mikkelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a thumb on my back and surrounded me with his arm while he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a famous hall and it's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games.
It could mean the end of a race at Ryder Cup that didn't equal his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 empathies, although Fury has said that his presence has brought countless to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he's a joke, he likes to joke about people and he's a big teammate," she explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun with him this week, which was fun to see.
It brings much more besides your game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage on the American team, but eventually they won the victory for at least 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the crew members that have not yet finished.
You have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points can't reach the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said that, I've focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have the idea who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Charming the performance of its players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I'll never rush this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when it's all right, but the individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to render better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who sum up three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the top of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start with a good start, as seen in Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the fight against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the remaining Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his choice for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, repositioned
The new German Army fracture would have ended in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year it comes from defective systems and an increase in costs, according to local media.
The completion of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-building problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bucs missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use new traps up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuing delays imply that the forward-looking ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fracture was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss district of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once released.
There are few details of the reasons why he came back, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inaccessible if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, because it reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as many class ships as used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is believed that some surprising EUR 3,100 million ($3,600 million) has arrived from an initial budget of EUR 2,200 million.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if the recent warnings indicate that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, has acknowledged that the Army "is missing ships that can be used".
The officer said that the situation had worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but they were not provided again as replacements.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg fractures could join the Army.
The National Foundation spys on the secret life of the victims
A new investigation carried out at a site in the highlands of Scotland is about to discover how the rats use the landscape to feed themselves.
Discovery is expected to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern and water currents in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders were placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the hits during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the hits and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habit will be created to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show what areas of the habit are most important to the rat population and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of plates, and how to improve forest maintenance for ratites and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has fallen considerably in the last century.
Building and building restoration tasks threaten the hits, as they affect the snow and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning turbines are also at risk, as are the matamosic paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, the rats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
He's got ten experts with the right training, who do polls, zero inspections and, sometimes, usually rescued.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to the Thrave Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scotland.
The boss's administrator, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Treve, we have a large area for the hits," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habit.
But we still don't know many aspects of the hits, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking whether there has been a hit on the maintenance of property, as the possible involuntary destruction of one single motherhood nest kills more than 400 women and young people, because it could lead to the disappearance of all a local population.
Rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, torture them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Trust Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has pointed out that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "will become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will ask for the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, who is responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's predecessor and Juventus have been accused of violating a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375.000 at the time because the incident was not made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video from Instagram Live that addressed its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time gold pilot winner in the camera.
"They want to be famous for my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the claim against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have qualified as "inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral duties for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an analogous manner, according to reports filed by the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except for "1%".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of the injuries at the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she had "a fear of reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she seeks to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he fixed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would always regret it", if you lost world leader in the manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota's base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Getting out of the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider as risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just in time" basis, with pieces reaching every 37 minutes of UK suppliers and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom emerges from the European Union without reaching agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a consequence.
Clark says the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "accompanied precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We have to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, it has warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of United the Union on the ground, said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The hopeful Donald Trump meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "stopped for a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia and the aid to Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump's hired or not the Deputy Attorney General and risking Mueller's independence, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said "I prefer not" to congratulate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which led to a further delay in the Senate's vote.
Trump's press office, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It's not a date yet, it could be this week, although it may be a week later for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists might reject this claim: Sanders has not had any information sessions in the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfare of TV journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're fanfare."
Next, he indicated that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be enhanced.
"The president makes more sessions of questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me."
We often try to do so, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks, and you'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press rounds with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are not frequent.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some point, he is strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service to get out of fear for Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months from the EU's UK exit.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of residence requests for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on exit have continued, and still seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this late.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in case of a possible uncoordinated scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and disasters that strengthen and improve the health service task, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers re-reliner, has submitted to an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the sideline and went off there," said Reed.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a bed and taking it to do more testing.
A Tennessee State officer reported to Chris Harris, from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgeon at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris has added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it was planted from Illinois.
I've completed five Saturdays before leaving the game, which they make a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Hesenda expects to earn up to 120 million per year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will have a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more secure habitats that would affect the highest incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; these money will be destined for government action to combat the figures of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second dwellings and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
The new measure comes up weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the property prices high by quickly buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the assessments on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as control over the rental and termination of "no guilt".
He also wants to give more authority to the assemblies to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
But it can't be right that it's as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as it can for companies with them abroad, to buy habitats compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home in property is too far away and the indignity of homeless people makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, has said his "maximum ambition" is Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position at League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as support, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a kid and it's always a thing that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I have success in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's extraterrestrial claims that he does not feel pressure to be the next in a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley's bids and the Ipswich Town.
"Now, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the First League.
With the structure and installation of the club, it is clear that its place is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only think I'd been successful here if I could make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months of heart's technical body.
She helped Aloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren to fight for the rescue to champions of the Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the task of Alloa.
"I'd always thought training was what was given me better than playing.
It sounded strange because I did well, I got out reasonably, and I enjoyed enough good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, it's the more comfortable I've heard since I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired the consumption of bars with difficulties in Britain, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bars have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's financial assistant, the company that collected the data, states: "The continued hours of sun and England's participation in the world, which has increased more than expected, have made July a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, drinks sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from RSM hotel analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the foreign market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% interim would be particularly harmful, rather than constant cost pressure.
This long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving trades and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this necessary breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The sector's sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the sector's established benchmark.
One of every five children has secrets of social networks hiding their parents.
One out of every five children, some out of 11 years of age, has social media secrets that they hide to parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated an increase in the "False Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students claim to have a "main account" showing parents
One in five children, some in 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that cover adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "main" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager telling others to "violate me."
Research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "view of athletes" of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive
Elid Doyle has been appointed a non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field athlete and track player with more Scotland medals and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from their international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of athleticism in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot to do as athletes say, and I hope I can make the sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The statesman, who won gold at the 1996 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic gold and is currently a usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me whether I could recover or how much.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered from everything, I've learned to walk again and today it's about to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
An advertisement that compares mothers to cows divides opinion over the Internet
A shooting company has divided its opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are mixed together.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent arrowlet that can be carried from the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a musical video of jokes to show the freedom that gives the new arrowlet to the seas.
Four real mothers dance in a granary full of flour and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I move to myself, but you won't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not funny, they're my tits."
The return continues: "Bombage, bomb, baby food, bomb, bomb, girl mouth."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from whom it has been seen, many of which claim to show the "horror" of the legislative industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and stop to produce milk, with the difference that they are apart from their babies a few days after stopping," one person wrote.
Elvie's thyroid is discreetly hidden in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "I understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a tidal to mothers that they will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out-of-place ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "for fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to feed.
Bombing for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but you have to take what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who bomb with turtles (usually at their place of work or in the laundry and feel like they're cows.
It's not an advertisement to hire or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the shooters discreetly.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the trigger.
However, Elvie's thyroid is completely silent, it has no cable or tube and it discreetly fits into a nursing holder, which gives women more freedom to move, to subject babies and even to go out as they bomb.
Ana Balarin, a mother's first child's partner and developer, said: "Elvie's tyranny is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative campaign.
When we drew the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a thyroid is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new thyroid offers.
It's not the first time Elvie's shooter comes out in the news.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two children appeared in the hallway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased even though monthly entry across the border has remained virtually stable, in part because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to end up with.
Traditionally, most of the patrons were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the possible patterns and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenze, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"For 80% of the people who have taken or lived at the home of a person who has taken them are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albenz said.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear before the court within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports that they've been able to get to know the system in the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where they are more likely to be affected by the signs that a child is suffering.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say good-bye to their friends can cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mullem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for saving "unreasonable" refugees who want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to put an end to the war.
The US diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the last large rebel base, Idlib, has chosen the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that military action will take place in front of the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The staff of Mistura, sent by the United Nations, expects to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way to the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020, which, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, scandals and the process of dismissal end with his presidency in advance.
What would, of course, be "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum audience hours has doubled to CNN 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", by MSNBC, has led cable television audiences up to 3.5 million viewers in the main information nights.
"People have been beaten because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, an executive producer in the "Designed Survivor" series, on a cabinet decree that turns out to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"I replied that because I made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Bear", the construction leather jacket of $15,000 by Paul Manafort ("a piece of thick clothing like his pride", titled Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'm not going to see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the change of characters and tour of Trump's program (to fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-One).
You can't afford to lose an episode because you're behind you.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and I was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was closed looking at the MSNBC while he was recording the CNN.
He couldn't get out of here, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it looks like they were right."

Foreign money floods middle-legislative elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
There is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in actuality in the 17th Pennsylvania District, thanks to the realization of the congressional districts that have made two current members have to compete for the same place.
This recent redeployment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were reduced after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The course for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the party's main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a very successful special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates took out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions about the failure to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, head of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received US $140 million in 2017, was envisaged, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvement.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on issued visas, would be harmful to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths per murder and arrest.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from being directed to the United States.
But by the mid-September, high-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to be held, because it ended effectively with any probability of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration has given to it, according to the diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys turned discreetly to their duties in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions on the part of Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymous.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump in justice, of which there are many evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of the voters, and even in front of a party jury.
These are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall, or any of his European homonymists, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a stand against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on inflation points like this and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflation points.
What if Trump hired Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the research on Mueller?
Rosenstein has been watering his neck since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that it was not appropriate for the office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court even though the credible charges of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in mid-legislative terms for a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't go through these tests, democracy will start to run out of danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of Saturday on that table with chess.

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, optimistic of the race against the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers received the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive empathy in the Vila-Real field this month, would leave it in a good position to classify itself as the G Group of the League of Europe.
An injury in the knee prevented Mc Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the end of 2-2 against the Real Vila, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out at the end, but in general, it probably was a fair result.
They were better on the first part, but we were better on the second.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they brought a good result to the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it everything and get a good result with the support of the office.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine, and the boys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can do anything, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women lose sound for fear of saving for retirement
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Almost half of the surveys at the national level claim that they have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the survey says she talked to the kids.
"People want some family to take care of them, but don't dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate with your wishes in advance.
He works with your counselor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: It may also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term funding options can include a long-term insurance policy for long-term care, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut back on the legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the possibility of contracting a notary arrest for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget about the little details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Would you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Fired man several times with an Ilfracombe compressed airship
A man received several shots from a compressed airhead while he was back home after leaving for the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is in no danger to the wounded, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Since the communications are cut, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala region, an area in the north of Palu, near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following include some important data on Palu and Dongala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a region that extends over 300 km from the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, a region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but mainly in Morowali, on the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996 a tsunami occurred in west Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and is often caused by earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude struck southern Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude struck a pop-up zone in Padang, the capital of the West Sumatran province.

The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, born in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known man tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su's provisional detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured liability of $500, according to KTUU.
She appeared in the court on Saturday, when she was declared "not guilty, safely" when she was asked how she was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three Class A flaws, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B deficiency, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time any criminal charges are filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of Alaska's vet court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife declared that she had given a blow to her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service to Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes Friday.
The magnitude 7,5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work and expect the number of deaths to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just on the Central Celebes coast, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulated at the time of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The New York federal prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that hasn't applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to put an attack on a bike car from the West Side Highway, down Manhattan, and to blow up passengers and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intentional notice of the death penalty presented to the South New York District.
Both criminals could be subject to a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-carriage indictment that included eight counts of murder for organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable "planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and derogatory".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District brought a death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to carrying out spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to bring the attack to an end after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of 22 counts of charge.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a permanent chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said that politicians must " feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of their own members in Theresa May's parliament has suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative unmanaged MP Peter Bone said at the start of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when the conservatives for the union presented themselves in another protest against the Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to maintain its Chequers compromise plan between the attacks of the Brexit partners, the Union and the EU partners.
The Allies insist that they can reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' compromise.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out,' he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must remove the Chequers compromise."
To clarify its opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed from mentality and wants to remain there is totally false."
Brexit's conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The Chequers compromise is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, is unpopular between our party and our activists, who are the people who come out in the street and get us to win a few elections.
Leave Chequers' engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that meeting politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the union partners marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small number of activists were shaking flags on the Brexit conservatives after the group was released this weekend.
The conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canadian agreement more, for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would consider presenting himself as a presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the centre of speculation on the possibility of covering Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with representatives with the format of an open meeting since Trump took over his assignment.
An assistant asked him if he intended to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge's police, La., announced on Saturday that a death suspect was arrested on Friday at LSU Wade Sims' basketball player's shot.
Baton Rouge's police department has announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video on Friday shooting and asked for collaboration to identify the man of the metrage.
Yes, 20 years old, he got a shot and died near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at the head that finally killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul commented Saturday to the media for 247 sports.
Wade tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to the East Baton Police Department in custody.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment Valteri Bottas stood before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel went into boxes before and left Hamilton running with the traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxes and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton went after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the free interior with the risk of getting out after a double move to defend the third horn.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he went in the seventh position on his 21st anniversary.
Next, he continued in a good position much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, moved to Kimi Raikkonen, and moved to fourth position.
Finally, he entered the boxes about 44, but he could not increase the pace at the next eight times, and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real gentleman they told me to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have an u-dos," said Hamilton.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a meeting Saturday to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate of sexual abuse to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "suffering, cruel and lying".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see angry, angry, cruel, and lying people," he said.
"When you look at communications and filterings and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Deanne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." He added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtering process of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential, and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the Saturday night's meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using statements for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who do evil, they have to turn around to have power and control," said the President, according to Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday in the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game from 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in four minutes, 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan again placed the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he reached the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he dies to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area, and there are many people trapped between the runes in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat at the terrible control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that the Batik flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died at the hospital later.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"That broke our heart," she added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number of deaths is increasing because there are still many bodies under the rubles and there are still many that could not be accessed," said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with an altitude of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and blankets.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimers have been taken away."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is working against clockwork to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still worsen."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", told the CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lacquer
The airline that operated a plane that was going to be anchored in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk's airport.
The authorities announced Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was stuck in the lacquer because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track up.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk through the waist water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to shout, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who had been working nearby to improve a mollusk also helped rescue with an inflatable ship to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sinked about 30 metres inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst consists of a night chronology that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of a man accused of burning live a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received information from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Telephone records indicated that it was only a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense intends to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be passed by the jury during the same day.

Another black person?!
NY wizard asks a couple for a reward after a "racist" message
A New York mayor has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed condolences to see that the new mayor, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOE A OTHER NEGRA Person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing of her piphia, a "comfort" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman praised Mrs. Maurice, saying that the mayor who had awarded her, who was African-American, had done her work badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims to the couple a compensation for the compensation and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD a day for the work with six months' residence for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," she told the Friday post, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racist, claiming that Maurice's revenge was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been crying with, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," the investor added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors were afraid that readers would not identify themselves with a voice speaking, according to a new card.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in someone's place that was the first time before his publication.
It turns out very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small pelvic bone, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "aggression", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and the office that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a suspicious man," he said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as when your son got something: you're proud, even if it's not your thing.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognize his own reputation as Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter in haste to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I went a call from Nad and told me that I would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they gave her to keep beating her body were consuming and getting out of her system.
He had died before he was supposed to, and that's how everything turned out.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation involving relatives and more people.
I had to keep the right shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut, and tears did not stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her so much."
Grief women catch cards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, she was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chief with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was at a very dark point.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can come to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said that he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their presents and he looked them in the eyes and nothing."
He said his death would be a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future gets caught up in a row while the FBI launches an investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (a research with an area and a limited time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be destroyed by the death point of the participants.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his partners republish an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, the Republicans do not achieve good results, they will be weakened by the time they get the man who wants to get elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to pick up Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since it was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at present there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to cancel the strike and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean "cau" deserters with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 deserts occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed to work in general terms to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress ever since.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Nancy Pelosi House said that the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temper is unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival, held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that it was a "histories," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excitedly, denied the charges of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes shouting and without words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats and said the charges against him were a "gross murder and coordinated by a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's witness showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, since he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed repetitiveness when they asked him if he was trying to challenge the Kavanaugh election, if he confirmed himself, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, you're not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v Wade case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he asked questions as to whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and hope that he seems wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their powers.
It's a justified diatraphy: months and years of plenty of anger and can't take it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a little common.
She went on... "I helped a woman who was an executive somewhere who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, telling the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I went on.
It seemed bright to me."
Lamentations are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a masculine office, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable anger, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always frightened me a little) who took me from the clutter and dragged me to the eye of the scale.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramatrimonial adventure in a boat called Monkey Business and he withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," he told me while he was reigning 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "Blancan you and seven kids."
Since it was late for the campaign, I was late with the fundraiser, so he promised I wouldn't join the race if I didn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his partners, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give her 250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so excited by the emotions (thank you for the people who helped him, the frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and for guiding the voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and the anger, and sexism) that he was left without words.
"You might have thought you had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning in early this year when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new oranges affecting products worth US$200,000 million, and these oranges assume a tax on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has been under attack every time in the same way, and recently it has raised the oranges from five to ten percent to $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicate the US and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be back in the near future.
To make Washington go back, he has to give in to some demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European ground and have not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the water out into the hole of 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined on all his series and became one of the four players who won the 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated by 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European choice Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-year-old knight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't feel like crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad I recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia excited after the European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost the four parties he had in France and now he has a career record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the best players that existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklus.
The North American election fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's frustrating performance, "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning has been a moment when we have pressured the European elections.
We fought.
I'll get my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's to get your hat out.
He's defeated us."
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction of red tide concentrations in certain parts of Tampa's bay area.
According to the FWC, more widespread proliferation conditions are being reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting a lower concentration.
The spread of the red tide extends about 200 km from the north of Pinellas in the south of Lee.
You can find dots 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough, but in less places, compared to last week's situation.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
Average coastal or coastal concentrations have been reported in the Pinellas county over the past week, high-level coastal concentrations in the Hillsborough county, bottom or high levels in the Manatee county, mean-based concentrations in the Charlotte county, high-cost or remote bottom concentrations in the Lee county and low-level concentrations in the Collier county.
Respiratory irritations are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported during the last week in northeastern Florida.
