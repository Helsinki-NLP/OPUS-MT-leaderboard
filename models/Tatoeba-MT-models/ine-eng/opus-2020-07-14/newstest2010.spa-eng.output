Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. President of history.
Diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time it will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected it between 172 people and 33 organizations.
The Presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that when it receives the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this subject, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
In the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a better attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, to have the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the accused nature of blackmail
The police of Lithuania accused of blackmailing the president of the civil association Society of Nature Protectors of Lithuania (Sociedad de Defensores de la naturaleza Litomérice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded the money investors for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litomeřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Society of Defensors of the Nature of Lithuania is Lubomir Studnička.
Currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and containers can be found in the villages of southern Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
Allise takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash for nothing.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally delayed in the separation of wastes, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for these wastes.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské naměstí square, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the trash.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vagance
What happens is that the containers are far away.
Don't surprise me.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic to the trash.
But on the Kaunicova Street, I didn't see any red containers near.
Fortunately, I found the right place on the ferry.
However, the trash was already empty from the container.
Still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, is it not?!
What is happening is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extralige, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after a bit of Internet browsing, with official statistics.
According to ECO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire region of Jihomoravský region.
The "Parubek" budget took money from the income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the Government's opinion, funds are added to farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed an increase on some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenditures, incomes or disease subsidies. "This is meant only to delay the problems for the future, it is to put mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when money is taken, interest needs to be paid more and more and more, and one day, money needs to be returned.
The State has not many options to make money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating costs of the State, taxes must be increased.
To all who added the left now: the bombers, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also to your children.
People don't have to worry about the income or subsidies of the disease, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the coming year will not be left in the treasure only 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase along with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money in favour of some groups of voters, the next year will also lack five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
This is particularly true of the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or ending the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from ČEZ dividends, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, dividends are dealt with ecological damage, are used to complete the income account or are used as a reserve for the planned income reform.
Moreover, with this call, according to EU rules, the real deficit of the budget is increasing at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were made available from the budget for granting multiple compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or for the costs of disputes, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need those funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international fight, we might have to pay for it, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, take out the government budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions missing for the State Poland (State Fund) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started, and it should be allowed to monitor online what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Agriculture does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and there will be sanctions, caution Janota.
Your future smartphone can work with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can take two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company indicated in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its disposal.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries the hotelers
Not only do teleschiers in Krkonoshe worry about snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people don't reserve ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoshe you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but still are afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmas will be snow or mud," said the holder of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja, according to their expectations, should not doubt any more about booking the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotels offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they'll continue to offer them, but they'll soon surrender and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he loved Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we're more interested in is the naive week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some recent navigable stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sniežkou; last year it was harder.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's apartments are already occupied also at the hotel Omni, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Navidad half the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we found about 60 percent of the capacity for occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as snow falls, the interest in the stays in Krkonosh will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, hotel director Omni.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotels in Krkonoshe will be given the desire of the snow waiting.
The temperatures should fall on Thursday and, if there are precipitations, the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakobský of Hradec Králové, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
U.S.: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, waited anxiously, it was shown that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the speech "equal to in Iraq" used several times, but it also did not hesitate to use the title of the January 2007 Bush Declaration for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he had expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in charge of the Afghan General Stanley McCristal operation. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinated relations, subjected the indecisive firefighters in the White House to a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president went on for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he cheated on the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions about the answers he was offering.
Many doubt that the increase brings the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratriculated wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin. After him, tribal patriarchal relations will remain.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "action capable", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to collapse.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect statement of US defeat.
NATO's latest summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to search for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of the troops of Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the lack of three years for presidential elections and therefore there is still much time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank directors Goldman Sachs won't receive cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced that it would react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior directors will receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to undertake, mentioned the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has faced criticism after paragraph nearly $17 billion (approximately 30 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20,000 million.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive issue in politics, with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain announced the Wednesday it plans to record once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bank bonds that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all the least physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm by the hands of King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received it from two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his co-founder Jack Szkotak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical Nobel received it by Israeli Ada Jonathan and U.S. Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of the ribosomas.
The final award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was awarded by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is of up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In case there are several awards in each category, the award is divided by one another.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, that of peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of being awarded, since it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in some situations wars are essential for peace, even though their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Agriculture Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is on his stand in the government, because he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the office, is expected to be the topics of her meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the spokesman for President Radim Ochtat.
On his stay in the office, Janet wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals on the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they cover up the budget deficit.
Between the left-hand side and the government, Klaus and the right-hand side, there was a serious internal policy conflict. Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucrat office, which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, began to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, actually liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to stop public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians had long been depriving "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public farm.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Necza, told CZK that the concept of the bureaucrat office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly does not work anymore.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and qualified similar words of "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
The ČSSD Wednesday said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in the new movie by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, reports much about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonists play them as American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to be interpreted into Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy-two years, who received the prize for his role in the play of Eastwood on the world of the Millions Dollar Baby box, played the role of movement leader for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fiction president of the United States, and even of God in the Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to put an end to apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after the apartheid, his nation continues to be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through the sport, and that is why he decides to join the Rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role so that it would be as much as possible as the reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be among the founders before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to stretch his hand to Mandela.
I discovered that when I touched his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough world of Rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar in his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much higher in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invencible received positive reviews and is also talking about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the web page rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor on Resolute Norway: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded by recognizing yesterday that close to the borders with Norway had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of type "Bulva", previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this 13th trial, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the apparatus.
The engine probably broke out in the third phase of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulvá".
The Norwegians have not been vacillated since the first time that this was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained and the result would be in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately at the first stage.
Although none of the launches went through completely without errors, only six of the thirteen were managed by the Ministry of Defence.
The success of almost 50 per cent is optimistic for the generals and therefore continues to say that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even be able to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will again present himself at the age of 51 to a professional hockey meeting.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help your team CSK Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the duel of KHL against San Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and is currently chairing the CSK.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fatisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of the Russian hockey.
The legendary predecessor Gordie Howe played at the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The largest group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic gold, seven world championships, won the Cup of Canada and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Gloria Hall.
Hyundai has met the union requirements. He will cancel all additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely due to the frequent additional work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesperson for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the trade unions a further turn of Saturday.
We cannot postpone our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the Sedmiška.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way in which to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a day off on December 28, i.e., extend the Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees in the shifts on Saturday will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacture last week, the director decided to cancel all the extra work yesterday afternoon, Vaněk said.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two hours more in addition to shifts of eight hours, and this situation was virtually lost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory's management and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
The chief of the trade unions Petr Kucharj said on Wednesday, that if they commit to meeting the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that the employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of the emergency on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, which the past Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in some way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a reward of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Noshovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacture was launched last November.
Until last September, about 80,000 cars were manufactured; their current productive potential was 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance up to the 'acquired' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists provides evidence of new compounds capable of moderateing the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some available medicines already.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, the life of patients may be prolonged significantly by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely removed, the so-called resistant virus will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of the three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that the substances called metal carbrans have an effect on the albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metal carborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all medicines used today, and therefore they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, 'improved' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metal carbrans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedric cages made up of concrete, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A betrayer and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious body cells of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are combined by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV proteases was carried out in practice, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallic carboran on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the medicinal products that are clinically used, but do not lose its effect on the resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes it possible that metal carbourans are interesting components for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézačová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
He fights for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "expant" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it's time for the analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Necza said that the concept of the office office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously does not work anymore.
According to Necza, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Members he wants to support the minority, who is trying to combat the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in place with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Neča warned.
The House of Deputies adopted the 2010 budget yesterday, however with the proposed amendments on the left, for over 12 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the ODS proposals, as the budget deficits have increased dramatically.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS went out of the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the Government's wish, that the modified budget was better than a provisional budget.
Dissolved and useless
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of worthlessness; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would reassess the current situation.
He is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten the resignation if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota, he requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said, he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment in the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Neča in the government, they have nothing to do with the ČSSD appointments, which imposed the budget changes.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear whether he will resign, if the House adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to subsidies in sickness, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are free of blame
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, said Topolánek in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the deputy positions, there were people who belonged to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to postpone the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public farm, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-hand majority, which is currently in the House of Deputies".
However, it cannot count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about it, when the time comes, I'll take care of it, he told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went out in the afternoon to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS surrendered to the Prime Minister's request
He stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question, if ODS does not worry about the party's absence in parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
In the course of his resignation, he knew that in the following months he was mainly concerned with the Bolsheviks of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, he responded to Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will run at almost the same rates
České Dráhy (Czech Ferrocarriles) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two per cent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More opportunities for capital links will be won, for example, by the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, Dráhy for this line will add a pendolin career.
The direct train, on the other hand, won't go back to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains in Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains in Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line in Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nadraži station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
The account for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the year that comes with four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains will be charged by the regions, the year that comes will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains Drahy has a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been a year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only take place in one day's tickets - ČD Net and in the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For non-customer travellers the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will depend on the distance, so far there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to hold more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
The AFP agency thus stated, which previously only reported about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to wake up the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police had previously prosecuted the kidnappers for violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent murder, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the murder of 23 November, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film from Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech isInvictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of former President Nelson Mandela, South African Republic.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the protagonist role the Mandela himself.
The second paper, the legendary champion in Rugby Francoise Pienaar, interpreted Matt Damon.
With the stranger they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihahlah Mandela. Born on 18 July 1918 in Mveso, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world football championship are culminating in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the people by the ruling black majority.
According to AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "little interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the paper and prepared well to play it.
I often found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as it is said - collect his energy, mentioned in an interview after the strange party in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the film.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for many years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist also puts on the suit of the national South African team of rugby and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup at that time.
For entering the gregilla in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The football champion may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned Rugby Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, white South Africans are sceptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN a fan of Rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught up in the morning a transformer from the Čeps company in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesperson for the bombers in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the voice of the company, and it would not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandate, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity, nothing like it happened, the aberrations of this kind are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrichová, the voice of the ČEZ company for northern Czechia, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of the electricity substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps acted in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It retains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, and also maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Janchura will file a complaint for slander against three hetmanes from ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander against three social-democratic hetmanes.
This is the town of Michal Hasek de la region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubiký kraj and el hetman de Olomouký kraj Martin Tessarík.
Janchura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radio Journal.
The demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, completed long-term contracts with České Dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pastels of the pastel", yet we only bring the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České Dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České Dráhy, which were set last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's because of the slander against the Student Agency society, he said to Radiojournal Janchura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence in all regions; he said he had not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Haszek considers this complaint due to the continuation of Mr Janchura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmans who do it too.
I suppose that, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Janchura manipulates the public in the area of rail regional transport, and uses false and false arguments, Haszek said.
Janchura announced last week, which would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiojournal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the New Year.
He needed that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jancura launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České Dráhy to maintain regional railway links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Janchura, similar steps are in conflict with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Janchura claims to have been threatened by a member of the ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we could lose the bus licenses.
He was introduced as a member of ČSSD, I know what the gentleman is about, I'm not going to say his name, Janchura said today for Radiojournal.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine will end the usual habits from January.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already appeared that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumocococcals culminate.
The Medical Institute is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January you can receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge for children born from 2 August last year.
The condition is not even received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of the child's age.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed for the vaccination of younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year in vaccines.
Without breast-feeding, they will be saved in treatment, which is needed for children who are not vaccinated.
So far, the state has spent about 500 000 per year on the entire vaccination of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The neumocococ is the cause of moderate otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumonia infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die from hospital investigations.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neo-occocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, which this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, pointed out Rudolf Kalovsky, the head of the civil association Nahlas.
Your association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, where our partnership participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsky mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we do not think at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeně said.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The President of the Society of Pediatras The Expert Society of Practical Child Doctors, Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the Vaccuna volunaria has over the disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, they could be reasoned on reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that from the year that comes more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save after treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, paediatrics are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that paediatrics will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the so-called American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 frames in his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazzetta and other men used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Poconos Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency informed that 52-year-old Frazatta had told the police that her father had ordered her to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said Frazetta's father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the pre-budget report, in view of the criticism of the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "disappeared" an opportunity to show their seriousness about the cut of the deficit, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Hacienda also received strong criticisms for harming low and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Color for Social Security
The unions have regretted that low-paid workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRESSED EXPENDITURE CLOSES
Social security with an additional 0.5 per cent rise from April 2011
The economy will face more than the expected 4.75% this year
New tax of 50 % on banknote bonds
The increase of 1 point in corporation tax for small firms was rejected
Tax impairments for electric motors and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £3000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £4000 will lose £ 190, while a person who earns £ 10,000 per year will earn £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit by half for 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be above 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and delineated expenditure cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC told.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be paid and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be at 4.75 per cent this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5 per cent predicted in April, while the loan application would be £3 billion above the previously estimated figure.
"Unfortunate opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the loan application of £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would repay the money, adding, "cinically" to the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They have had the opportunity to do so and have wasted it."
"All important ads will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek to reduce the deficit in the shorter term.
But the liberal Democrats said that the money collected by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support the expenditures of next year, not to reduce deficits, arguing that the projects were like sand castles.
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies due to the inability of the next month of April, mentioned earlier, would leave the minister of Hacienda exposed to allegations of electoral maneuvers, as money could just be recovered next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the minister of Hacienda involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really putting the pain on for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," said Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are aware of this."
The FBI India on "US arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five U.S. suspects of extremist connections.
The US Embassy in Pakistan told BBC that men were detained in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the positions by which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed they are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the eyes of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
The Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on the arrests, informed the Reuters news agency; but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the continuing recruitment and training of the terrorist infrastructure".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuse"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as those of the Amnesty International Campaign.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had beaten him and burned him with cigarettes, another said they threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens murdered in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Tens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors state that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often beat me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-scientific.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
The Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that they had been abused.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was detained in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the abuse of the post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert Bristol's site of interest into a competition track.
The Pista in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It is seen under a beautiful view of the city's lights by title.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
Awards were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event of Thursday afternoon, the snow will be dropped.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested the construction of mines to be prohibited and there is a generalized warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's last work "Why the French don't like sails" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic space".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently secular issues, it maintains, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of whom, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
The conservatives question only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his counterparts in Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
To what extent are the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The World’s Most Desolating View
The Arctic is changing faster and dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is falling at an alarming speed, taking with you life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and the politics of the whale hunting, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence in the face of the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old catheter, fighting only with the end of his mosque, is probably a myth, but others are true.
The creatures, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly extinct mothers, were captured and sent to zoologists and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear living in Singapore has been greened by the algae growing within the areas without its fur.

Ellis uses reports from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to species survival.
Although it is banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorbikes firefighters use high-power assault rifles to throw their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about Arctic science and an overwhelming view of how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the rate of change.
It's not a lack of commitment.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the ice-cold movement that circulates below the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camping in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looked within the extraordinary, reduced world of the afluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater chorus that is compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on the wharfs of Arlington
The 19-year-old Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the National Cemetery of Arlington for decorating tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
Within a few months, from where we're sailing, we could be ourselves, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to put crowns on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morril Worcester, the owner of the Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year-old tradition, Morril and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way, to attend events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a military late career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm clothing, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers addressed older graves of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam war, because they do not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful while the children played and the couples were taking the hand, while they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red link attached to the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (association on behalf of the soldier) gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacier air.
Some read high-voice names carved on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who rubbed the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the shipyard Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, he said.
"Many after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a US contractor who distributed mobile and portable computers in the country, the State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works in client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained by almost anything that is considered "hazardy".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an early community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept awards on several occasions, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may likely cause tensions between the communist government of Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to get the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and codified products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government facility, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba is amongst the crimes of drug trafficking.
Berbena said he couldn't provide any more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly unresolved.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as sharing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the American Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the leader of the country, to replace his older brother Fidel's illness.
Vivanco said the accused were often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
It demonstrated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials set up a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, demonstrating that they hope the case can help to disarm an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet to search for radicalized young people.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymous due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said that men were not immutable and even trying to obtain the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda camps, when the Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, identify those who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda is paying particular attention to the American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those they admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has been transformed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on the streets demanding the negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, more bold action for the climate.
The demonstrators said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city holding English banners saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that said, "The Earth says "it's enough".
Several famous members joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's travels, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he manifested.
This is not an easy task, but you have to do, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who requested not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black actors placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest didn't seem to penetrate the conscience of key officials like Su Wei, China's climate chief negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the event was having a constructive impact on international discussions, he replied in English, "It was really not the time for the situation."
Then he went on in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and in different sectors on the subject of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that negotiations affect, or the freedom of others.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal book of qualifications last week on performance in mathematics was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best performance systems, the qualification book has shown that fourth and eighth grade students have slowed down at a faster pace over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the fourth grade white students in the D.C. for the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African American parents only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in performance actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained largely stable, reducing a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average score of the whites was not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
During a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference that separated the fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only decreased to 58.
Some District Education lawyers expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by looking at those on the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping out of joy for a difference of two or three points, the D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown said, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not spending either the time or the energy needed for our high schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the higher levels of primary and secondary school, who did not dominate the early reading grounds in their school courses and are considerably behind their parents.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to which he is credited some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of rough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies city testing scores.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
The objective can then generate political repercussions that go against that important timing.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban supervisors, she is trying to stick to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now Newark school overseer, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong rise.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, came down and paraded for a moment in front of the white columns, the façades of brick and the emerald plains.
Graciela's parents had only graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot in a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the score cost $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of potential enthusiastic students.
Yes! Here is where I will be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers-students at school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their trip for three days, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: the question is not whether you will go to university.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanic "second-generation" graduates is at university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university, especially if efforts are sustained in time.
Noting children of low income, whose parents have no experience and skills to help them navigate through the system, it turns out that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to the secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to implement university training programmes, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue to graduate from high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two sub-posts that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a key role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have moved away as they have only climbed in two of the 10 underlying deposits.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for deposits that were suspended in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asians and Europeans at head, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news center.
It'll be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by mass-coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while US military withdrawing, probably prevented US oil companies from risking themselves more vigorously in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of cruelty in the world, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases in disadvantages, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only US companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, which have narrowed ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been removed with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main meetings.
We know that China is about to become a major economic and technological power, the spokesman for the Assam jihad Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The pre-selected companies submitted proposals made offers that were then compared with the barrile subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each deposit.
The main planner of the Qaeda has been apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a major operations planner at Qaeda this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have fallen off Tuesday when a couple of missiles attacked their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said a civilian intelligence agency official from Pakistan, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner in Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy all over the world, said a high official who spoke from the anonymous, quoting the delicate nature of US air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had quickly climbed into Qaeda's ranks and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but it does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of non-pilot attacks conducted by the CIA has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to an account of The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while deliberately killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN Maximum Mission to Kabul to Refuse
The United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that had been damaged by widespread allegations of corruption in the UN-backed presidential election.
The Eide exit occurs when Obama has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the U.S. timing for the military withdrawal that began in 18 months moved other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian staff working with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not leaving, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials said they had been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who had recently headed the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who had previously directed United Nations peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested in front of his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was dismissed, "were certainly damaging the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also stimulated the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which are being provided to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase his confidence that his money was being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, insisting that the ambitious UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talents.
That is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and you can't keep going.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, due to his failure to engage in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent impossibility of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and incentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "crewable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear programme and accept to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have withdrawn from the attempt agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian mandate is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some of the proposals actually accepted in early October has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set the deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options are replanted, even to continue with what the Foreign Minister, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "destructive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations stated what Thursday called "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it had the will to continue discussions with the United States and other five world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that were sermons about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby but means a more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shangai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: in no way.
We've already given all our time and energy just for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang said, 31 years old, a human resource manager with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously rebellious children, the only abused children, affectionately captured "small emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when politics was effective, according to the Division.
The population of the United Nations, while the 60-year-old population is expected to grow from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1. per cent to 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very famous populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shangai's Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has demonstrated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly and reduce a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single child of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have underestimated the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural proportion of male and female.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually abandoned their position on the policy of a single child.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and woman are single children, and in 2007 many of their hardline slogans were reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly evening in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be ideal for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family and volunteer planning officers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointmentous Response
Although officials from a rural city outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications a month.
The disappointed Shangai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly more than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caoulu Municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they maintain that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly view single child policy as a question of rights, Yang said, an engineer of the construction whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, we're stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42-year-old owner of a translation agency, explained it more thoroughly.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is to be successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up fighting their parents during the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and did not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a long time from his parents, he did.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategy "must have a curriculum prepared for the best custody when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of life, he manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual reprisals, caught renewed attention on Friday with the publication of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiations that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Based on an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not mention how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, which include how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives you a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN climate chief Yvo de Boer described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also encouraged discussions on Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million annually over the next three years, to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday, the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated the conversations last week were introduced.
The United States' special climate mission, Todd Stern, rejected claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries, compared with those of the major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maniobra indicated that Obama's administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei said that the United States' largest climate negotiator lacked "common feeling", or was "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's main power at stake, failure lines have erupted both within the world on the way to development, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should cost the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in seeking to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate supported, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement at all.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, drew up a proposal for a preliminary 24-page treaty early on Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to be able to delimit the advertisements that will be arbitrationd during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the Convention Centre every day, the activists who touch the guitar present night shows of the countries they think are being sold, and preliminary hand-to-hand proposals are being made instead of via e-mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first 225 km train from Great Britain refines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a Silbit will drill the darkness to point out a train exit that marks a revolution for travels in Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km, when it passes as a beam from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurban Javelin service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the big conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The remote areas would become prosperous suburban, business travel times would be cut short and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still slow the high-speed lines of Great Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route from the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped setting, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or close to Birmingham, with a branch headed west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first plot, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a little more than a current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, converting to the British network in the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is designed to support trains of 400 m in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to adapt to the high-speed network.
The experts in the railway industry maintain that only St Pancras International or Euston provide this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
In the beginning, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines for the trains in northern Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for a $75.000 orange of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the singer of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "of rations", increased their mortgage in £75.000 to build an extension marked as a slave in their second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to load the additional interest, summing hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Läg, who conducts a review of the members' expenses. Mr. Duncan said last night that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, has a two-bedroom house in a town in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of honoraries agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a winterhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its earlier mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee dismissed him from violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of his ownership of London to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over £1,800 a month.
The type of interest of the mortgage of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland did not change at the time, suggesting that all the increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage type of the BRE fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March of this year, the type to which it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed it saying that the MPs had to survive "of rations" after the cost scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I like my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as a oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol of the sterling pound in Mr. Duncan's basket as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, both approved by the salary office and later by Legge."
He added: "It is not about avoiding and defiling or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Event of the Palace of Brighton Beach
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palate for every December, using Villanics as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with pastels filled and served for free.
The villas chosen so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant in Howe, is a non-remunerated clergyman of Chichester diocese and Beyond leader.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Event of the Palace began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday in an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were derailed by the Danish capital iceberg in a claim for an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to a very high "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents erupted shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black-dressed, broke out with adoquins and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturb police intervene quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them were "immobilized on the street on Saturday night, married and seated despite intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the great European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue marbles" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said the benefactor Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses that can walk as never before could be done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to the warming, gave the initial summit the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in most of their students, painted red garments and shining flags for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The separatist Abjasia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abjasia, a prorusa separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounced "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of Ossetia del Sur, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The electoral tables were closed at 17.00 GMT.
According to the heads of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the poll.
These elections are a farce.
On his side, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "promulgates that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abjasia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new being as an independent state, declared the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who addressed the electoral table in a school in the capital, Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with vast landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the development of the election.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, responded by raising his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as the one who gives Russia control of the railways that have been under 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50 per cent more is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched out in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
A few minutes after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke out with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbing police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, stating that it was mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandible with a douchebag, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to the police.
To the extremist groups, we did not take our eyes off the top, preventing police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the great cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, including Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue marbles" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.

The Oxfam organization together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to the warming, gave the initial summit the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red garments and lit flags with candles in favor of solar energy in front of the City of Philippine Capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The assignment of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelorship.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "just with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, it calls on the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be subordinates of the C, it continues to underline even: "I have neither heard that historians nor intellectuals were angry that they had eliminated the history and geography in the second bachelor's degree in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French people of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate mandatory history-geographical education in second bachelorery C. Many intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "not to be spoken" to eliminate the philosophy of the second batister programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they said sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will produce an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real terms during the year of M2, then be a first year in front of the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, i.e. more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal Higher School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Five minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that was accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Upper Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the "Ernest" conference wheel, a journey consisting of a series of presentations by experts of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and conveys their desire to know more, he explained at the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school barn.
We chose twenty participants among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," AFP said Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics against some 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific file".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a two-month pace.
Delay in payments: Disgusting between prison guards, action is planned
The prison guards' unions called Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, the prizes and extra hours, which was postponed to many budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guard Union) asked staff outside of service to join the event on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) invites them to "reunite in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", since the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, night premium, Sundays and festive days" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Office of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased much in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard trade unions to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
No doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate for Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation, generated by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours, did not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoys the benefit of the famous prizes for functions and purposes, and that "always blames budgetary demands," said Ufap/Unsa.
It is a true scandal, he said angry the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott to a new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking more effective action, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salary, the Burdeos prison CGT estimates.
According to the trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some have more luck than others.
But in any case, the result is not the expected one, said the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those who receive
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I have better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be of the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," he challenged the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During one hour's interview, in a relaxed environment with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts of the child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave it to Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Only many years later, I realized that he had given me that balloon.
On his side, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL says it's in the inducted coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to important "lasions" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its allies, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reinterpreted on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "derivative injuries from the operation" of discal hernia performed in Paris on 26 November, pointed out their press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, tried to convey peace by saying that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be reported within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the last singer's tour, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be submitted to a coma induced to avoid "pangs and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we'll have more certainty about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no channel would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park because of a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well-known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection caused by the intervention carried out by Delajaux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad moment", but he made sure that there was no "no problem" because the rocker was "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was foolish to do twelve hours after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the music producer Jean-Claude Camus intended to calm down saying that Johnny Hallyday, "responsibly responded to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days as a result of a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been exaggerated. Fanatics and journalists have noted the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their allies even had to derogate from a new hospital.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-star medalist in the worlds-2009 long pool, obtained an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particularly affected, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many were actually expected more.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, which codified the world record in 50 m free, brand that has in the long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queens of the swimming, 50 m free, the French 28-year-old was charged with 20'53 during a finish where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were eating polyurethane baths that were banned from January 1st.
These bathrobes, originating in 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epoch in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not reach its mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was charged with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, much above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art market.
This two-metre panel is 63 cm high, date from the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionisian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and Hebrew women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred batches.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest by the buyers, no doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernthy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was a acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bath in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marine Petin took power.
For some 50 years, his stand was uncertain.
Revising the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open Emile Zola "succession" in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted Zelaya's Exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico believed that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrowed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the Golpist government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the move, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, declared.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived on Wednesday to El Salvador to take to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to grant him a rescue, the Golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "relevant" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the State Chief of State in the invited exercise.
The golfing government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign myself (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday to Radio Globo, where it usually made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements with the deposed president, who has been refugees in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico presented us with a request for safety, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not contain asylum requests, the Interior Minister of the Golpist Government, Oscar Raúl Matute, said on Wednesday, on the HRN Honduran radio.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I go out of Honduras, I'll do it as the president of the Hungarian people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who met around the embassy of Brazil, strongly located by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Golpist government.
This reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day he organized a referendum to prepare his reelection, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes, he will be arrested and must answer to the Court for the crime of "high treason", according to the golfist government.
The President, Roberto Micheletti, actually managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the electoral controversy, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Zelaya to power until its mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, of a technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The extended standard & Poor's 500 index was 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza de FTN Financial said.
But this is anecdotetic, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle glass full".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States fell by 7.6 per cent in October from September to $32,900 million.
On the contrary, the analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of volumes of trade, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, over the past week, unemployment registrations in the United States had increased unexpectedly and 474,000 applications had been submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "was the lowest for a year ago", said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year treasury bonus performance rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on the evening.
Cuba: more than a hundred power supporters attack the "White Ladies"
This Jewish hundreds of Cuban power-partners spoke to the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the capital centre demanding the release of these detainees, a journalist of the AFP supported.
The Yankees died!, "Thank you!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raúl!" were coerced with the gun on the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were heard by civilian-dressed officers who came to "protect them."
On the evening, a similar event took place against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who were also about to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were harassed by government partyers, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded the 2005 Sajarov Prize by the European Parliament, had set up an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissidentity, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 follow the ranks.
The Cuban authorities charge the opponents of "merceners" or "agents" at the wages of their declared enemy, the United States.
In the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursday's government militants against the "contra-revolutionarys".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of paving the rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien killer to an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the afternoon's greatest fluency
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant would have beaten with two knives and for unspecified reasons, to an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of him at No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, reported police and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man who was born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a officer of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years of age, fell apart and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the apparently affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a disappointment and was hospitalized "in a state of shock", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the storm Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old, and another forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two carnivorous knives that had been crossed in the back, he explained in the place a union chief Alliance in the Altos del Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the stranger, according to the evidence obtained by the AFP.
I saw some kind of thirty-year-old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Alberto explained, the roommate of a nearby bar.
A crowd went up, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
At the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded at gunpoints, according to the police's testimony.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important injury in the abdomen, he told the AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
Nanterre's Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of the Senate (SDPJ 92).
The madness was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalizing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen were needed to dominate him in the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed by this kind of force which greatly increases under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the cause of his client, who is under domestic arrest in Switzerland, was dismissed by a case of sexual abuse more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer from the director of "El Pianista", denounced three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at the same time the charges are dismissed, since the judge's conduct in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was escalating".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has been dead since then) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before declaring a sentence, which is a serious procedural failure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), of the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed that a trial would allow him to present evidence of his argument if the court rejected the denial of the case.
The charge, on its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that there could be no serious assessment of the deestimation of the duties in both Roman Polanski and not before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was pronounced on "illegal sexual relations" with less than 13 years of age.
Ever since then, he has never walked back to the United States.
The district vice-fiscal of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear in the audience."
For this reason, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused people, that there is a possibility of fleeing, asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who was asking to dismiss the cause against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client no longer supports her every time the Polanski case is raised, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of United States arrest.
After more than two months after the riots, he was sentenced to a domestic prison in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses track and stops by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average raised 65.67 points reaching 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, of a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located in 2,190,31 points.
The extended standard & Poor's 500 advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blackxilver, from Marblehead Asset Management pointed out.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is becoming smaller and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's view on the strength of economic reactivation", analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, minority sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers was clearly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new advance of the dollar, which reached the highest level of the last two months in front of the euro, which "takes down the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
In this way, the technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year treasury bonus performance rose to 3,540 per cent against 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bonus to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on the evening.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates at Miss World's title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportist or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real alarm.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've lived countless experiences!," said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This nine-time event will be held in South Africa on a live Saturday from Midrand, to northern Johannesburg, starting at 17 a.m. (15 h GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very happy to have flown twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the possibility of discovering again "African countries that remove the encouragement".
After a month of galas, tests, press and safaris, candidates to Miss World focus on the contest.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
The dream of every woman is to be crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will take off with traditional clothes and, of course, with bathrobe.
The Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen, Michelle McLean, and a director of Miss Mundo's committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa has proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and hard pride to equalize, assures Julia Morley, president of the Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on a bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
As exceptional, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who stretched their hands.
Something less common for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
Your best memory will no doubt be the race in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 Football World, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've treated people I never thought I'd get to know.
He's probably back for the World 2010, says excitedly Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13th local (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, distanced, assured that he would move "as before" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation last November 26th in Paris.
The musician is "as induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered the Monday for an infection, a sequel to a discal hernia operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where she attended her daughter Jade, to attend a school event, he confirmed a photographer from the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitie-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November at the international private clinic in Monceau Park, Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "sent too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice as a Discal Hernia, he added.
Shortly before in the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have gone "without a canal, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajaux was working at that time.
In 2007, I also joined the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to re-absorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by mispractice, as well as by fiscal fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" demanded "on a regular basis" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajaux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's turn, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer, came into parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its seal
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the seal of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, his regret being demanded.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
As support for its management, it received the assistance of MP Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF Association office, controlled by friends from François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and to the MP, urging them to give up the seal and transfer the rights of the brand to them, their sentence of judicial action.
In these last days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to regain the UDF seal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan + the UDF today's+ on its militant material and on the page of presentation of its site, support the signatories of the letter.
As they already know, they have no right to use the sign, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to withdraw "the name of the UDF from all support, as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate owners".
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not have, according to them, any right to use the UDF seal.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continues the office, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but from the UMP.
Use scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to carry it out on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they complain, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to refer to artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt said, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to excavat it from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars in the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and €375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the laughs of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Tribunal No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87-year-old, be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's successor and principal shareholder has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they should state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and during what time period.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, she told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, when she left the audience.
The lawyer, Françoise Bettencourt- Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is a great news (...) The experience will show that he (Banier) manipulated this great woman, whom we must protect, said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for the sake of obtaining a billion euros in donations through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considered to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt- Meyers, the lawyers' allegations resulted, on occasion, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that he was unfaithful to the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Ever since his wedding, I've never been able to speak to Françoise again."
On the other hand, the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, as much as a guardian’s judge was denied, in these last days, to take place on his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No one else can appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt- Meyers would be delivered once.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that collaborators will adhere to certain "values" from above as it used to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By placing the customer at the company centre, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that do not relate to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demobilization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially I+D and, even more, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "needs all parties involved (...) to have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; this requires employees to make a commitment that is completely contrary to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire by Orange among his employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
"In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many times, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
"Finally, because most of the directors have a simpler view of human behavior.
As they come from the major engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that American "neutrosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread to their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executive's commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directors in a mechanical management position, which is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies is intended to adopt a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of making a reality part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifuncial Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a default dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, corporate directors can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and shift human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: by the "just war" Obama gets praise from the right
This Friday, the North American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, he called on Obama's speech on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on 9 October, this time praised the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice-president during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the US Today newspaper, and added that she himself had addressed the subject of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, since then, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he noticed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, and the former President of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the speech seemed very historical to me, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was shown to be pleased when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speech and current chronicler at Washington Post, Obama spoke "a very American speech".
In addition to being present as "citizen of the world", as "always does," he spoke as a US president when he reminded Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconfirmed right-wings, a Bush-era halon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the talk "Monoton, Pretentious and Lack of Inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
On the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed at seeing Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-wing press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing that Obama received the Nobel in advance, qualified his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "promulgated the speech that was needed," said the New York Times, judging it as "at the same time as shade and building".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure navigational supply
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and the Tlf (Transport and Logistics of France), the sole patron organization that remained until the end of the day came to an agreement on Friday afternoon that put an end to the strike signal and to the threat of navigational supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was “enjoyed” by the agreement, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at Friday's dawn with the hope of quickly signing the text in accordance with the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a doorway.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was established at 6 p.m.
The conflict "was very harmful to businesses" and "was feared to disturb the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (on local and regional road transport) and of 2.9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The rate per hour goes from €8.72 to €9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, Patrice Clos explained.
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there may always be some disparaging rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common agreement that respects the employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as a "historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the subject of an extraordinary payment and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft law on rectification finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to companies attached to this organization and, secondly, to all professions, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be "fastest," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "ingenious business", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not oppose those who wish to eat straw at the next Nochebuena dinner, Unostra was regretted.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, discontinuity unions with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP's management, there was no agreement and trade unions were not satisfied with their application.
For this important end of the week of nave purchases, the Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train of each two on the central track (between La Defense and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The connection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is trying to provide service to large shops".
The RER A cross from West to East the city of Paris.
The RATP plot runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one of each of the two trains circled in bridge hours, and almost no train in the valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday, there was no disturbance in the others thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less competitive than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station was not satisfied, SNCF indicated that it had planned the oversight of police and law enforcement.
The RERs that operate the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with destination came or were part of the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "unsatisfying" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its first proposals between parentheses, the CGT noted angry, saying that the management "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the working conditions of the profession", RATP specified.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "did not care about the end of the week".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which was denied even then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a warning.
The trade unions are asking for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premium, for hours with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which had just held a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to the 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society's party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unit," the President of the Court, Hasim Kilic, told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kilic indicated, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are members of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the Party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (from 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would abandon Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision arises as a result of a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and invites the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Tribunal takes place at the time when the Government holds a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders said that a resolution could generate a rise in tensions in the South-East Anatolium, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated in clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators have met in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the Southeast in its majority of Kurds.
The Forces of the Order threw tearstone grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or rocks with hogs.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Turkey stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen the discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, it declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of the parties.
That's how nothing's solved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can of course expect a PKK reaction, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowflakes can begin suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the Director of Road Maintenance in the winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
The end of the week may be announced by meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow professionally in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called "A" works with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the access to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and hangovers, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
It should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which will be better adhered to.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the hour begins."
The difficulty is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble is generated, you know Brauburger.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly at dangerous and cruise points.
In general, the ESF could not cover all bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight of the bridges, Brauburger comments.
As these become resbalades quickly, the salt vehicle is launched as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police may also call them.
The crown of the dinosaur
The Tawa found it had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong rear legs, had an extended head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with hook shape and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogical relations, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists launched a excavation in 2006 in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triásico sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the excavation course, the remaining five specimens were collected in total.
A find confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The fossils of the Triásico dinosaurio are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaurs don't share all this enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts debate, for example, when the soybeans were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivores thermopods among which are the Tyronasaurus Rex, the Velocyraptor and also the birds, the four-ruped soybeans known as the "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivorouss (satures with avian furs), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa is a primitive therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa skull the researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also possess the offspring of the therapists, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the thermopod with older and primitive airbags, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the parent line of the later giant saropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers claim that the rats came there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines were separated at one start and extended from South America by all the corners of the Earth, which then still formed a single Earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found the remains of two other not closely related therapists together with Tawa.
The three cannot descend from a single parental precedent, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, commented Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still being preserved, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the evolution of the dinosaurs from a relatively rare parallel line of reptiles to the dominant earthly vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in Triásico the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the present cocodrils and the pterosaurians and with many others.
Towards the end of the Triásico, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the parentheses spread across the Triásico border to the Jurásico.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite slows the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triásico and since then had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, attend.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police release of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt affected the whole world.
278 teachers and academics from Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are co-sponsored with students in protest at the Campus of Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "reject" the police expulsion promoted by the Governing Council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, took the building occupied last week by students and teachers in an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and academics by a police command".
Disappointment represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and distracted the content.
The Governing Council has refused to engage in the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand immediate withdrawal from the court claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, they say.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade unions are also united with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, remarks the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the director of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the principal of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on a news release on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province's Parliament.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, Peter Beuth, a representative of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The view of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the student’s arguments and demands, they are being dismissed.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrod, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a site strongly guarded for the secret investigation of weapons.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important micro and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have been in contact with the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Strength Cooperation Protocol".
The Vice-Chairman of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selingrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt the head of planning services was Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the research centre of natural sciences will visit a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set a foot on the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the home of important Russian research companies and institutes.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not placed for anything high enough.
For the project's participants, it's simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law is sound. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will rush to the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region for a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, as a huge amount of time was needed in ancient times to trap the locomotives from the back.
Rotate, stop in the dry, continue the journey; but that's how it should be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step-by-step station, which is about half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there the slogan of "Europe's Heart".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the 80s' visions are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impassable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have so agreed.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the contributor and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, provided by many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The step-by-step station and road support are intended for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first take care of strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally than road vehicles.
However, the new construction works are good for freight trains because of the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavs.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing on other narrow crossings and crossings on the network.
In total, 60 major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of over 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the track has been constructed slowly.
It would be urgent here to walk the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The shape of the Rhine Valley will be the bottle neck for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government remains pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it is to submit an appeal to the case concerning the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH's judgment on more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had established in writing at this date that in the case of the construction of the northwest runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federation would have to re-rule the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is to submit the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticised this postergation and pressured the government's representatives to resign the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of banning night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We are fulfilling our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recruitment, which the federal government would be attempting to obtain its night flights through law disturbances and tricks.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally inaccessible decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the claims of its group regarding the prohibition of night air traffic.
The US banks return the aid granted.
The large US banks that have been rocked by the crisis are stripped of their state assets.
The Bank of America once returned the aid it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately EUR 30,000 million).
The Citi Group also plans to return State aid, according to a report from the United States CNBC.
With this, the Institutes intend to exempt themselves from the restrictions that had gone out of their hands with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved about 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among other things, for the sale of rubber.
The bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked the U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday, especially on Wednesday: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank into the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to get rid of its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce this Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June, they had already returned their aid to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than he thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF's administrative council (German television channel) pressured the editorial chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the striker wanted to vote about the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the director of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not also be approved in the Administrative Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the band.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's resignation was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could have been expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the president of the government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He issued another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument that under Brender's direction the ZDF's information would have lost audience indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end of the debate, 35 experts in public law had become involved, which had qualified the Koch process as unconstitutional.
But it didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanic philology.
He later worked in the Southwest Funk station and in the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 it changed for the ZDF, in principle to the "day-to-day" information.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and manager of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after Brender's resignation, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Midium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Government of Renania-Palatinatedo, explained last week that the federations should change the State Convention of the ZDF in such a way that the Director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of party politicians from ZDF control belts was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the strike for the resignation of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter could appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote him, without falling under suspicion of giving him the post to a dry party.
In the calculation of the Frey parties, it is awarded in all ways to the liberals on the left.
University careers are getting rid of
Partly success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers for Education and Culture of the federations finally gave up. At a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in licensing and mastering cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, it was agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the race should end with a single review.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is desirable to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states commit to making the structural rules together more flexible for Bachelor and Master races.
Regulations of the federated states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less Examines
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and the directors of universities have been constantly talking about improving their ability to perform and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time, we talked about a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to dramatically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single review", says a 30-page document, which intends to regulate partially the adoption of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the Director of the Accreditation Board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, the "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined in relation to unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more space, enabling and encouraging their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be re-accredited every five years, but this would mean that it would take up to 2015 to examine all the races.
This would include 10 accreditation agencies across the country, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, established by the federations.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federations in October to influence agencies in this way, so that the number of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far, only Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means are provided for further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student education and counselling programmes, as well as strengthen examination and external offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring a novelty of university law to parliament.
According to it, there should be only one review for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Until the end of the year, it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and opposition discussed the conditions of study in the federation.
There were also criticisms of decisions among the praisers.
In the federal-level joint directive of the Juso university groups (socialist youth) it was necessary that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "three closed doors" by ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the strikes of education, students as the main stakeholders should be able to also consider.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to students: "We need students' experience," said Thursday at a meeting with the Education Ministers, with which HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough study places for Master in the future with the best possible study conditions. Thus a member of the GEW, Andreas Keller, informed him.
The federal states have to deal with a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Getting into and out of Germany is practically out of control," says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in disbalanced linguistic fragments, in which he thematicizes the experiences of getting to Germany experienced by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in Banat, Romania in 1951, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite well last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deconfigured mirror of his security files"
Apparently insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted his participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security against German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"That is why I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal to the Dictatorial Dominion Mechanisms, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that shows the abisms and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, therefore known so far, not only author, but also victim.
In his security file IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of the IM Walter.
I had apologized or defended him at all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Security-Spitzel gessen, Herta Müller wrote in July in the "Zit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved will certainly have speculated and would have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the seudonys of Sorin, Voic and Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of security control files is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of Security (CNSAS) relating to the Birthler authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is better on track.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, after awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former chief of the Security of Temesvar spoke disproportionally of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," at the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be displayed without a return in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise inevitable with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the anxieties of knowledge, not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a note to the foot.
The Champions League as a guarantee to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by a orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, giving the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed outdoor service was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of sports items would have distributed samples.
The man of the calva characteristic had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
On the other hand, I could also drive the car myself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol in play, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk drunk.
It was a nice night, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired only three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth of the finals," namely, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Uniera Urziceni, Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the downfall."
The "a lot more important interest" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then we will have to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The eight finals of the League of Champions (going parties on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return parties 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be sorted on 18 December in Nyon.
So there was limited joy for the full entrance of the successor of Babbel.
Not only in the alleged savior, who had soon inspired the uncontested Stuttgart professionals to trust themselves, disposition to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but that with the Babbel therapist had no effect.
He revealed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's partyer Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises at football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a break of several weeks due to a injury, progressed immediately until he became the best local player thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proviso "fresh wind" and the way to work with the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs most of all.
Like Gross, players and administrators also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defense weakened by the lack of reliefs and completely overcome by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come sad to wake up, he said to think about Kedeira.
And director Horst Heltt warned that although a target of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't got through the problem yet.
That Heltt did not wish to celebrate in his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his headquarters three months ago, due to the events of the weekend, which again took the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had granted the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
This had condemned weakness in the direction of the Governing Council, which had decided to change trainers because of the pressure of adolescent fanatics.
Also that he would have removed his day free after the games called Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heltt retired, and announced consequences for the latter.
They'll probably no longer be friends forever, the two forty.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the replacement trainer team, the show of great strength of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the unison; and he also agreed to the man in the plastic bag.
Battle of the world heavyweight championship
Burning duel in Bern: again and again, the late Kevin Johnson was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC Association won on Friday night in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already a world champion of WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to realize the nightmare that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be defeated due to his injuries.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his struggle number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators at the Berna Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, that before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was once again obliterating the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not be decisively leading his dangerous right goal.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a retard, and he only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was causing Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world championship.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retard had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," which "he can't do anything".
In carrying out the weighing, the champion left off on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from the nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year he won his title in his defenses in Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September in Chris Areola, U.S.A.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, had Klitschko explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after it was destroyed in November in Nikolai Valujev, from 2.13 metres of height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Apparently, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists require an explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent disclosures about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has deliberately misled him.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" broadcast, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "did not tell the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said that he lied.
The death order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Defence Corps for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was announced that in this attack it was not only an attempt to destroy the kidnapped trucks, but also an intentional killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 persons.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government policy of Afghanistan, and whether the Chancellor, the army and the information service had adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Kunast demanded this new strategy.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not exert any influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
The Saturday had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both of them had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two high-ranking officials it has been said that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with regard to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be the next Wednesday.
Worlds of the Ones
As a watchman, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug addicts are the boundaries of imagination and reality.
While it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are staying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver ourselves without any trouble to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience conditions similar to sleep during the watch, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are considered most times in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or in drugs.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality be distorted.
The informed state of consciousness that is truly modified can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be attributed to the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Allusions or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been unbalanced – above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a wake-up state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of the state of madness with the state of onyrics", for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the dispositives, allocated formations, and speculations of it".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels broken.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red balls like blood, deforming, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy boots and flaming, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Stirred and malignant voices come from the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, binds them to form a knot, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
It climbs into a box and puts the nude around the neck.
Jump.
The rope goes down.
What a lesson for you!, yell in a chorus that returns the tympans, "Go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of the product was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizophrenia-affection-paranoid psychosis; it is also maniaco-depressive, taking medications, anti-depression, mania, schizophrenia.
She's learned to live with her illness, she's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population fall ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inner world, and fall into a state of overexit that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing of voices: voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dream, psychosis also opens the computers to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatric clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the events, everything has a meaning towards it.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot be actively organized.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, the awakening is impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
On the contrary, in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are supported in reality, the distance of experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, there's still an unknown reason why our brain makes convertibles.
According to Fuchs, the state of exception can lead any person to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
Researchers assume that the affected suffers from minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown fact of how this change in the neuronal system occurs, which has not been shown at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of a psychosis when a previous disposition exists.
Similarly, alucigen drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
It is perceived as pleasant or does not often depend on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in our kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also surprisingly of many other diseases.
Among them are psychotic disorders such as the limited disorder of personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranial traumas .
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually repressed.
It occurs when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not stored; when our brain is heated, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania West and attended a college of secondary education.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, a boy has torpedoes with long and dark hair torpedoes his word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, besides her, listens or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and comes and listens to that boy, just like she sees and listens to the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she asks if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappearing.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you're in class sometimes you can't follow the lesson because the professor – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he clearly explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to come to sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, he can't tell whether he's awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the mules or the girl with bloodthirsty cuts in his arms and legs appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they'd think he was crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. She is now 20 years old.
He approved last year's selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Dishonesty is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's the same as looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifys night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the consciousness, imaginary experiences usually pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but it also includes something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The peripheryal hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that can later not differ from being awake.
Conscientious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience a motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewustsein eine motorische Lähmung experience.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world because of a total and permanent motor incapacity, he replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self- and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A form of a limited situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in imagination.
An intensive way to give sense and interpretation to an inaugural situation in itself that our own capacity to create enables us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen, from Zurich, also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an act of saving the soul.
He was 49 years old when his conscience sailed several days after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to the immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen dived into a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself laid in bed, a bigger man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot veiled for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by noblemen who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snowy snow and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Clausen, these journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, onionism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show the fragileness that is the inner reproduction of external reality, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will be charged with publishing at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, SPIEGEL commented.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years of age and have the firm's will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years of age, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been adjusted as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're trained for that.
One cannot put in front of his children 7,500 workers, unless they are trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the joint directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family has been a member of the Burda leadership since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, the treasure store was entrusted with the responsibility for the company's heritage. After the release of Jürgen Todenhöfer, the foreign market, printing and finance were also entrusted.
For the first time, no member of the family takes over the cover of the editorial.
The sons of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are also not safe from the decline: "This has always affected families that are left to be infected by the capital search, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great delights," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political precept in this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; these businesses have become too big.
Integral Beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish for, within the reach of your hand.
This is what it seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which has just opened in the mall of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Taci peluqueros; Marina d'Or, who owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a nutrition section, where the teterium is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes than this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you see the incredible views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and latest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the customer's steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on a touchscreen, facing the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, Luis & Taci has a room where rituals of hair recovery, lightness or nutrition are offered in a personal way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the assumptions of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Scores
It's about Christmas and it's never going to rethink the stars' looks to adapt them to our party dress.
The shape of the shield, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, has created the 'Live Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Live Office' will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to push forward what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
It is the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to stimulate the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European-level standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a calm horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the actions undertaken by the Executive throughout the exercise to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a view of abandonment, of closing some of our main productive plants," the president of the government explained.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the following brands in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can have a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integrated Automotive Plan (IPA), targeted 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's demand support measures, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and has resulted in a "strong increase" of the registrations, which grew by 40 per cent in November.
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Standard Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the whole engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, replacements, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies there will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche for sale and car restoration; or Classics car, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Ability tests on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Chamber will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Evidence of skill with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a circuit that is enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sport is not confused with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the system of stopping and starting the engine -based as i-Stop-, a device that is at least currently only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out by the good note reached throughout its whole.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitat, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front pockets present an excellent ergonomic and submission.
Also, the steering wheel touch is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument table and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of red and blue buttons and buttons and callous colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which they all want to beat.
Continuing with the habitat, this Japanese compact presents more than enough habitat for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is combined with a large and regular suitcase.
The engine stop and automatic start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 horses and with the manual change of six marches.
This engine is a real delight. It is superior to its fineness, its low noise, its benefits and its consumption.
And it is that even though the most demanding Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not realize a large number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-stop with a petrol engine, both for their high comfort of departure, and for their content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version selected for the test is called Sportive, which includes a larger number of serial elements.
The series equipment especially highlights the car exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch wires.
In addition, because of its little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon lamps and BOSE sound system with disc chargers, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It highlights in particular the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres per year can choose from this version i-Stop, associated only with the petrol 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21.770 in the Luxury finish and €23.270 in the tested version - Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
'Premier' luxury
L. A. covers the red sensuality carpet of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or navigate through the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly quota, less than half of what is paid, for example by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success of the company, two new devices have been released: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as your US counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience a physical doctorate is needed to understand them and some good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated ear shoots of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a perceived effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (do not stop being curious that takes the name of Fon when Wifi is missing) gets this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including trafficking in books and other online consultations.
No contracts and no tickets.
It's a connected device and it's paid for by buying it, not by month.
And that's what I'm hoping to see some day with FonPeek, an option to buy with life access such as that which Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he has already come to Barack Obama's take of possession as U.S. president with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with brilliant reflections-, the action twice consisted of three pieces - wearing, jacket and coat of the same canvas-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, in a first glance, it seemed that the first woman in the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat her dress.
But the screen on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession of a thread of fat, in Oslo it is a three-piece printed.
The plugins have also varied: green shoes of the middle heel again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the painting: a collection on this occasion, the melena swallows the previous.
75% of working mothers have had job problems because of their motherhood
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This reveals the study 'Fecundity and Trayectory Work of Women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the labour field due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of marriage and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a unstable job, begin to live together, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind in marriage and maternity, and have fewer descendants.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of fixed employment have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the start of the marriage, which increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have taken longer of their life-cycle to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, at least on the schedule of compensation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is different from the factors that distinguish women ' s age when married and when they are first married.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater the age to which they are married and the greater the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"An additional division among women is also established on the basis of their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies are married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a pre-marriage condition and the arrival of a child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of various brand products, immersing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors in the international panorama, joins in this way other famous paintings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a selected club were the actors Evangeline Lilly ('los') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomia de Grey') and Matthew Fox (a companion of Evangeline in 'lost').
British Fashion Prizes
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a number of radiographs of writers who have spent their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
He does not do so in the predictable and terrifying genres (biographical, life and work) but looking for something like the core of the creator's character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save suspense or lighting.
In addition to a exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I left them here for a few minutes.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulse, almost physical, the same as I felt without name: the pleasure against the axo, morals without guilt and innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with an amazing poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was stabbed by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, in which flesh united the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of the eight thousand metres of universal literature, which has to climb through the north wall, from which the best climbers are once and again. "
About William Faulkner, "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and others who was the son of a black man and a cocodrel.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry from a bridge by that character of Munich to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and made it on a journey running away from himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he fell on his knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer were recorded: 'Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ rest after the war,/ after the hard life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband readily accepted that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness has never been given."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but go to Baroja for the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do but bring the man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cobard Aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mystical breed, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without a word, they plied two traps that left the wounded dog.
Our indignation is overwhelming because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small and defenseless animal, which was, by the way, attached.
To this we must add the emphasis that caused a woman to walk quietly and that, when she added to these individuals, she came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic attacker on an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it's for a long time and not to generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse an defenseless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The Michelin Pneumatic Manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Vial Security Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmet, especially among the younger motorists, today informed both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using helmet, since it is the only protection element capable of preventing head injuries or, even, death in the event of an accident while driving a motorcycle.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond to design and manufacture products every day safer" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheeled tyres, one of its main aims is to develop more and more secure products.
Go up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in Spain in November represent a 12.6 per cent increase in 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of downfall, according to the numbers of Anfac and Ganvam producers' bosses.
The good data, not obscenant, should be put in quarantine as the reference to which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
As a result, despite the response of the last month, the accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, all vehicles consisting of the small-scale commercial shackle: from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/lighthouses.
Moreover, cloudships that most affect their demand have not disappeared since, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
As a result, restrictions on the closure of bank credits must be added to other factors such as the increase in the level of unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Prior to this panorama and unlike tourism, they have recently used aid for the purchase of 2000E.
They can be welcomed, in addition to the individuals, the autonomouss and the pymes that are going to acquire a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles and buses.
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which a decrease in sales (from tourism and 4x4) is estimated at 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As was the case with the anti-lock of ABS brakes and with the control of ESP stability, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all small new registrations and commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, in its way of working, it can also help to avoid many in-depth collisions.
The emergency brake assistant does what it does to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piotonium that gives the driver.
But this doesn't always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident did not get to tread the brake before collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be avoided annually involving pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four sinisters would be avoided with damage to persons - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and advises the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if collision is inevitable, the device shall make the maximum effort to minimize damage to the brakes.
General Motors delay until January the plan for Opel
While Opel plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th - as Javier Ortega reports, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants, is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can make the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which factories exist to be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows to contact some new possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but he strongly collects the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
On the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to develop its last, and face to joy, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to reach nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the bascule in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to deviate, first of all, from the automatic roof that has been complemented by one of the lons with manual action, saving 21 kilos; using aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air-conditioning, 13; reducing fuel storage from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 7 more kilos; mounting sports tanks other 12 and with light 19 inches, five.
Finally, abandoning the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the doors from one screen to another, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double-brake PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by California's secondary roads, on mountain tracks with really reversed trails
Its behaviour can only be described as irrevocable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not foot the asphalt with an amplom.
Rather, all the contrary: it was a long time we didn't test a model so small and lightweight that at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the curve step, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we order him to blow, slow, recover and express his motor...
What we're asking you to do, thanks to your address, as precise as you are, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Voluntary engine sound
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be powered by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's brake, already stretched earlier in the Panorama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from stopping or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car said the bays well.
Electronic aid only made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice when the dawn and gravilate, well into the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving that one can drive on the market and that it is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bang Girl'
Intima de Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and the occasional 'starlet' of the 'maison' shows, the singer spreads his malt face with as much consummation as his Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," it's a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives a victory in Israel
The Laboral Box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electric box, despite the many lows with which the Dusko Ivanovic team was counted, and thus is located in the leadership of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples was the best of its team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was supposed to supplement the major absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the big score from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to see in the final triumph.
The party started face-to-face for the blues, which were placed from the beginning in the marker.
That the first four canasts of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presupposed that they had jumped into the Israeli box with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artifacts of 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second room was more than the same, but the Alavé team opted for the inner game of Barak and Elijahhu's work, which was received with chests and applause in the return to which his home was, to continue to extend his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' splitter valuation had already assumed that it was not going to be the best night of Brazil.
But the party, despite being in charge of rest, was not decided nor much less, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their box they did not win anything, and with 'Elijah'' hurrying to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the return of the yellows to the light (50-49).
More inconvenient
Ivanovic's wounded but not much less dead needed to swallow a pair of games with a strong air catch, and in them came Mirza Teletovic's machine, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a calming rent (54-67), which they managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaves left the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not give up and try to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by failure, Ivanovic's men did not rush, defend themselves, and even though the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injury prevents the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaya lost sharply in Greece in front of the Olympics and gave it the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the castes, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the environment of the Peace and Friendship pavilion, nor by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe, with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room made it possible to dream of the Andalusia. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, crashed at 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave it back to the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, a combat story, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, subjected to the decalization of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing its superiority in both areas, where the lower by injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were dragging the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian alero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to unmount
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which in spite of the 19 losses, was shown above and even equalized the difference between the encounter in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leader of the group tamble.
The Unikaja tried to overcome the absences and the last low of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they touched and given their superiority in centimeters within the area were unparalleled.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to remount the counter cover 81-62, minute 37, and the Unikaja turned off, handing the leader over to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with a higher number of classified real estate, employment and motor ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculate the user's wages from the more than 140 000 employment offers provided by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "is feeling unremunerated", explained in a communiqué the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data provided by Trovit of his searchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer collects EUR 45.226 per year and a French, 31.059, compared to the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges EUR 34.247 annual net in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst waged work in Spain is that of a cameraman, with EUR 11,592 per year net; followed by the dependant, with EUR 14,725; and by the operator, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are driving, working on average, and working on a social worker.
Brazil dates to Zelaya exit
The Brazilian Government has appointed Manuel Zelaya to remain in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President's deposit shall leave the diplomatic relationship by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when he will officially complete his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the businessman of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been refugees since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, at the end of his term of office, he has to look for another destination."
She also quoted the former envoy, who confirmed her intention to leave the embassy before the appointed deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the state of political asylum that was intended to impose on her "in fact" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was to money debt with direct acquisition of assets and indirectly to give a liquidity bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to buy off assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of risk-reduction premiums.
The Volatility of the Bags and the differentials of the corporate bonds have returned, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels that they reached in the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risks and public debt again became affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the euro area countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability, but at that time came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not wrong to call upon advocates of the moral risk that were once again attempting to raise awareness about world economic policy leaders because they have stopped the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is a new day of thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficit, elections and a new government that removes the blanket.
I sold it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro-member country to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
Yes, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excess in balanced positions, would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend as much as European corporate bonds should not concern us.
If European differentials decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiopathic risk.
The standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing the majority of study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their 2011 rise, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are recharged with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, they do not long for the life expectancy of their warning.
Again, you have the whole picture that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even now "prudence, friend driver".

The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Sub-Commission of the Congress of Members in which the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushed-up of what he had put in the subcommission at the closed door.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided nuclear power plants are kept open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 6 billion, but up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdola considers that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes and there will already be an increase in power.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act, which has just been approved by the Government, is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to bleed with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the President of Iberdola called them.
In any case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although in the long term, should start to take place as they are already lagging behind and a stable wage framework is needed to address them.
Railway wins Air Lingus' action in ten airports
The Railway branch for ground-based airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the preferred partner role of Irish Airlines Air Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The partnership envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the centre will investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Action disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtivot and Bouygues
Action fights for its first concession highway in Australia, the market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 million).
French Bouygues and Sister Hochtivot are on rivals.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Action to sit in the country as a construction and concessionaire of highways.
The City Town Hall wants to keep it up to date by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP by its English-language stamps) to move forward the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the payroll.
Pending their tenders next May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million in Australia (EUR 1,047 million) and, in the last phase, three consortia with a significant presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in lice, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, plays.
The third and last consortium that has passed the crib is the so-called LBRJV, where they share capital the Australian Lighton (the subsidiary of the German builder Hochtift, in turn participating in the ACS), the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala signature specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it presents a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction signature.
A strategy that has followed the Hochtiv or Bilfinger cited above, in addition to Asian references, which continues to be an outstanding allocation for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtift, owner of the so-called Lightton.
Millionaire assets
It acts by a geographical area of utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of decommissioning.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaide's desalination, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and use synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground footing road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (North link), is called for connecting Toowong's western highway with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The Administration's calendar sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last few months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two carriages per purpose, an electronic footing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business in Hochtift
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtift, who announced yesterday that a contract with the Government was valued at 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its local Leighton branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with optical fibre cable.
This action will provide fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will provide work to Germany for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has crossed the King George Tower building project of 27 plants in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to start and Hochtift closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2,1 km in length for a Slovenian motorway of EUR 64,5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
Thus, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its term of implementation will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to Mrs Rushmore for the next two years for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract collects the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA, who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be the design and production manager for the campaigns.
Lots of 63 million to France Telecom to stop competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Telecom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephone competition with the signature of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers beyond regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company have accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 to put their competitors to work.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recurring.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the star of other operators and has opened a web application store to increase revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange's application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have earned more money in the competition.
The list leader is Manchester United.
The list leader is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from the major clubs.
Thus, the competition has distributed EUR 5,362.5 million to 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the 1992/93 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well out of this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent that has paid more money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalán, the current champion and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup, is the fifth of the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern of Munich, the two teams that also paid more for participating in the last League of Champions.
And that, despite losing both in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Layout
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million just because they were there, plus another 550,000 euros for each dispute party.
There are also bonuses for winning (€800,000) and for empatriating (€400,000 for each team). Octavofinalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the Europe Supercop in August.
But there are also variable payments to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's champion remained with 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party shall be paid according to the number of parties that are played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The New Rumasa group destroyed yesterday the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it continued to acquire a peak of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the titles.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for action that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest in that postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos' shares closed at EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company by 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerezano group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling titles.
CNMV made sure it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateos' company claimed that he had contacted the regulator.
If so, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalization was 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain in the range of possible purchase offers and the judicial waves of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as the director of internal audit.
A decision that turns it into the first woman who holds a high position in the food business.
This is a new creation position which will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not free of debate, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it can't be discounted that over the next few months Sos unveils new fund fluctuations
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday in the National Hearing and claimed that they approved the 212 million deviation without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorises Paterina's exclusion blind presented by Inversora Mer
The National Market of Values Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion clause submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation when it understands that its terms are in accordance with the existing rules and considers the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares from Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8.95% of its social capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been mobilised, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the current legislation.
New tools to test cars
In these days of time and accidents, not only do they win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered from a sinister are removed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated work.
Calculate the cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30,000, including pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, the issue would be reduced
Thus, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of sinisters and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Group Solara, is the leading signature; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
Other firms that compete in the field of taxation and information tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed does not stop increasing, to the point that in the last five years there have been second-hand versions, idiosyncratic versions than in the previous fifteen.
As a new car goes out to the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and enter your price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be painted.
If it is a venemasive model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99 per cent.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of databases, Auditex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditex invests EUR 90 million per year in developing these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools for handling parts of waste or for calculating the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinister assessment solution for experts.
It includes light or heavy industrial cars, motorcycles and vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the pieces, include the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use it less than ten times a month.
After each insurance company, which carries out thousands of searches, negotiates its price with Audetex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it emerged from the mounting line only with its trailer number.
AudaGlass focuses on the months of vehicles, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to upload by declared vehicles total sineiro.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by homodole marks.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to deficiencies or how many serious sinisters have suffered in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercialises, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The assessment guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20 per cent per year over the last three years, and in 2008 it accounted for 10.8 million euros.
Early last year, they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Auditex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1,000 million in Bolsa, and its actions now amounted to a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet usage of damaged cars
Last October, the Solara group purchased Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars as special motor vehicles or motor vehicles.
The transaction was disbursed by EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the capital of the company, which could be extended to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, disadvantages and professional sellers that need to be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages over 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number has been lowered cannot be recirculated, but can be used as spare parts that are not damaged.
Historically, cars can get high even if they have been given low after a dangerous operation.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audetex ensures that the user obtains a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, which to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more responsive to new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 landowners, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with Internet connection.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its builder number, a real graphic image of the model in question is displayed and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hand, recharges or discounts, and then you can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this workshop tool is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the Audetex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics come with very good eyes, for example, allowing them to select a door and give it back to see the inner face.
