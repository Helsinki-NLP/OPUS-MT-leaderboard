The triumph of the right populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakness of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian popular party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillated, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Vice-President of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national politics.
According to provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse, it went to the OVP, which loses almost 9% of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the Dopowarra and, above all, the literally catastrophic result of the peoples, who have led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the peoples had a significant advantage in the preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them because they have caused the government to sink.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party's president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monter.
Observers believe that it could happen already Monday during the extraordinary call of the party's management.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path to the ever more likely way out of the electoral outcome, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties (FPÖ) have already won 18% and BZÖ 11% of the votes, but socio-democratics have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists agreed with the peoples to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) which was also the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution it obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If we failed to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of Scarabei in India, we would have, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not to be resolved, then it would be possible to have some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee, after the negotiations, said that executive power can hardly enter into legal acts.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Szvácha, who has been charged and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with that local in Darjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to use a ‘ higher position.
Then he can ask for the release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Court of Justice then it will be possible to obtain grace," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the front is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Minister of India has supported.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being lent by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a profound error in the imprisonment and charge of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question whether he has obtained the promise to take care of the matter from the Indian side.
"I have obtained relatively many promises," he said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and adjacent marine zones.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosooso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His head, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed is still hiding a little known world rich in natural resources.
It’s possible to find the oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that have been unknown so far that they carry within themselves the key to discovering the medicine against cancer.
The largest ground floor of the ground
The coastal states have begun to give interest to the sub-marine.
According to the United Nations Convention, they took advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly the area of the so-called continental platform, which is often extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention to all resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platform it is meant that part of the seabed and its subfloor that is a natural extension of the continent below the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic area extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country presents to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It’s the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to seek the Commission's legal and technical assistance.
The Committee has so far addressed 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three appointments have been successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly expanded its marine assets, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the committee last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so more or less six times the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will grow in the future from seabeds, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since it was ratified "the Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity begins."
No one has been in an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Foundation is not Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it spreads with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as by investors in a few other states, the status of so-called "pioner investor".
He has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the ‘investor’ and slightly larger than ‘ex Czechoslovakia’.
The bottom is fractured, it's a nearly submarine replica of Tatry.
"E" can be extended over the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich jewel of polymetallic aggregates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan explains.
A Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings him a repertoire to show him.
It looks like a little patata or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the wake of the Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready but did not intervene.
In the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages under investigation, more and more detailed information is available.
On the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9, the federal aviation police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the spokesperson for the ministers announced on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages running away.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as direct assistance on the spot.
"We didn't get lucky," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September, attackers kidnapped a group of travellers in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the camps were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Ciad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remains secret as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberators arrived in good condition at Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
No explanation was given for the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they would be returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 vacationers and special units should start flying with an Airbus of military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress just failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227 the American House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals made by American President George W. Bush and first-rate politicians by both parties, there was no majority for the programme, which would have had to justify the chaos of the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics from the heavy package of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the treaty leaders, has encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While the suffrage was under way, the Dow Jones was raised by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investor concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It shall be resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, it shall churn again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the well-being of both the House of Members and the Senate.
Proponents record increases in bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the invoice on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year was clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the weak conjunctivities, the desire to travel from the Germans is still a matter of investigation.
On the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a plus 31 % invoice compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German Association for Tourism RDV informed Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased booking rates for autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would be up to around 11%, the RDV reported.
The figures for these results are the GfK figures, which each month analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
They would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar allocation, particularly the travels in the United States would be requested, the RDV reported.
Here the increase of bookings would amount to about a third.
In addition, travel targets would be particularly requested in the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as in Germany.
In particular, all the travels included have a high rating, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increased costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made in advance or offered with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that, compared to the year before, there would have been a surplus of the invoice - even if, according to a further study, the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year, had disappeared.
My first time at Octoberfest
Ballermann hits, beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's blonde, TV moderator and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is: just 3 minutes in Wiesn, the photos are already thrown against us and they take photos until they fill the memory of the photographic machines – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends make each other.
The two-money Dirndl seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident in the north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of wellness in the costume/dress to this day is still within the limits.
And then once you arrived at Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or the leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's hug collects foreign looks at the banana stand at chocolate.
A nun tells me that I would have raised the groove in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
Suddenly, I'm going to have my back-to-left flash.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less loss of subtle flirt techniques and wear hat hats, on which the cape "To drink to get dressed!" and turn the naked finger against an uninvited one.
The boy with displayist inclination is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a squeaky "oooo."
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks it's a potato.
Bob is one of these "Wildbiesler" families.
Others don't have the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8 o'clock in the evening walk in white on the square of the feast, the healthy, who must take care of the poor
The nurses compare each time in white – always 4 times they draw a tent-covered bar in the tent.
This works as with most of the visitors of Wiesn: it goes empty, it returns full.
Those who play under the telone in this bar at an alcoholic rate in the blood, you can't see it.
"Des syn die, who goarnimmer packn", screams at me one of the sanitizers and scatters in the baraonda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romeford, but she died shortly after.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the charge of dissatisfaction.
It was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate into the Turkish territory.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful remnants of this fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renascimental style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most westerly passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the ice-creams of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces marched out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha's station.
In 1917 a ammunition train broke down destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has gone slowly into dissatisfaction, far beyond history.
Today, however, this train ride for Anatolia and all the points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the ice-creams of the cold war, has passed.
Now there's a new commitment policy.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was on my way to bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a race to subballs along the tracks that produced the ancient world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn back to its October past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents an exemplary move in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi brings me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by commercial centers and power pastries, where managers in full business - both men and women - meet to make first-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a right-wing policy from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure there was also a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its entrance.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point, "I ask, will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
He then points out that almost all those with whom I spoke have been reminded: not only the links between the Middle East and the Caucasus, but also around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as far as Turkey is concerned.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's medium-term ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look forward to the terminal for the transport that leads me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man in Europe".
At the time, at least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should advance claims on this fascinating country.
Quick remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11,) had been in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21 years of age, but when the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to cope with all that music had to do, both madrical and Messiaen, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often it was told by Todd "lascair that it is the music to speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the backpack was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowering.
Whatever the music standard was, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a director of the orchestra, Vernon Handley would have been.
I knew him very well during the two decades when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the last 40 years and more I have dealt with over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in disagreement with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the orchestra leaders who, in his words, simply "were riding around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (September 25,) specifies that "in 1946 he studied economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Hobullon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, letter and PhD".
This follows from the note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, although treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A sample that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on the Honda surpluses
In November the Honda will launch the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model had already had a large habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanic must be added to everything, which increases the comfort of the driver and enables fuel saving.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market entry.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe, the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is precisely Japan's case, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 units of this model, the estimates for 2009 were about 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the managers of the Spanish branch are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the loss of sales in Spain by a good measure.
In fact, the company's managers are expected to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, the Honda is confident of another new model coming.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4,37 meters long - from which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the diameter is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living room is also expanded.
This advantage derives from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – equipped with double background – salt to 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of engine version 1.4 and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 luggage is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear lights or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, start with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both machines include i-VTEC technology that allows lowering consumption, producing less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizing the machine and at the same time maintaining the engine pair high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv to 6,000 rounds with a maximum couple of 114 Nm to 4,900 rounds.
The propulsion – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
With regard to previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now available at 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "car ape" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of the bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Nissan Four Area Security Shield.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturing house.
During the flight, each water creates an oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with a angle above 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption into its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined a laser location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculate the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"At the moment when it detects a obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of an ape and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a right or higher angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer the head of this project.
Unlike an ape, the robot cannot turn upward or downward, and not even in a diagonal; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not exploit infinite directions and ways the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan expects to be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to a destination by avoiding the obstacles present in the path.
Trema before you ask for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, in addition to having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging in mutual dissatisfaction in banks, they have created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Lost Credit Hotel" or the problems.
The tetro looks at this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to make you think not one, but two or even three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Of course, the information provided by the game is useful, but it is not detailed.
It's more a page for teenagers than a website for the general public.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, compare a song room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to the MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, resulting in a net reduction in its shares in Borsa.
A week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholdings at an individual cost of $25.25, which is an amount equal to $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per cent, i.e. a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
At 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley went down from $6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow them to differentiate their actions by making it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the one in the past.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan simply announced the sale of 20% of his shares in the Japanese Colosseum for a sum equal to $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the world economy and in the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MFG will receive Morgan Stanley's titles at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would translate into an investment of at least 20% of equity on a dilute basis."
The agreement provides that the MFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter will be exchanged over 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG will allow them to take investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A group spokesman, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan pointed out that he had "clearly" eased his budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to a hard test, which has seen a reduction in the value of its actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has been forced.
The cost that flowed on Monday, however, remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "resisted" among Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns' and Lehman Brothers' hookup and Merril Lynch's discovery, announced that he had taken $15 billion, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism in the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the last to give a voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
A mission made since 64% of the electors voted on the referendum, on the basis of an 80% vote.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be taken, one more.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the election sessions and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a striking victory of "yes", situated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed proudly", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in all calm according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 acts to consolidate the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
This draft Constitution confers the power of the state on the economy, reserveing it the "planning of development" of a country that essentially lives on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also accords more power to the Head of State, which may be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, will have the opportunity to disband the assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its own application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free provision of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
19 free hostels in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Ciad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15 and 30, on board a special aircraft.
On board an helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential area of Cairo, to be subjected to analyses.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom "to kidnappers" has been paid," said Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
Repeated on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept away from hiding to another 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group was composed of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypttous, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were shootings, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others were fled," said the manager who demanded to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by the German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces from Belgrade.
We must admit that if we have obtained this result, it was thanks to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also lied about the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese Pattuli army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on board and had killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and had captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of Darfur rebels, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately lied to by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign is concentrated.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
What policy will the federal government be forced to reinstate that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the only restoration of the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage are preserved, with four moneys, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space for history and heritage be reserved?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The states of Benelux, through partial nationalisation, help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank, which is in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest in Hungary too.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level at the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions made in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had started with a vertical hook, serious signs of the institution's crisis had then been presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point of 14 years.
As of January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank managers, this value is not real.
The company's head is responsible for the collapse of Fortis' shares in the uncertainty of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
Monday, the title came back slowly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new bank administrator.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but so far no one has made a valid offer.
The Belgian government had already made sure that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
The bank's clients didn't panic, the subsidiaries didn't panic.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also purchased leases.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers, based on medical data from people, often refuse to provide an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a programme of privacy according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the chicken to the fox" - writes Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies shall be subject to the insurance rate and the amount in the event of accidents to the health status of the client and if they are too high the risk does not provide for the insurance.
The customer had to undergo a medical visit while the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily have information from the medicines he has bought in the last year and half, and from this the evince program of which diseases are suffering and in which health conditions are found.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is incredibly high and is classified in the highest risk category.
In trade there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer, besides the paper work, does not remain much, even if there are little difficulties.
On the other hand, some medicines are useful for several purposes, such as some compounds are useful against migraine or heat vampires, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is a risk increase, the first two nos.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, individual companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacists, request the patient's approval.
The authorities are now obliged to do so even though they have not so far influenced much for neglect.
Some companies have recently developed the results of laboratory tests and have linked them to medical data to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more firms have access to data and, in parallel, control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress, there is a legislative proposal that gives the authorities the powers to control the data-processing companies.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links the further data with the consent expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny the approval so much because, otherwise, insurers do not provide for the contract.
So then at the end the chickens are entrusted to the tenderness of the wolf.
Global Marsiglie Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade primarily, also the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit that will focus primarily on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit organised yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, have received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they have found the agreement to double in five years, that is to increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious approach.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also take the road in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused attention on global factors.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter, condemned in all its forms by both parties, and called for a United Nations conference.
They encouraged the conclusion of the Doha Round trade, even though both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would want to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global pact for the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50% by 2050.
They also want to slow down the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India today will be in French capital, where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French firms receive a turnover of EUR 20 billion.
According to information from our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
To Francoforte more than three hundred Italian publishers
High presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt awaits this edition of over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guests of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry of the Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the press at the Room Struktur in the 5.0 Pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books on total Italian production decreases gradually, in particular for adults and boys.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's flight was recovered, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada Desert.
The wrecks were found on a 3,000-metre hill in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
In the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, fled the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Office (Ntsb) has informed that a team of investigators has been sent hours after the notice of the return, which has then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which has been released since 3 September 2007, when Fossett withdrew from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal effects of Fossett had been discovered by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a portfolio.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he made the world's round in flight and without a ladder.
Among his many records, he also flew 15 445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clean corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compaties" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to make a new venture in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and non-conventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the start of the new car will also start an unpublished mode of communication through an adventurous 3D showcase campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A Maxi-affizioni project, divided into three different stages, which will dominate the central way of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic view and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car is out of the manifest.
Then, through the use of the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then incorporated into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it be possible with this formula to stifle the interest of future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Trivenet, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls from whom all of Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the group "Utras Italia" which has been following the National Azurra for years and which, since then, for the truth, has never created too many problems.
He's never had a fight with the enemy fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have added groups (less units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-coloured flags where the cities of origin of the militants are commensurate: on Saturday night they were taken to not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoria.
In Bulgaria they have found a tefarious of true Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominees, so easily controlled.
And the Viminale actually controlled them all: among those matches for Sofia, there was no one with a Daspo running, no one who was stopped from attending a stadium.
At four blue fans, who had previously committed in the stadium, the ticket was in fact rejected and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo that prevents not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in other words, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than fifty, if they add others to it.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who is acting this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes well opened especially in view of the National Wednesday's game in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of the Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow we meet the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of Asia, that is to say, secret services, which deal with stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce Cori and the cloth arm during Mameli's womb? In Bulgaria it is not done ...".
This thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) by Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli in the past was named after Trieste, where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not able to hold the Duke but of course the behavior of those 150-200 fans was embarrassing.
"I do not make the sociologist - add the No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes are attributed to the country in which the case is taken.
Until now this group has remained in line, we will now see what has happened and we will evaluate it for the future.
But we're also talking about fig trees in Mameli's nest: even those that aren't done, but if you allow me, they're not education...".
