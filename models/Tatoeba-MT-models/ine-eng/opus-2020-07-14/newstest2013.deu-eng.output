A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, confirming that the election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of elections in each country.
In this respect, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make the procedure for registering or urination difficult.
After the November 2010 elections, 675 new Republican representatives could be listed in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral rights in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the electors to provide a statement of light and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the preliminary vote, declare the right to register as electors on the election day, and give citizens the right to vote for which an act of law is in force.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State has asked the voters to provide a light image.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law.
The Republican authorities agreed to extend this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they have promoted legislation in 34 federal states that force voters to display a light image.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal insurance card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a statement of light issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a statement.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required statement.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low income are unrelentingly affected.
In fact, 25% of Afro Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary lighting evidence.
That's still enough.
Students who are considered to be electors who increase their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photocopy issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of nationality to be elected.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their citizenship in the US.
These measures clearly aim to limit the Spanish votes.
Because it is in the hands of two out of three Spanish voters who prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted legislation in eight federal states, with which the registration of voters was abolished on the election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide those voters with support who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections has contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the 2010 registration of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters elected in advance were African Americans, although only 13% of the voters of the state were elected.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites who represented 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their adherents have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the vetos of democratic governance.
The U.S. Attorney General has signed up to enforce the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have passed laws requiring the demonstration of a light image.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics undermine the partial political nature of the laws adopted and see in them the impact of the results in the countries that have been successful for 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those States that have adopted these laws make 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the rules on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatatak's early recognition: should the test be performed or not?
The PSA test shows, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger tendency for previously undecided men to carry out early recognition tests.
Whether or not to play a sound when messages arrive.
We have drawn the opinion of two experts.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study also showed that in a 12-year follow-up study, the probability of metastases formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early recognition has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old age when you have a direct relative who has already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
For men of African-American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancer species that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
Patients must be made aware of the extent of the risk of their cancer by showing them the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more determined to be active in the monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men with cancer have no treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and are given treatment in the course of disease progression.
The criteria for a decision that should be dealt with and not dealt with are increasingly accurate.
That's why I recommend the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international company for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of illness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of Canadian cancer society.
However, about 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer species.
It's seriously damaging people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up on the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositions also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, breast, stomach, stomach, stomach and stomach cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against crimson cancer throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
To a large extent, it increases the risk of becoming ill with a crimson or stomach cancer.
Whiskers should also be put in place.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additions and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not final.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on Vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study revealed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family load.
"The conduct of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
Analysis of the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has gained some insight last summer, and this for good reason.
The fact is that this Boson is not less involved than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle, whose existence from the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet observed.
But for the physicist, it's not quite sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's actually about the Higgs, because there seems to be only a small risk of fooling ourselves, and we're looking at what it's about.
There is a mandatory law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try it too hard as you get hurt.
For even though particle physics is a truly rare world, it turns out that it also applies to it such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quanten state", with this "state" in large and full of some of their properties.
From this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are known as Fermione and are politely obedient to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the Bosons move, an evil band of anarchists, who are not sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboren (which is absolutely amazing): the Mesons that we are not being treated here and the "power particles", which distribute the great forces of nature and which would somehow be related to the Higgs boson.
However, it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic power.
If a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" at this site, like a brick stone, which has been thrown into a pond.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the Bosons of the Power.
Stable Fields
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "distorted" so that this Boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the diver must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold from itself at the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as the other photos) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good" now, does Mrs. Plamondon ask?
For science, they serve the verification of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to examine precisely all differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
In addition, there are numerous physicists who hope to find such deviations, since the smallest difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation of the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell labs did not expect their work to trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, invented the laser in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent beam (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning as a "labor play".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be made from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eyes" and introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... 中 Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Deaths in War", Quebec recently discussed the big issue of the end of life.
The debate needs to be resumed in the short term, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that attacked him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half a dozen, in his home bed for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived on the morning.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an unnecessary weakness prevents her from going to the toilet alone and even eating herself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he consents to help with the meal.
It is even able to smile at him and talk to the strangers who are concerned about him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my throughput, because this is depressing," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinning in the rock," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he says.
Because, in the view of several people who work in Palliative Care, major events take place in the midst of these steps.
Patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For a woman A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by torture".
But because of the disease, I have really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that you put up a mask that helps you breathe.
In the coming days, however, she expects another last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home, Victor-Gadbois is offered with a group of voluntary body care and care for food intake.
The palliative care will then be used if there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants come to a bed for palliative care.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the world.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You give the dying person a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi, as you wish.
Diabetes should no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 who enjoys the last family meeting in court and is well supported by his pillows, while he is attacked by his honor, a young man of 36 dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, tragically, after trying to survive everything.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been placed with cancer patients under 45 years of age," explains Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to their home Victor-Gadbois come from their home and 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that should relieve the suffering of patients if the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Precisely this great insufficiency in health care, Quebec ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care take care of the adoption of a law to regulate death aid and assisted Suizid with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been on the move, signed by prominent individuals of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to prove their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care are transferred to death aid before they are accepted.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who has been in need for 14 days of severe pain without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncolologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
The survival prospects of Hélène Richard have already been minimal when she has discontinued a major chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have prayed to die thank the care staff for not having done this wish after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
But it must be clearly said that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, the head of the palliative care of the household palliative care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not speak of pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often go back to the terminal sedation, which leads to the patient either sporadicly or permanently until his death.
We can't do as much as we can if we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to be able to return to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me in bed," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate candals large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the street building, companies of the construction industry, money buyers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A "industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is remarkable how the system is falling apart since drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, MPs in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the distortions in relation to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the former Prime Minister had only agreed to.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the recruitment of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he stressed that "the Ministry of Transport alone had delivered a billion dollars to the contracts", because some had given in to their instincts in order to obtain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already caused two mayors to fall," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 life call, permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to test the economy, research and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe" who has since 2009 had the effect that Montreal's "canalization cartel" is taking place in the artistic appearance of the detainees...
In the last few weeks, she has, in particular, carried out domestic investigations and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just returned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that, in the exchange for public contracts, it will have been repeated to receive fines.
In addition to the road construction engineers of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito were explicitly charged.
The latter has taken stock of the Commission's statement of the "system" function for the procurement of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a broker in connection with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He was also able to organize an illegal acquisition for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canal contracts whose costs were artificially incurred by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as savings of $736,000 as a counter-performance for sewerage contracts, whose costs he artificially paid.
Other officials of the street building have admitted that they were smiling by artificially blowing up the calculations with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately avoiding a shadow budget that filled his boxes with money.
As a result of these discoveries, Mr Tremblay returned early in November, causing Montreal to fall into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal to beat the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a community property since 2010 that she had acquired $5 million and was sold to construction companies in the booming real estate market for 1.6 million.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is finally being carried out, she says that she "draws at a path that allows her to understand the way of functioning of the ameis-based system in order to stop the evil and to attack the debtors".
She says that the procedure is "suffering, but positive".
However, we are in the process of cleansing the wounds, but only need a specific detection unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that "the officers have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all, thinking about the role of the "mandates who are about the tactics in the picture", if they were not deceived!
Starting with a 70% blackout in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he said, "I was told that this was only a weak discount of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "If election expenditure is not strictly limited, money will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete review of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by taking the matter with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about throwing a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are here.
Every day, I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
They are therefore making use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entrances of this summer are used to playing very high levels.
They also know that every training unit is successful.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stars and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's supported by co-trainers like Claude Makeelle, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
In the League 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is among the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with viewed associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the League 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have thus qualified for the eighth final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can extract the backgame of the eight-finals as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for that...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and become a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially available as a means of adopting concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a big mistake not to win the title in the League 1 as it was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really in the heart to cancel this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the chance to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot of us are expected.
We accept it completely.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can imagine, it's definitely something frustrating.
You're wondering what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League, we've proved our strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and has also done huge expenditures!
With regard to the invested sums, you believed in a 15-point game break!
It was said that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of sight.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "bossed by this new PSG".
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
For the better you speak of a "Zlatan-dependency".
This means that Ibrahimvic is powerful and shoots many doors.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
Everywhere he played, he led in the eyes that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he's done is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some time in the game.
I've seen things that I've gone from.
Today I managed to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we have to commit ourselves to a provocative act.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, closes to the players and stands to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a game of action required in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's used to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, a political vision can be grasped: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro etc. convertible) as well as a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course in June 2011 reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros), it fell five months later to $2, before it recovered today to about ten dollars (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time the account holder, examiners, cash issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the trading bitcoins are available in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to insert this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on computers, while the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a backup of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole is "hatched".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is correct.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated from the network and the other will remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halfed, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred million, which allows a certain amount of space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing performance is increased.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin devices were stolen.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced paymium, which is a real money-paying company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows this deficiency.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others, such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," is pleased Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
Furthermore, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders, and the latter need not install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify only one address that can be "photographed and recognized by a phone", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are overthinked in favour of stronger horizontal systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin is implemented, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB intends to re-evaluate the various risks that have been considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We've been removed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States were expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army regains the possession of its territory and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves killed with our 88 soldiers, as well as the injured and the wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by Shihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tads.
Tolerant, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French credits, was well done.
The cargo and panzer convoys overrun by Hubschrauber have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flow of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their inconsistencies from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was moved from the war due to the fights of the various refugee groups.
It was then considered to be a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of Al-Qaida-surpassed farmers, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mudschaeddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have become business-makers by taking over government property to sell them as a country of construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive US award of subcontracts.
They made a call, and most of them were not even involved in the fight.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who were able to make use of the American grants could: capital escape is considerable.
The young people have stopped the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population are under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million people, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the individual parties or to corrupt certain leadership, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are occupied by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command they will stand be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, would have benefited from some decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state out of it with a strong presidential violence.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for a long time.
Industry has not been rebuilt again, efficient plants are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that has been led by war for 30 years, State control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The story was spread that Afghanistan had huge land estimates.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on site to rely on it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, there is no mountain construction possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary to re-establish normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys Gymnasia, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been set up in 2012 to carry out numerous non-profit works and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the restoration of agriculture and to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of the compatibility of aid and opportunistic actions.
These works, which were necessary for the numerous local workers, can help to suppress the challenge: watering, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What kind of souvenirs do we put back after military spending of two billion euros?
A much smaller budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard on a scale of more than 2000 metres.
In the message, dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from communities of the province of Kapisa have been received.
In order to free the farmers from the rebellion of foreign groups, as they wish, the continuation would be less, well-controlled and they would need direct civil assistance for their benefit.
A Constitution with a break-in in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to place everything on a map in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives it unlimited power, more than ever, it remains divided.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will be adopted on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal relationship.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President continues to suffer in his "autocrat delirium", by continuing "to break his word" and "to break the law with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which the brothers are forced to abandon their plans to explain the text section for the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the Presidents to regain their public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is killing throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
When the Egyptian people are put to an extreme vote with this back-up: "either you agree to my draft or I retain the unlimited full power," the latter should probably end after the constitution has been adopted.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not met the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they withdrew because they felt that they had not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, alternate members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally unanimously adopted.
The commentators also found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the hour of prayer, as some members of the body of the opinion felt that the pendant hour of the constitutional assembly was not enough.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a more stringent application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Holyness" represents the Liberals who see this only as a propaganda blow.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In doing so, they have given particular attention to Article 220, which is recognised by the University of Al-Azhar as a advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The concerns of the Liberals are also raised by the fact that the next Rector of this university is far less consistent than the present one.
"At this time there is no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits, "that, in relation to Article 220, there may be a multipleity, as the terms used are estranged from the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised about the extent to which civil servants are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will there be any prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have required.
The latter also share their fears about the text they see as a threat to freedom.
The existence of blasphemy will be maintained, and complaints are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article concerns the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the world's navel and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land unites itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and an unaffected nature.
The AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Avoiding the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who swim in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on water, the setting of the sea tower and the fishing.
Even here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most saints, however, are located in Jerusalem.
The path of suffering and crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossroads, the stone of salvation and the tomb of Jesus are located.
It is here, in the Christian view, of the scourges of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend of the tree grew from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complainers, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave Zettel with wishes that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies, which allowed Herod the Great to build for his family in the year 25 C.E.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high is the famous Hermon ski area, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
An ancient legend suggests that pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On only one trip, not all can be seen.
But at least five of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or written scrolls from the Dead Sea found in caves in the Jewish desert as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works of the impressionists and expressionists is presented there, mont, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several sells of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is told by one of the most frightening chapters of history.
The most aggressive department is the monument for the children, which was built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, complete darkness prevails.
The star function.
And they pronounce the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they die.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also built in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is built all year round.
On the other hand, this unusual sea with a position of 417 metres below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-smoker without problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt) and healing sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the relaxation of unscrupulous nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Old Age
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were intertwined.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and here Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists would like to be damaged by the narrow streets, which are named after star signs.
Fortune is supposed to be the legend of everyone who touches the walls in the gas with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly mentioned couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo deadlines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stretch through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of Roman statesmen, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theater, evening concerts and operas are featured today.
Bookmark list for tourists
If you go to Israel, you don't worry about your poor English knowledge: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in euro, but in dollars that can be easily converted into a currency (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only bus line in the country with six stations connecting the city to the capital.
It's just a underground stopway.
A journey within the city costs up to 1.5 hours, regardless of the means of transport.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at stake.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and guesthouses only served delicious food, which excludes pig meat, seafood products, fish without mushrooms and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish Humus pasta, various sauces, fried beans from pure beans and herbs (falafel) and fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel, there are no wandering dogs.
For this there are many well-known cats that stream comfortably and unscrupulously through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like living places and don't say no to lecheries.
A car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Gettz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance also costs $15 a day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Access cards for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Number
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the fans and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, corresponding to an increase of 51% over the 2010 comparative period, before the visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Each year 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that stayed at home.
On 1 December a law entered into force which, according to each migrant worker, must pass a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests are to be carried out in the future for all guest workers according to the Federal Migration Authority.
This requires not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the maintenance and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training products and diplomas prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
The whole of the test sites will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Society, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can leave the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press many times the following question was raised: What does the whole matter?
What changes does the rule of language require, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, the opposition spokesmen of the Migration Authority are going to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected against their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
There are problems with migrants without professions, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language will necessarily meet people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow baracke, where he will be hearing with dozens of his own months without food and documents and creating 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised a promise, and on arrival you will be deceived, get your passports taken off and will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the chief administration for labour migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't screw up, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia do not only control the language of the target country, but are unable to express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not as much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, usbeks and tadbeans can provide only a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, they hesitate to buy them decent clothing, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children then seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's hard without language," they say.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights highlight the following important aspects of the law.
The test must be carried out only by migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegally employed in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Prohibited access to unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic horrors and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for half a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of repression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just don't look at the cost of fake papers"
Already on the day the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the migrants' registration documents could be counterfeited.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been taken by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake paper was printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get it anyway: every Migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates can not be bought easily, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in criminal cases is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
To this end, the authorities respond to the latest events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the killing of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in the public and set up the age for the possession of guns from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and has promised that the amendments to the Duma law will be tabled shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various weapons associations - asked the authorities to take a distance from "free reinforcements".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed by the criminal, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the application of the registered weapons over six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a strengthening of the law on private arms owners will not prevent them from operating on the black market.
At present, you can find every possible weapon for a small amount of money, according to the authors in Moscow.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who has been active in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons, which are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police and directly from the police's criminal prosecution authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons are derived from military weapons.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover the lack of weapons," says the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also made a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stop international competition and that is why the weapons are under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow, to worsen," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the fog.
Especially many guns and weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes handmade production and a mafia that organizes the fog," explains former military personnel.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was produced by the Problem Analysis and State Administration Centre.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons are derived from the military and the law enforcement authorities, according to the investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the "spouse of responsible persons who have reached out to do their work with weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to animal sizes in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a weapon shop that does not want to be named specifically ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations are not purchased for long since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to provide the after-supply in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT-type gun, is bought over a Fännrich.
The gun is exposed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything about the decision, and therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for detection of crimes, periodically purchases control in traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury store."
Buyers and sellers find each other the most often about acquaintances.
I had seen websites and blogs when someone paid attention to me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me who would take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only got there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To provide a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," the sales consultant says. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and meet with a code like "of Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth."
I'm even coming to some battles today about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the hammers just because he knows I'm not squeezing him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military-owned Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of 1990 as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schedules have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was recorded.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," recalls the military officer.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but he can try everything.
I buy as a potential customer not only, but also go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate," the expert describes the move.
Purchase from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No paper is needed or there are personal meetings.
"They only need the appropriate amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buying fighting guns or guns".
There users will enter your orders and ask questions.
Will it also be sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (verbal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," says the laconic demand of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase the weapons go to the service at the network.
People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in Siberia and can shed coal
Military Commentor and former Military Associate Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following schedule: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank machine.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasises that you can also empty out and come behind bars when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase the weapons go to the service at the network.
"People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and can shed coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms, experts are expected to calculate prices of between $100 and 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarrow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to half a month.
The weapon is issued in military weapons warehouses of medium-range watchers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offenders with illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices dropped by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers in the United States
Every fourth U.S. youth ever sits behind the box of Mc Donald's
In the past days, there have been massive protests in the USA against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to get worse or whether they will be back in the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several non-profit organisations on the left.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handouts.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and met with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group are low and middle incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and order of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forks or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests called for wage increases on "Black Friday" and expressed their concern that the contribution to the occupational health insurance has increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley argue that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're paying for pay now.
If Walmart would completely convert the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be compared to today's extra expenditures of only $12,39.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that there were only nine state-owned protests and they did not protect the company from any loss.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his shop from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashiers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the left-hand side of the Huffington Post, that "less than five" Walmart employees had reduced their work and the protest station was just another "pr-trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart's affiliates (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore not yet existing), but were McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of shares, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York law is 7.25 dollars per hour.
In Fast-Food Restaurants, the minimum wage is raised after and after, however, not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
I don't understand how it is possible to get out of New York with so little money.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind McDonald's school, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
One could hardly see the main source of income or plant to stay there longer.
Now, I have interviews with McDonald's permanent staff who complain that they have to come out with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum of $15 an hour, which is more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company, the pursuit of this goal, and the removal or expulsion of trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff flow.
Unsaturated
This day there were loud protests before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting in the middle of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, among them council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of shares, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US Fast Food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, of whom at Wiitem not all are employed in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the function of these protests will mobilize all masses.
"The brain can only be easily overlisted so far"
The theme of the extended reality, popular with modern technologies, is seen in recent times usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented a functioning model in summer at his annual conference, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In a conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were just a transition station.
It drives the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with only hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly which research your group operates.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained mostly stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens that are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What's still ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment, is recognized.
Then we could supplement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this polluted virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think of language control?
She's popular, but she's not overrated?
- It is certainly not the solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about his actions and intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with computers is good, however, each in its specific niche.
For example, in the area of managing objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experienced with short and short, rather than out-of-charge gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by an armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of an armband watch.
However, in general, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray dose?
They say it and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- That's what you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that next time we will have to work on developing new types of sensors, which will allow us to learn more about people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it lacking in resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the Z axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are said to be extremely dynamic and open, the present 30 fps are too small for gestures.
Stephen Betshees developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly one device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera intentions to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- When I remember correctly, Microsoft presented his glasses to the public instead of Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of extended reality, the glasses have the best prospects in everyday life?
- Of course, it's not nice to keep a smartphone in the high hand on the road, but I think the most amazing option would be an "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there lies their strength (privates can only see you), but also their weakness, because an expanded reality through glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a long time that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but normal mortals are also available.
There is a problem that often points to critics of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection sub-item.
She's got great pressure!
However, there are technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" a little handhold, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling, which is still as weak as someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the hand joint that affect the nerve transmissions in the fingers, and that is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to list the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will still have to fight for, namely to let a person physically in a closed room believe, he is in an open, practically endless space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be easily overlisted, and many years of work are still ahead of us.
This is what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to the inhabitants of the city who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the list read, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Art scene, whose success goes beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bears dressed in red, which you meet at the Russian museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or on skirmishes.
Where the pictures of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social-philosophical artists in Petersburg who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and provides them with a good wage.
Before long, he took a Dreworgel and became Petersburg's Dreworgel player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's personality, philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer, which sits out with the optics and the image.
In this world, the red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society everything that deviates from the Graunorm calls for aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my proverbs.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters went to the end at that time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I associated myself with the paintings of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina" from which "Puchkinskaja 10" was born, and then was just finished.
It draws me to the theater, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg's culture where the best creative artists should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical-artist club for the Boheme house of the Petersburg Boheme until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I remember also how Schnur and his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore tight tricotts and also included the composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became from its Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs prior to the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his big career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the Art Clinic.
There our employees and family guests went.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In the year 2000, there was an inquiry into the press about the award of "the personality of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an undetectable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly convey the modernity and strength of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be so.
In a clown, it's confusing everything and losing its tragedy.
I love the Grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by predicting that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone looks at the dress and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should kick him in the face.
The deception disappears through the clothing.
Soon we saw you in the role of the city's Dragon Player, a cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice, too?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and funny.
We see the collapse of cultures.
Earlier the people formed great groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 adherents.
- But several thousand come to the events of Stas Michailow!
- Women left to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes on.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I painted images of a collector who even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and denied money to paint.
That's the culture I'm in favour of.
Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with real Zarens because the Zarans may not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they will be blocked because they need higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the first and free them.
Now it's only the taste of it.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must therefore seek other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable nutrient.
On our rocks, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrient, because for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Born in the World Hall
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with Killer Starroid.
Caravans from spaceships with terrestrial residents are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can thrive in gravity or on the planet of replacement?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could inhabit at least hypothetically.
"In fact, Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are comparable to life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in large heights or in the orbit of Venus, so in all, it would be possible.
The question of reproduction in all was first dealt with in relation to the Flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of herbs raised in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent to the worldall to investigate how gravity affects the development of Embryos.
It develops a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the kitchen must be found; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Professor of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the kitchens are overrun by the wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely collapsed.
The kitchens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let the kitchen slip and then put the whole thing in, because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says about the damaged experiment with the kitchen in everything.
The last carnage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only contain the same species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into everything.
In principle, nothing was identified.
"This was just with the biosatelites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive movement.
In contrast to animals, man could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out by ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying to All for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereskowa.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our Mowe fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it exceed the space flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says the Watchman Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereskova, gave a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed works outside the space vehicle, bore a son.
However, there is still a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, in which after long flights everything went well and they got healthy growth.
"The more dangerous it is for flights to the Orbit itself," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the preparation of the flight.
Here in a state of swimming, the cosmonaut routines win for the work in the open space.
The water represents the insomnia.
Even when adult water feels pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyander testimony would deny that life in the country went up to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can then become easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical that from birth to first swimming just once 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says Marina Aksenowa, a baby swim teacher.
While for a newborn child, gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of insomnia, the abdominal and thigh muscles are formed very quickly and thus also decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, let's take care of this by means of birth control.
For example, birth could also take place in a special room to express the child.
"But what happens then?" says the not important question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling Earthquake, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in the orbit like an adult to train in a load suit.
He will simply lack what is essential for his life.
"This experiment, which we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled, a completely inappropriate person," says the head of the Institute of Bioethics for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the worldall is just theory.
Sometimes, however, it will be a reality when the inhabitants of the earth in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will be home to their descendants in all.
NKÚ-Chief: Control of the black system is denied due to policy debts
The Czech Republic, however, has good control bodies and appropriate laws in relation to public contracts, which fall within its scope.
In the conversation for Aktuální.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Office of the High Representative (Njöšchšchě controlní Úd, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied - and this is not the case in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German experts.
As a negative example of practice, he leads Prime Minister Petr Necza's attitude to the so-called "Black System".
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not harm entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come from the president, and the control office whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, in its activities," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Committee of Auditors, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of the two countries on public procurement were compared.
Why did you go to concrete?
This is a parallel test with which we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, it is the European legislation that determines how public procurement is to be carried out; it is based on national legislation; and finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. In general, the laws may even be a bit "stronger and more perfect", however, the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help to you? What happens to you from this project?
Such joint control could, in particular, help to stop us from constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and austerity thresholds if this seems to be not particularly positive.
Economics means to acquire a case at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal activities or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
It may even be that we charge the system in this way only with excessive "papercream", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant for the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college which is merely formed something else. However, in principle, both authorities are similar.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that there are these accounting courts in the individual federal countries - there is a difference between the German system and ours.
The BRH can only control federal resources, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds administered to us by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without any specific indication only slightly.
Is this perhaps because the testers are better there?
This certainly does not, but, as I say, I do not like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that also those countries that are a model for us have problems to fight.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, what was the significance of the novelization of the grant law for your authority, do you feel any effects already?
In view of the fact that this novel is only a short time in force, it has not yet worked out in our tests.
Since our checks are subsequently carried out, we must expect a certain delay here.
We have already seen the impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of non-economicity" and have examined and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here, the changes will have a bearing on itself, as thresholds have changed, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or will the system be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stringer" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the carrier (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are obliged to account for any non-compliance with the award law with respect to budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even harder?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let's say which way is not objective.
The Prime Minister said in a short time that the ODS would not charge businessmen with control of the so-called "Black System" - what exactly is that?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, it cannot simply come to the Government's office, and the office whose duty is now to control compliance with the law is to prevent its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do as if we were nothing.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain proceedings - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best offer only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what we lack in my view.
On the streets, single ice levels are ruled, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice levels.
Mostly, however, the roads are well guarded, with increased caution being offered.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the Karlsbad district, the streets were well-dried this morning, individually mastered snow and ice fields.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it is supposed to get somewhat warmer over the day.
In the region it is now no longer cut, and in the deeper heights only a thin snowboard remains.
However, on the slopes of the Erzberge there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district street watch, the sight was limited because of fog.
The R6 motorway and the transport routes of the first road class in the region are currently subject to unlimited restrictions.
For example, attention is paid to bridges on which the roads are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third class of roads, including the mountain roads, are possible.
However, on these roads, partial snowflakes are required or exhausted.
In particular, increased attention is therefore offered in the higher levels.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Böhmens there is a danger of ice spots, in higher locations and in the mountains, there is still an excellent snowfall in the streets, the road and motorway address is shared on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice spots, which can occur especially in higher positions in the Pardubice district.
In particular, it is possible to arrive on the roads of the second and third class of roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are treated chemically.
Schnee is located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Mountain of Orlicé Mountains.
An out-of-date snowshoe is located in highlands on the streets of the districts of Richnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the east, it is mostly sunny or hotter today, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the Pilsen district are well maintained today, but local attention is offered, and the road is to be adapted to the weather.
This is fresh in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has been cut before and the temperatures fall afterwards, it can come to ice level on the streets.
It is also to be reckoned with fog, but the vision will be improved in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district magistrates.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is advised by the road masters between the 80th and 131 kilometres.
The roads of the first class of roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can come to ice levels in half.
The roads of the second and third road class are wet, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible sections required.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
With snowflake, drivers today have to count, which are heading towards the heights in the Olomouc district.
After the use of electric vehicles, snowflake remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snowflakes forced the road masters to use, according to data provided by the road administration about 3 cm of snow.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the circle of Šumperk remain in the heights even the snowiest.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count towards Jeseník with snowmatch," said an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration today compared to the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to their statements, the streets are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are unrestricted, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In North Bohemia, road masters report a number of bad sections of roads.
In addition to several locations with snow or ice fields, the mountain street from Telnice to Knnínice is blocked in the Ústí n.K. district according to traffic police data.
The temperatures are also below zero, so snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the depths, especially south-east of the Böhmic Central Mountains, no problems have been reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported, in particular, from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The suspension of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to axles which were pressed from the snowboard to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think should take place in less than one month of the world's decline?
This is one of those disaster reports that we would like to start with people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's decline.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the decline of the world.
Can you present the project more closely to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts are held at the same time as 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert is about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally probably from me, then we developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's decline, but we also want to reflect with the public on how we once passed this world on to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key hangers against the world's decline, with which to buy via www.e-tap.cz we can also support people.
The tape The Tap Tap has also included the so-called Hymne against the world's decline with the title "World's decline" along with other interpreters.
Already today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will they also benefit from the concerts?
Of course, and quite to the end, it is assumed that everything is going on and that the world's going on...
The hymn is to be sung by all the interpreters at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the Hymns will be transferred live together in a direct switch from Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperate with both of you?
We also cooperate with other peoples of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the fact that we carry out many beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation and have fun.
What is the purpose of the release of the concerts against the decline of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studio, where we have been working with the Association Tap at the Jedlikka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlikka Institute are regularly assisted by readers who assist them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlikka Institute, a building is to be built in which we will then take up this project.
Several groups and interpreters appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to draw up a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
For more information, see www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" planned for the future?
For the first time in May, we will enter Prague Spring, and also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to associate this with the events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have already arrived in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be carried in the luggage room. Also, of course we have to carry a lot of tools and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always been without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were the longest, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks with accessibility in individual countries, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
On the other hand, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is alone in the city centre.
It is not even clear that a wheelchair driver is being offered, for example, on the lift.
Fortunately, there are also associations that are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what sense do we have to raise against the developed countries?
There's still a lot of things that we hang back...
However, it should be noted that improvement of the situation is still dependent on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with serious disabilities to move in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not uncommon that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events there, there we are a little ahead of us with the band The Tap Tap on the west!
Respect for the public and freedom of access is a matter, but only if important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to set up a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as an administrator at the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I'm a musician myself and also saxophone plays, I've established a music AG with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládźa Angelovic, is supposed to say something out of control.
But was the band known only in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also begun to be active for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in any sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be different.
In show business today, they often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, as everything new is carefully considered and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is, of course, compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not the only and abandoned beings we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop themselves if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities do something, this is not just progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as heard by many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also ask for some discipline.
This is, in my opinion, totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week's trial, they have to complete the preparation stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm will melt at many quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that really wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only the only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, and you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to be with us is always welcome.
Located on the day before the predicted World Cup, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
Events include: Incheba Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to the conclusion by live switch and it creates a common interpretation of the Hymne "World's decline" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre that is to be created in Prague under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlikka Institute. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, cards are available for sale in Bohemitic.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Organisation ESA as the twenty-second member of this space authority. Poland is thus the second member country from the former East bloc (according to the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space began freely much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos had been busy with space travel, which did not always come to an understanding.
I recall here, for example, the talk by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Enter into the Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the prize REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, because one of the craters was named after him on the lost side of the moon.
Already in 1925, a railway drive was built in Poland for which a rocket was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rockets should be used to start or to brake the drain.
The information to be provided is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with missiles.
The research was carried out by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents submitted, it is evident that research has been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted freely by the entry into force of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press, the design of a photo-electric hunting dragon originated by Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymcásowy Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space company (Polishe Towarizvo Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, where four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the 1951 International Space Federation, and in fact PTA was already a regular member in autumn 1956.
The following year, he became the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-President of the International Federation for Space.
He had been in this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in 1959 began in the Błūdów-Wuiste Flight Tests with the two-stage RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was introduced.
A successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 missile developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B above 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C above 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Force Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR Committee for Space Research in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court raised the law on non-profit works.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem once from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unscrupulous financial speculation.
Due to the large difference in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
In this sense, a state in which the manufacturer is trying to survive through the introduction of cheap goods in economic competition by "interference" in order to increase its market share and its profits.
This means, in a large sense, for most companies to sell their production abroad or to buy it in favour, or to give up their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and thus does not bear any responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure must be increased.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the businessmen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics in this place are superfluous.
The unbiased practice of private capital in individual economies creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to the legislation in force.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the private capital dictatorship, in particular in the wage sector.
This is one of the economic pressures of long-term unemployment, the other of which is the violation of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery orders for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for a few years.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wage that the State has to raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings of virtually all EU countries will no doubt go beyond the same state in which people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in their social level (as in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment will eventually flow to the country.
Here, of course, is the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains the same because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claimed that the State should not take part in its own economy with the capital, and that the plan economy is leading to economic disaster.
The private capital is firmly committed to its position that the State may not intervene in the economy.
However, we must ask ourselves whether private capital affects politics and thus affects the entire state in its own selfish sense or even attracts it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically all-powerful and modern lobby in all countries.
The result is a dubious situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which virtually everything is heavy, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State has no private finance, close to industry-related law firms with the drafting of bills.
These draft laws are then adopted on the Federal Day.
All violence then does not depend on the people as it announces the Western constitutions, but on strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation, as Appian describes in his work about the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeii': "The state has long been understood in disaster, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against fines, by illegal distortion of advantages or by stone and sword.
The corruption was unstoppable, and the people went with already purchased votes to vote" ... "People with character do not plead for officials, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this downturn" ... "I really began to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but then the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the one rule.
As it turns out, today's society is based, as in the ancient past, on the unfair preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the whole of society's interests.
From its very nature, private capital is not in a position to recognise and implement the benefit of the whole society.
The result, as it is today, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not try to achieve further reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the disproportionate liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the decline in these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, completely ignored.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the State's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there was no war," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is in these constantly returning waves of the death of the guilty and who is the victim; at last, the inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been born into the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence themselves.
I am about to open the reader's view behind the scenes, the view of who are the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East above all.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and from my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always those personalities themselves that determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who was leading their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must agree that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and its resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special one that could be described as the head of the Kraków (I don't know if anyone else is standing over them, but I don't shut this down) - the Rothschilds.
Many are not written about it.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to stop the connection of their name with high criminal acts, in which the strengthening of their power, the increase of their assets or both was always in the background.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage war or settle on them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the storm of Gaddafis only four, while Russia subsisted its central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (public) bank notes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Senator Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to declare the FED because of the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global lists of Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the resolution of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of recognition.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchy states of Europe, in particular the colonial rule of the United Kingdom, and the third war was intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (a number of such numbers would provide for their conveniences and luxury and would not also consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism here is nothing more than the precipice) and ultimately lead to the taking over of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After being able to trigger the First World War in Sarajevo through the murder of the Habsburg Thronfolger Ferdinand, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks' revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unwarranted capitalisation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Zaire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Power Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the banks allowed the policy to create a latent conflict situation by putting Germany under enormous war repairs; thus creating the prerequisites for poor masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only a strong enough leader who offered the debtors names and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the country of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take up the function of a fifth column and also take up the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as much as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (back to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews from Palestine; it came to the first clash with the neighbouring Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was now released from the chain where the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was according to plan, it was only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in resolving this war, the Jewish people will be like the victims of World War II in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you think only of how the people divided themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, where at the beginning of the year the goat of individuals and their efforts to achieve global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international banks in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascismist, loyal to the international banks, who is doing everything to prepare a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and where Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of the world's oil supply could lead to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In her presentation, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; whoever has understanding, let him overcome the number of the animals.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of demonstrator Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the release of the spoiled Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, who had held the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the chess overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position, in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime was intended to carry out the release of the hostages.
It was a difficult blow to call the United States, and the subsequent Fiasco, in the violent attempt to free the soul, only made things worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were conducted by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian voices.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the message was put in place, six ambassadors arrived.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagance story to discover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the drawing credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On one side, he is a realistic polythriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the Ocean's Eleven film.
As a result, the levels of mood change in the film - on one side the documentaries from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passports from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily overestimated, come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits on the table, on the office flurry, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career.
From a well-known actor, he has become a respected director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third play film after the Crimea No Child Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it's affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the local atmosphere was one of the features that removed the previous films from the standard Hollywood director.
Affleck, however, also proves this emotion in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the introductory sequence of the blast of the message is very impressive in its overview, yet it conveys the feeling of confusion and unforeseeableness, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect can also be seen in fictional scenes (the false film staff on a base in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director also had to contend with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film industry.
However, with the weak, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport is removed from a phoneat in America, or even the persecution trail on the highway, seem to be somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide flow, which is due to the necessity to show too much in action to too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film thus loses some power. It is a film that can be pursued with a certain interest and then swallow the design and the retro-style that is remembered by a 70-year-old thriller.
However, it is only difficult to awaken enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a certain piece of life to this day and as evidence of how the ideas of the almighty and omniscient secret services are transcended, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, decided to organise the competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to the most recent plan by the EU to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrick Naier, who is taking care of the organisation of this survey, compared to the newspaper Právo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women is found among the nominated absurdities.
To that end, women in life insurance benefit because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible contributions from the EU industry can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nadir said.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding mixing of bioethanol into naturally harmful fuels, the further prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer, only because it contains a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of honeycombs, because of which the egg was much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also collected the actual ban on the use of the term "butterupstrich" or the prohibition on the sale of conventional glaucoma.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Council often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently attempting to comply with the claims of Czech banks with veto-breeding).
Lobby's interest was also that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not have "crust anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been highlighted by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to a loss of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to air balloons, must be provided when selling, indicating that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was involved in an American study which, according to Air balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market rates.
Curious impact is also available at home
It is also quite absurd that a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the Greek theme and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the absurdities, the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus identified the highest level of food supplies, which could be found on the day of our EU accession to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the determined volume for mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for requests for funding.
These ideas were free not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are therefore disadvantaged that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission rejected the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding funds was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), which should be specifically concerned with funds for the establishment of funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, regulations in the Member States are easy to target criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve greater recognition, in the opinion of some experts.
A more serious problem is, in the opinion of these experts, the EU funding for projects, which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which has been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions to this country also call for the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "Olomucké trážky", the Inland Room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition returned to us by the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to be renamed "Tuzemák".
The term "rum" may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar cane.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the company of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipan or Parmaschinken also the Karlsbad Zwieback, Carpfen from Pohorelice and Třeboný, or the Saizer Hoppen.
With an EU brand, the pardubicer can breast-feed the liver or the hořicer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about me being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would run nowhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been embellished for 20 years, how the diet goes freely, while people are increasing taxes and the age of interest.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am over 40, and for that I am independent and partial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate you made it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
So don't you turn your voters back?
I've been telling me all along that I'm going to take the fight around the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I made this clear and said that I would run for the President's office if I were elected to the Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people swim in the button and in front of the TV, but that everyone who wants to change something.
To this end, the media who want to rob one of the honor and who want to confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would be a journalist or that I was a consultant by Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with a negative statement of assets of over 20 million crowns.
To do so, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to keep the guide free of charge, and this could be accomplished.
The problem is small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population on.
As an independent party leader, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in this House.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without any sidekicks and party icons.
Do you see yourself as a man in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-link thinking is totally irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
Instead, I publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm it by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get closer to.
This can be described as populism, but all the suggestions I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, only words remain.
And so you don't go far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other options.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the Presidents of the European Parliament to live on television to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors.
And the accused should then say, "Why do they deny this?"
A strong personality that refers to faults can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the President's direct choice, which was a merit of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything; therefore, I have talked to several known persons about whether they do not want to apply for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Janchura, who refused to work because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in trade with light heat oil.
My candidacy started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electors did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone have usually chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are therefore only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district councilmen.
Do you think about establishing your own party?
I have not thought about it yet, because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member, and I do not even have the money for it.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account, there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
Aston Martin was also a child's dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a 60 million asset and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't generate too much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are basically covered by my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live by the senator's level alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're still working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to get these activities back?
But this does not relate to the amount of the price.
As promised, I have partially withdrew my activities.
For example, my representative will be the managing director of the travel office in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
However, as President, I would like to set up my businesses in full.
You will find the full conversation in the Saturday issue of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in their head - for example, the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a bookshop for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is going voluntarily into one of these old-style libraries today, is it?
Spijkenen, a hardly-needed sleeping town in front of the Tower of Rotterdam, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000 population community shows the lowest rate of education in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, it was decided to contribute a few years ago to general education and to build up the seven fictitious bridges on the euroboards as well-prepared concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive remained within the limits.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become the statistics master: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, master of the magnificent Barken Diagrams and producer of wise, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with habitual integrity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under arm and a border in the face.
And while the jury was still suspected of looking around and rubbing with the axes, the fried Maas stacked his read-up armchairs of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist under-muttered speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenenes, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro teure mountain was shot.
It is part of a revitalization project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
As a result, the sightless small city resorts, which so far had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unmatched ugly town hall, would be suitable to assume a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, spies now have the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese lock.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the true room and reading delights come to an end when the topography takes place on foot.
The glassed interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floors and the elegant street floors speak unmistakably the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books.
"Normally, the book rules are standing along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have placed the classic room configuration on our head and the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used: in the middle of offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house engineering centres.
A special pleasure is the black book rule, which is sometimes wall dress, sometimes wedding, sometimes climbing countries.
Optics, Haptics and smells are strange.
Even inflexible architects and construction engineers will shield the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the City Municipality of Spijkenen, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a Frisian farm one day, we were hit by an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimetre of plastic was used as a root material in plants and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile contains, two seasons, then it is ripe for the spermulf.
For the library, the tiles - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four inches thick plates.
Under heat effects and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, load-efficient material that smells up to a new car and up to a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you are at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long hike, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the correct humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a preview project in ecology despite the many glass surfaces," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled with soil heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass hole, the sun itself seems only briefly inside in sunny days.
The broad wooden limbs, which stand all the way to the glass facade, serve as an estimate and capture most of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Complete the rest of the full automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already waiting for the way to the new bookstore.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, which is called the Boekenberg even as the "longest superfluous soul".
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
For the first time, the optical gaps in the uncompleted library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The regals are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semiconductor library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the earth.
This led MVRDV to succeed in the Royal Discipline, which is called the Fachjargon Identification Foundation.
Spijkenen wrote literary history.
So young and unimaginable she may be.
This is finally an approach point for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the adoption of the vote by Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, experts for US-European relations, Berlin thus balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin was born.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, however, without being overly critical of Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This was finally carried out by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to address a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows willingness to refer to positions of national interest which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are at a certain level different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests have an impact on the situation in the Middle East and on the UN's vote?
For one thing, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to stumble the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I would also not want to add too much weight to it, which is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it plays an important role in German discussions anyway.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by containing itself in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even take some respect for this.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States has made clear itself for a veto.
Are there differences in opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I think that the real differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to push things out of their own position instead.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role of an important international player - will Germany take over a major role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is still not accustomed to this, it is still unacceptable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, then every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Thus Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to different neighbors and opinions and this is not easy.
Now the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly taking off, but the EU does not fill this vacuum, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes them a lot more unpopular - c'est la vii!

"Market protection" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
What, though, is Armani Polo?
Below is an official name registered in China that, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in Fernos.
Every week, there's a new case on my desk.
The successors already have a few additional letters so they can register their brands.
So from Gucci it's just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports articles manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with trademark entries in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company there protected the brand Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion hall Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world masters are in copying and in corrupted spiritual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey shops that sell almost exclusively fakes.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his agents, he argues that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a companion brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
This means that women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is harmful, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is washed, the setting is gone, the image damage is huge."
Financial expenditure and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive precursors.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of double entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can go away, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court of Justice dismissed complaints because after the long term the name claimed became "marktreality".
If the complainant has Pech, he has to pay the plagiarism even because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are allowed to use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was broken, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against Nahammer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand name in Beijing suggests that in 2010 there were engpasses due to too low staff and room equipment.
In the past year, however, one was returned from the "notice situation in the workplace to normality".
Thus, the amount of unprocessed opposition procedures was reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 objections to deliverance are still pending in the office.
It costs a lot to go against
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This was a record and meant that China would start the list of new notifications throughout the world for the tenth time, the Authority will inform.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was charged.
This means that each application costs 1280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
On the other hand, it costs a variety of things, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese pest.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacture of imitation parts of motor vehicles was lifted.
However, the successor continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You have missed this because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO showed the opposition of the Munichs, as well.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly mentioned, the firm archive has had to look through hundreds of years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high six-digit euro" contribution.
"That's how much we value it," Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernost threaten to return to Europe.
That's when Imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long abandoned the group, although it was able to refuse registration.
"You have to be polite," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to leave behind international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "also sign up for anything that is of any value to protect in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you probably have to pay the opposite party license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are forced out of the market in the sector.
World Day: Stamps, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland Aydwaisen are happy about it.
The history of a connection that goes far beyond 8733 kilometers.
First of all, the stamping is: Cowboystubel, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for the touch on the parking floor, and they'll find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Only then did the voices of the singers slow down - age, bass, tenor, and soprano - tire out, bother, and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, has it almost out of his fabric shoes when he brings her together with his ridiculous wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music cry of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifteen singers and singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, came from the human geneticist to the household.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each body voice has another text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-financing
There are about 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which appreciates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS victims live.
More than 40 percent of the population are currently HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS waisen in the village of Esiteni, the Association Voices for Africa Paten has been found in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 Euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantus language can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the Chor Lieder has been practicing in this foreign soft language and brings her back to where she originally came from: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres of Heidelberg Airline, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leather and straw hats, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are exposed to the HI virus.
In Eiteni there is evidence in the small area where the whole of Swaziland is sick: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
A reduction in the risk of accumulation by half is unlikely to be accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying with 30 percent is no rare.
During a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, where there was not only a lack of parental care, but it was easy on everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leave, there is no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a few euros a child to school a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which since then has taken care of the AIDS pathways in Eisitni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, Chlamydine and Tripper (Gonorrhö) are included in the bacterial STI.
Common viral STI are HIV, human papillomavir, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzleuse and herbs are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamyden infections, Trichomonades, Candidose (Pilz), Tripper and Human Pappylomavir are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - however: around 20 percent of HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
After European surveys, three quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15-25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common in young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute of Diseases in 2001, the number of Syphilis infections increased by more than double the number of diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has risen since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a gender disorder?
Infectious diseases can cause joints in the genital area, complaints in urinating, rash, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of a strain, but do not offer a 100% protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by fungal infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can heal most STI and avoid consequences.
Because of patents, donations, and not least the tires that the chorus takes place throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 20 000 euros to Esiteni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the well-being of the cows, for example at one of the great mothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 cows with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms on time every day for school education.
Anyone who has no one else comes into the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association just like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has called a nearby school into life, built two chicken houses and organized PSI together with the American health organization, that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-intelligible, because so obviously the disease is also throughout the country, one tends to lose it in the best way.
A King With 14 Wifes
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Schwarzafricas, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Let's compare it to democracy.
Among other things, it is also responsible for this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are barely used.
Culture is another - flash to flash."
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of wehmuth, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many have known at the southern tip of the Black continent since the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings excitement and joy, but has already cut off some violent border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esiteni, where the singers visit their children.
Even if you barely find the small village on maps, it is more known in the valley of the Ezulweni river.
"Go to Esiteni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 km air line to Heidelberg, to the springing singer in the sample room on the mountainheim street, you will also see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice deck may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the sun is next, there is also frozen water, as from three studies published in the "Science" magazine on Thursday.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is a ice cover in the planet’s permanent shadow region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that are hit on the mercury.
No one connects the find of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have been reached in other parts of the solar system.
Unaware of the earth’s citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in endless ranges.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the two-planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who crosses the sun behind Neptune, Ceres, after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 is not "Planet".
This video section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, the pink "newborn" are more difficult to identify in the star court.
This star-shaped region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the Telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This brilliant glint of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that exhaled the star in the process of death.
In the huge trifid cloud, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The peak telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades starhouse, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the eye only at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors better apply.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo against the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos ensures the spectacular coloring.
This babyster could only be recorded in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared undetected 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies will become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the trifid cloud in the star image, which is thousands of light years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (tried, split), as dark dust strips trite the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the prepositions of a cosmic carambo: 400 million light years away from the earth, the nucleus of two intermixing galaxies has raced together and will inevitably collapse.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
The technical cut-offs are not allowed to refer to the southern wheel when they are marked.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an extract from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for the NASA.
The largest spiral galaxy is called the UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way is located in this constellation.
The star height always produces new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, connected to the Rosette Nebula, are emerging new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers assume that he was born shortly after the urn, when the universe was finding a major hydrogen.
Our insights into everything: The most important telescopes
The telescope was designed by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasingly larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Palomar Observatory was the world's largest remotest tube near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Long Binocular Telescope stands.
It lets look into all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Grand Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the good construction methods: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its speciality: the high amount of light.
This is enough - despite relatively low mirror diameter - to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to all of them according to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help any computer owner by providing computing.
Look at the Observatory of the European Star War (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes all the honors for his name.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the central infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to cover up to 42 meters - and to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But with pictures it is the earliest to count 2018.
By 2007 the two Keck Telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors at the same time with each average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea observatory, which next to them is the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
On the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope will be created - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the main impressions from the All deliver the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly for those who are resident.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last initial preparations at the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot to the ground by early 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary level of the world-wide infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on the mercury.
The Messenger Sound launched in 2004 - the first to cross around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and will be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The trip through the Talysch-Geberg is wildly named.
The small bus flows across the curved street, past densely forested hills, rising rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything is green and sweet, you might think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian group of the Talysians lives, from which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very long-lived.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is easy with too vast architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is just lonely.
The tangible wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the right to a tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life of about eight dozen Italians from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child is born
But the controversial star of the museum is the Schafhirte Şirali Müslümov, who should have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears to be extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805 in the region, 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explained.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he should have witnessed to another daughter.
So Şarali Müslümov calculated at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been among the high-level students in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan, many highly respected people are also present," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are very many very old men."
However, due to lack of evidence, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially lack of a personal record.
Every day, definitely sucked butter
The fact is, however, that people in the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why live here in the south so many highlands?
The Asian tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
On the other hand, museum director Fatulayeva believes that there is food.
But that calculated the caloric cost of the talyses should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and especially milk products, and from which many drink a glass-flavoured butter daily, from a nutritional point of view it is not even plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple woodhouse, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a buttock, which she uneasyly rolls up and down.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are the longest grandparents.
Two little kids also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, built-in Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in line and clay, under her head she hides long, dark-blown pockets, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I've never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly Interest Enough for Life
She has always only eaten what came from her own garden, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
I haven't bought food in a single time in the supermarket for my whole life.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the time after World War II.
But everything was better than the "loving father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rust.
The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows the boundaries of Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later took over his son Ilham the Ruder.
There is no need under Azerbaijanis Alten.
230 Manat (like the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as an interest, an amount from which you can live well for these conditions.
And maybe Mirzayeva's dearest son is right for a long time: "The old enjoy our culture of respect."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing customers in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian President did not spare Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds, is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian leaders, the liberals, the clarified Muslims and secularists.
Because they all, so far hopelessly clash in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of the graces of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He has, as Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "rescue the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who wears a doctoral title at the U.S. University of South California, really wants to save himself, about which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the action is enabled.
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been consumed in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerit, are partly concerned by the Islamic-dominated 100-headed constitutional assembly.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in the draft, which is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal space for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This brings together at least a new article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University should be drawn up, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiation power in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that spirituality oversees the legislation, which would de facto lead to the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
It is also problematic: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the coup of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were put in military custody.
The state should also, in the draft, "the true essence of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values".
This is so legally formulated that state institutions could control even the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In Putuxt, that means nothing but censorship.
No article specifically spells out the equality of men and women.
For this purpose another prophet, Muhammad and his messengers, is forbidden to torment or to torment.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Also dubios encourages the formulation that is prohibited from "suffering people".
Does the President have a cartoon or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
As much as in the draft, which Mursi is present for signature and is "very soon" presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the domination of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual entrance on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter into effect before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbai, third-stakeholder of the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution belonged to "the Müllberg of History".
Through short notice service Twitter he visited the supporters of Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crush him," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not healthy yet," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood, on the other hand, became a counter-test, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried out: "The people call for the application of the law of God."
They demanded of Mursi, "Son of the land!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle about the height over the symbolic Tahrir-place, on which all its beginnings took place, would have claimed civil war conditions.
Mursis's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained, both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had made themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the election course in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights doesn't even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone down to February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and head of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
For this he was reproved, condemned, imprisoned.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in his discussion with the World on Sunday.
Mursi's extension of power to all three of the state's powers allowed the lawyer to be re-registered.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it aside," said Saeda.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels lonely, including from the international community, who considers the ideological battle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a joke.
A demonstration on Tahrir warns: "You give a monster you can't control anymore."
Fishing from Norway: Is this the most dangerous fish in the world?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of life - and not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite for quite harmful fish?
You take a selection of too many cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And she's been there for a week.
So close to this, you have to imagine the nascent smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this harsh smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-stained forage, which - depending on how you would like to smell its fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norway flows to a feast here in Fagernes, which, now, is truly a very excellent speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
To us, people consume small fish vegetables and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
"People like the Aquavit more than the fish," says Havard.
The spirit can force the smell.
I'll take a few hippies.
If you avoid bringing the fish to the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poor Norwegian epoch, when there were no refrigerations yet and fish was drunk in the autumn in air-resistant saltwater fibers.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after long fermentation and, no doubt, consumed with alcohol-flavoured senses.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and to go to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, angelsed by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not far richer than Norway long ago, flows immigrants.
Rakfish is considered to be something important - as an essential, even strictly richer part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive courts you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 Euro.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to interrupt it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist law extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "Event of July 22".
Norway is hard to accept that someone in its peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our cell girl, who distributes round tablets with raffim fish and with her long blond hair and the striking blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We're a -- as we say -- careful people.
Her English is just like most people here are homeless.
We're not very polite, we don't like dirt.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the sector's revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing money around, which they did not even possess, Norway kept its money exchange firmly closed.
"If we can walk in the winter ski and walk in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And of course eat rake fish," she adds with unsweetened laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an Elch-Burger is something else at all times.
But in the evening, the fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I'm staying is one of several venues that organize a fish dinner, with guests who can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a showmaster dressed with flying, surrounded by counters with rackfish.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquarium.
But maybe it's the strict dent of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares himself at his office, Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days, this is a always hidden city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built that shuts down several important traffic routes into the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt pendants on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's pledge and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's faced with a complex task.
Under the separate government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been economically viable, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama early this week at the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went up with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A Direct Man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo you can remember him.
Citizens of the resort write to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can ride on one of the highways that had Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement towards the fragile, helpful roads that once existed here.
The posters with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressor for the party Pena Niitos, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera adds that the party, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto.
The drafts of the opposition, the new president is missing substance, he rejects it.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot in Brachland near a large millet ponie, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the time of Governor Pena Nieto's office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpassed the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is reported to innocent women for their violence and murder.
Critics Pena Niitos are of the opinion that he has at least not dealt with the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the downside district, Irinea Buendia fights the tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana started suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life-threatening.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. There is a cross that bears a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, you've been defending her so far.
The authorities treated me as a wet, restless, blind.
You want to just accept her judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many forms and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's pledge on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn into compassion in the last six years of violence, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope, as President, he is like he was governor," says Prime Minister Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza feared the most.
The Public Prosecutor claimed: Bradley Manning did not complain about mishandling
The Public Prosecutor rejects Bradley Mannings' proposals if he has been treated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to dismiss the charge on account of harsh conditions of detention
The release of the US army is proposed to have disbanded thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in the US history - had failed several opportunities to complain about his alleged misconduct in military.
During a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained to Maj. Ashden Fine that documents on weekly visits to prisons during Mannings' nine-month prison time in Quantico, Virginia did not show any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following an application for a defence to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been punished by the hard prison time - Manning had said he would have considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army Secret Service Analysis, which was arrested in June 2010, is proposed, while its service time has stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his prison in Quantico military prison, where he had been under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning added that he had considered the treatment through his wakes as "excellent" and the treatment through the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about maltreatment, although the officials had directly asked for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had voiced his concerns and the officials had discussed them with him and told him to deal with them. However, they were not registered.
"They wrote (after consideration of concerns) "No problems", and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, which should examine the thoughts mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to step down his observation status for "prevention of injuries".
The military said that he had been assigned this restrictive status - which is a level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to release the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and detention in Kuwait, where he was detained for about two months before he was transferred to the port of Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and became unconscious because of the heat.
Do not know what happened to him or to the outside world, be burdensome.
"My world collapsed on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He's only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just to lie down.
Instead, he had to sleep with light, which moved from the outside into his cell.
If he turned at night and couldn't see his face anymore, he was awakened to return.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer filed a formal objection to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said that during this count he had never had the opportunity to meet his roof.
On Friday's question, Manning stated that he had concluded from a command of his watch that he should have let the blanket with which he could have covered himself fall. However, he said that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked last night. He had previously tried to show an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the alliance of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
On this night, as Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and reduce his sentence dramatically, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is set up for the beginning of next year.
The defense stated that Manning would be less guilty of guilt, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme should be prosecuted.
The continuation of the hearing is set for this weekend, and a justification of the prison conditions is expected from the Public Prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been determined in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security provisions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life-long prison sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunity
Mexicans tend to accuse immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check, when the lack of counseling was taking place in me.
Paintings refer to two waiting strings: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), one for "Extranjeros" ("Exterland").
I've been there for a few seconds, uncertain who I should be.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mexicans".
An ethnic curly - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shorts or strips.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I'm not going to leave my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda contained all those topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans to stay in Mexico with equally high probability today, instead of moving to the United States.
He would like to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block as the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even if he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resensitivity.
Most Americans are probably never missing a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country to leave them more than half of its territory under the ongoing threat.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official is doing the mildest criticism in Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complains about how the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the path of war.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge lies in the truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you like to talk about resensitivity?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or parent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and extended to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust is in them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes faded, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a pattern of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families weren't spared in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not now be caught behind the silk screen - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally introduced as a child into the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this bad for them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we'll be seen as Mexicans.
As I was supposed to learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education citizenship want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional ambassadors for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
No, I don't.
It won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unresolved corruption and drug violence, many of us are not even so sure that it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it yourself, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico for half a century ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in the way their family members were treated not long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Fights, New Near East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the Keim.
In the midst of the usual debt statements, countless buildings were placed in protection and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of which killed civilians, and six Israelis, and for the first time rockets from Gaza were shot near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians appear to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons for the assumption that the deadly patch situation could finally end it.
A War That Will Not Be Lost or Winned
At first glance, optimism seems to be different from that of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, these weekly fights have strengthened the hearts of the people on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claiming to have pushed Israel back, although its group itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are trapped in one of the most isolated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a re-energizing, regional power that once regarded as Israel's strongest Muslim allies, has taken over the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
The jealous Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamic half-moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic predominating Bashar Assads could stand before the destruction of Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the largest and most important Arab country at a distance - on the southern flag of Israel has changed the balance of the region in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his turn in 2011, had only little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be expelled from Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have a counter-legislative conclusion.
The Hamas are no longer at risk in military terms.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains unswervingly in its position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence.
In recent years, Israel has been well received, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide killers - not least thanks to the suspensions that have taken place in the West Bank and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party has joined an even more fighting group in the pre-elections on January 22nd under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these post-list Palestinians also hesitate and leave a state for them?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not then fire rockets just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry out, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Israeli defence situation is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to maintain their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi and Barack Obama are meeting to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking decisive steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be robbed of their own right to self-determination - a powder-covering that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to repress the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasingly calling for their diplomatic tributary over the years.
Both sides need an attack from outside
The right answer is the one that will be represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the vast majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two countries where Israel is a member of the security sector.
The hope for the near future is that the ceasefire outside gives more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, now has to stop the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the borders of 1967, complemented by territory exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than with the request for a UN observer status.
Also, Obama must contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he neglected the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he would also be inclined to participate.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
This is part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packages equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This will replace brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green blankets, which are also printed with dramatic images showing sick parts of the body and children affected by cigarette smoking.
From the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small letters is observed from Saturday.
As a result, Australia introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to get young people out of smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who haven't started with 26 are not going to start smoking with 99% probability after that.
"You can see in children young people that they understand the message that tobacco groups are trying to apply with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of the multinational groups, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco club fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was stated that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
On the other hand, others say that the laws have strained their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicon tyres has increased enormously to cover the inconvenient packages, since the British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco were defeated two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court with its enforcement of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale shops and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hacks are in the popularity of social media in exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, it prevents them from appearing as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to put cigarettes in shops no longer. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and has only one area left to apply for his products does not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by "full normal people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds so big cases of Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain of unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries engage in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws will be considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokers show up despite.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and throw away the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, a tobacco dealer "King of the Pack" in Sydney's city centre, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his regalia.
"I used to need an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government would have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's what we're doing," he added visually.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to even be tired
I spent five hours of this thanks when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts for me to rest.
I don't want to lie.
One and a half days at the airport waiting for a flight is rather nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead long periods of time as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may contribute to creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, we no longer benefit from the benefits of the ages.
So should we welcome the length of time with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back for that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that long-term is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't look that way.
"In fact, the ages have a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii are a Latin graffiti over long periods, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we actually define the length of time.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that time has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that for a long time, they were able to define themselves as "to want to pursue a satisfying activity, but not to be able to do so".
For a long time, it is different from Apathy because the person is not busy, but it wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do something about apathy.
The key experience of the length of time, he says, consists of a "disturbing the attention process, paired with bad laune and the feeling that the time is just passing slowly".
For a long time, this can be almost as much heard as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be related, long-term people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only difficulty concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to Germany for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of longevity in the aspect of attention," which appeared in the September journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", points out Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to an earlier experiment that belonged to a band where a person had a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not even hear these sounds.
The people who had barely heard the television reported that they had more time to try than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating on themselves, could not find any reason for this and wrote down their difficulties of time.
If you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, the disruption of attention can lead to a long time, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are engaged in a unique activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can break down and help you not feel tired".
In fact, as he says, we now know that hermits and critzels, often interpreted as signs for long periods of time, can even fight by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to go around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored once - my slow flight, a dreary speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale to long-termity".
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys often become boring as girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external travel.
But in general teenagers are a rather relaxed herd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that involved nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the adults in the school and at the time of the homework were long-term, while 23% indicated that they were long-term if they were not in the school.
But only 3% of the parents gave up feeling tired.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have increased or decreased with regard to the length of time.
However, he was sure that "youth will be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily life.
So back to my question of origin: Is longevity healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the game of luck or drugs to relieve them - that has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With the length of time, the brain wants to tell someone that something else should be done," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide short-term happiness, but they run away long-term again.
So whoever has an iPad for his adult child can take it away from the long-term. However, it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: " self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain but also to receive more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate for a while.
We should also not view them as too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel well beyond the constant activity and technology distribution.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be more boring. But for a long time it is the annoying, unbending desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to relax and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it's hard to deal with when the noise is gone."
In Colorado there is no clear guide for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year-old Community College student and footballer Anthony Orozco stands in South-East Colorado for a trial that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana fractures and a pipe with which he smoked.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drugs - cavalry delicacy, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the weeks after the State's decision to legalise small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of small drug addicts depends less on the law than on the location.
There are hundreds of oppositions to the order that are turning around in Marihuana, here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities do not pursue adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is lawfully allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing Marihuanadelicts continue to be prosecuted and still cite people before the court.
At the same time, several cities, from the capitals of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana shops from opening up their communities.
"This situation continues so fast that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington crash in the head.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, sale and sale of drugs - and have a period of up to 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is the view that Colorado is in any case preemptive to most states as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then self-consuming.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. The state is therefore well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spiritists in the State of Washington.
But Smith also adds that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he added.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a grey zone where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state provision of "accepted access" to licensed Marihuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis business within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Wherever it will be harder to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the ballet area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelicts in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not "at once" seek criminal representations for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations to regulate farmers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of Marihuana before the court, although many have also been accused of other dealings.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations at which it was a crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
This decision was supported by District Attorney Pete Hautzinger, but it also decided not to allow all the pending property procedures to fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time doing the right thing until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the country among local officials promoted a deep-seated twins with regard to the large green experiment for days.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents Marihuanadelikt in court and acts on the spot as spokesman for the national organization for the reform of Marihuanage.
"They have spent such a large part of their life pursuing people criminally so that they can still not accept the legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries to treat the smaller amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as a national case for the legalization of drugs.
While preparing for an age of legal sales by the public and public authorities, they also look forward to the instructions of the federal government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at the federal level as a penalty.
Advocates of the Legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be informed.
Despite several prominent arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to be largely.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy advisor, is the view that criminal officials will probably not enter the doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, but will probably be pushed to cover the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved Moratorium for new Marihuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose decided, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We are looking at what the community has decided on and not what the state has decided on.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was called from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
It's always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once considered to be the world's greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus led the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that Comilitons had sex in the adjacent room.
Author A N Wilson skelled, I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I'm gone.
Yes, I did, because I was under systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was only shocked for one reason - a reason that in this alleged wave of enlightenment seemed to be so much more intense and cruel: My now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I am a supporter of the conservative party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same protection of equal rights, the benefit of schools, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views".
They request a place in the Committee on Equal Rights of their College to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Its situation has been aggravated by a recently released documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories represented as an eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it was shown by the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and wearing silver-colored suit and silver-possible crockery.
In other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sin books for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Association of Students at Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link to universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without getting to know us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a historian in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unacceptable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, said she observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights in JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly scary 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had agreed not to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to the shortness of high school education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students and the tutors met, I got a taste for future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only held back the rejection of Tory students, but even shared in it with joy.
Political issues such as mountain workers' careers, privatization and rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden spaces of the tutorial.
At my first meeting, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I was not included in what should then come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was staring at it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and quite shy.
"Do those followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kooked.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt said.
I came back with my head hanging in my room.
On this evening, I sat alone at the college when someone pointed me slightly to the shoulder.
It was a second year English student named James, who was a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is coming, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory-First semesters suggest being a supporter of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried to replace myself later.
I was aware that I wasn't at all with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics who had ironically visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was stupid and stupid.
"Who's Tories Sex?" asked one.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I join the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years before me, my spiritual eyes turned to a fiery fire of brass and insulation.
The only tutor to openly identify himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher about foreign policy and had written for her.
He was just rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and petty and rejected it for its Marxist-Deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professor's degree at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started hanging between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfaithful.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said little.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always put the day on no objectionable manners.
His moist eyes were troubled.
Give the whole man a chance.
I'm sure you don't.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exploited by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, as well as Tory's followers, had given up the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I went into hiding from shame, I admitted that my parents had brought me into a brainwash, and she called me "old trottel".
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my masters gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a winey sleeper.
But no 18-year-olds should ever suffer from such intimidation and evilness in an educational institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino advocates elegance of popularity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC tells Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion company.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worth hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothing of the skin Couture, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always sought fascination for the sticky and distant world of the Adel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will still be seen by 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most widely read aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, via the Princess Marie-chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
In the Adel, being in love does not have to be harmful.
"At least they don't come out on your wonderful carpet, as it does some beautiful sights from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, very fond of forgotten beauty, such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always had the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he recognized and felt his influence.
"All visitors felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began its career at the week of the Haute Couture in 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes..
View of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of adultery, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long walk that proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walk to admire a dreamy "audibility", the masterpieces of Valentino wears, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion buds broadcast names such as Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgarien or Sofia von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a hat, a shirt, a west type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I attract him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I like the colors he uses, very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also, the princess and leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovamapaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she brought a Valentine.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in the castle of my veteran, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped top with a decolette that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his occupation is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg maintains her evening clothes of the fashioner "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Mode
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were needed to produce this ivory-colored silk suit with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half meter long swivel.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the upper society".
For years with the "savor-estre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Art et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary legion, garavani cumulates as many honors as any of the owners of his customers.
"I am always his refining, his calmness, his respectable and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg adds.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was useless; time leaves no trace of him."
And that's what a princess says...
The world's most difficult occupation: the human labour animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sweat over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people whose work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sweats from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
To that end, he must climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the earth's floating gas becomes stuck in contact with the air.
After breaking out large swivel stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the drained path of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the shield-krafting pump, while they must keep the balance and take their steps carefully so that they do not dissipate and collapse.
You know that every step can cost your life, as this happened to a French tourist who crashed on the Kawah Ijen partitions years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of silk that they decompose.
On arrival, they turn the way between the tourists who photograph them like circuses and run with the weary heavy bodies three kilometers to the weighing, which a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (no better said) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sweat.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is widely distributed throughout the day and is used for the production of straw wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3,8 Euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
At the end of the day, he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What seems to be a miserable reward for such an inhuman effort, but the triple is what he would earn with the fieldwork.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a waller on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anton returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sweat: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
And asthma, breathing with difficulty, often coughs and his eyes are swollen because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anton has been playing his life on Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
And asthma, breathing with difficulty, often domesticated, and his eyes are cut out of the volcano because of the toxic gas.
This is the price he must pay for reaching his dream.
"I will be working here for two more years because I want to open a load or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-stricken young man could work as a tourist leader, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning for two hours because the sweat also flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
Challenged by the shadows, he rises in the light of a small starlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 carriers load the body with sweat on their shoulders on the floor of the crater.
Despite its great achievements, the mining company has not mechanized the construction of the swimming pool to save costs, and delivers no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 Euros) per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euros) of the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human transport.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues to "saling" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sweat burns the throat and swallows the eyes, when the wind turns suddenly and the miners enter the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have been shaped by the weight of the body.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his passengers break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which is transported by three LKWs across a path between the bay to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, who opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a swimmer.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation on to generation in one of the hardest occupations in the world: those who work as human cargo at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for not having children, for their careers, for their stress and for the cost of property and for raising children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizens' duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a advertising for Minzbons, but yet - or just because - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local languages such as "Sweet will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising firm, which has turned the video, sees the hope that the advertising site will reach a funny way to pay attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were growing up, we were the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a matter of taking care of ourselves.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organization of Speed-Dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?

Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Each year it spends $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its government and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the rate of replacement - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Authority's marriage and family policy, says that this is due to "better education" and "larger career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to marry other than a family to have much more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social situation have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the increase in the population and births, the result of which is the reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in migration in order to counter the reduction of the population led to residences in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cassed xenophobic flowers against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequence
While the drop in birth rates has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as the "showcases" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they scare the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says that his "schachatelles" are much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold faster in days and even weeks than the larger housing units.
This leads to the fact that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, it adds that the new standards give the developers clear directions that had previously been put in place if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district should be understood to have no major effect.
"The people are very anxious, the apartments and even the education are expensive, so it's out of the way of many," says one young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That's why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting kids - where the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "the area of private life where you have a claim for protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied on its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses if he announces on the Internet situations he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the network.
In four cases they linked the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user", when they used it on the social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't let me know in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not from me, or from someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is making it clear that it is wrong to publish evil pictures, from naked people, from crimes, or to write political or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them is the mother who has the password for one of the accounts.
I reported on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'll just charge them up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his buddy list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any statements to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone bothers me or demands it from me, I just remove it from my user account" he adds.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not familiar with the experiences you know today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was pushed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who he was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only made it private."
After that, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, these young people would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to take him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Encipherment
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with high school in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be published, published or said, and this at an age where the tires are not sufficient."
"They should also be selective when it is their most important thing to be loved to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is to ask them what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then lists some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like what you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission if you have labeled photos of holidays?
And another question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
These are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Esturdo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the social network guidelines.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven governments in existence.
Efé repeated his attempt to gain access to the signed document at the VIth regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's Office were first informed that they would pass it on to the Klausur, but then explained that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian Government's website.
On questions about the text, they stated that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit meeting was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the President's meeting without tone was transmitted in the press room with the announcement of "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by the press speakers from some of the governments of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discontent among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, who demanded more information.
The president of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala, not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
In the past October, Peru was the host of the IIIth Summit in South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a pressing call from the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had been announced earlier, was also not yet published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that there would be information systems for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which constitutes a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which began on Monday in The Hague, in the process that started the Lima against Santiago, to listen to the petitioners on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently making with this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Cile was, is and continues to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñara adds, and welcomed Humala with a handprint in front of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia had taken a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it felt was a serious mistake to file a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 from the appointment of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The State chief left the final document, which reported that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set up over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
He said of the decisions taken, that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be put forward to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "Economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant moves, but should serve to extend our production performance and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ...and thus to unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-only statement.
Among these projects, there would be five Peruvians who are located on the shoreline of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also took into account the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect for a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusively, and also the Nicaragua Agreement will require talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be civilized and treated as respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intended to be present when the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, took office.
As part of the summit meeting, the Minister of Defence of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which would strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "extended in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "are today practically a father country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the spirit community, must be corrected; however, there are still more reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
President Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the terms of reducing the influence of the German states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and on the contrary, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is understandable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he declared as an appeal to the political asylum that Ecuador gave to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision, because he did not give up his principles, but to abide by his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time "there was reasonable suspicions that Assange was delivering to a third country and would not comply with its procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice he demanded of him to be interviewed in his country because of a alleged sexual delinquency, while "Swedish law allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted through the ecuadors message in London."
Correa explained that the risk was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I haven't talked to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot carry out physical exercises in the open.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum, the Assange was granted since June in the ecuadors Embassy in London, that it was a free letter that enabled him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founders of WikiLeaks.
We do not act on human rights, we do not apply this word in this case, however, there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures to various European institutions," he explained.
And "If the UK gives this letter tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden heard Mr. Assange on the ecuadors message in London or via Skype, how the Swedish case-law was allowed and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the mediocreness, the evil intent and the lies that deduce the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for and press for profit," he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador was no longer ruled by such journalists as "and also not ruled by bankers or hegemonic and state-of-the-art countries", and took the lead in a re-election "the revolution will deepen to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organization "must remain and no opportunism and no rule of law can be held," because "the legitimacy of democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos, now and according to the judgement of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime state of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be thoroughly treated so that you can overcome them and look forward to them.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime disputes between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and felt that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries are obliged to take the decision, even if it is very hard to do so."
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost his election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to meet this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today took part in Lima on the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death because of AIDS is too late today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb entered," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without detectable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmats.
At that time it avoided itself the director of an IMSS clinic to decide, "because it led to a gas."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still go to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and where the virus has already damaged and damaged their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 Years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases occurred, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in due course and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG’s HIV unit head, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a scientific publication that was considered in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists have concluded since 2008, that AIDS is not a death penalty, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of the immunosuppression of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug dependent: up to 30 years at a 200 CD4 and 50 years at a 500 CD4 count.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that whoever receives the HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can become "problemly 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to make this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and up to May this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there have been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die?
- In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people get into a far advanced state because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a companion infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is required, so all people with this need must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Council of State de Preventción del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who carried out his test at a private laboratory, for the sole reason that he had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his youth, and even the Kaposi sarkom (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather be placed three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, work a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I look at my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agrees to share his intimate details with MILLENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his witness those who are afraid of the world's AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the charger
Between health programs and the simple citizen there are large gaps, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important is prevention.
To certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were given individually, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good already, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need them?" is a widespread question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmacies employees and health systems that young people do not want to put up with, the correspondent assured.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution should be re-oriented; condoms should not only be located behind the shop, but in publishing devices in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
The promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether to be distributed conservatively under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key Data by Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen in 4 new and accumulated AIDS cases, and in 13 HIV cases.
92% of cases of seizures occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for any recorded case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been reached through a trade contest in Mexico, a serious precedent for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country will have created the payment problem.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws in the country of the stars and strippers in opposition to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Tribunal in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads to the loss of property by Mexican companies outside the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass producer in Mexico’s door and door to call the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States competition law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first says that it is the main proceedings for the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures in case of inability to pay by companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the unification of international trade law, and the American Law Institute was used as a tool.
Secondly, the judgment determines that, without the votes of the companies, after recognising the obligations in the competitive mass that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed among companies of the group by the Federal de Concurs Mercantiles Institute.
It is also true that, following the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro's debt for his difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a blow.
For this reason, the González Sada's family objected to the same court of appeal so that the vote would take place in the plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If not, the Cerciorare dispute is brought before the Court of Justice of the United States, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher body.
The main point is that the Court had a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicius curiae (Friend of the Court) describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act and indicating that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It will also be pointed out that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border indemnity which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carabols: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Traffic trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud, did not come forward for several months, the Association Syndical de Pilotos Aviadores (the Association of Pilots) finally made progress.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is being proposed to prevent justice.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of Mexico about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove 198 million pesos from the bank's trust account F/589.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administratora Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga is the main shareholder of the Hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a wide front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak from a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, complemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) has managed to unite the Governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has failed to explain the conditions and circumstances under which Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were carried out, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered it to be a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company brings homex stock certificates of over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise a payment of interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Based on the company NYCE, e-quality and core, leading companies of information technology, a group of companies was established under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world's basketball bomber, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has been around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, either as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, the Plenipotentiary and Head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I spent a lot of my life in basketball, even though I was president of the BSN, chief businessman of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled at a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he and his faithful wife, Isabel, have been living for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a partner or manager of the club.
"It was my best years that I've enjoyed most because since 1967 I've been a part of eight Vaqueros championships as a manager, partner or coach.
There were many successful years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I agreed with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" has taken over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I also know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you like him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best broadcasters.
I still know how he said that if Mincy could have made it possible for Bayamon to win, Gause would have made another one.
The victory of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already at the top of the band in 1988.
At this time he proposed to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the U.S. for the first time at the pro-lympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we placed the fourth place, which would have been a bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian judge who had let us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
With that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiyote" Morales, who were unable to be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personality, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was the one of the pre-lympic tournaments in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacement for the closed players due to the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prediction.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking his career into account in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work for the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the relationship?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s to 17 teams in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travels and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officers and divorce courts.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and quit and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas) and was world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, domestic and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the hagier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role, which he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Ertebskfest.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas's hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life in full trains," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he added that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years prior to "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as the nicest type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC TV Hanstalt.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "dance" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at home with him.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were only released for a short time, such as The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming repugnant J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS TV chain over the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot J.R.", the expectation of an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were placed in competitions.
So the series reached a visual record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the Dallas in the second most-visible entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s brother-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had forced her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others had reason to want to see her dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a supportive businessman and an unfaithful husband who then tried to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honored citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as a "absolute personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgivable and unforgivable for millions of lovers in the world and remains for us who had the happiness to know him and to love him to receive in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
From Warner or from TNT there was no immediate explanation as to how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actor and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theatre stage in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many famous people have their place of residence.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Talt (and Absolutely True) Talks about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm someone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press in his time.
After liver transplantation, he joined the liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help worry patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations appear and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them something comforting, such as, "Don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it'll be good for you."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of courses that study the "End of the World"
Each week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keime and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an incontrovertible angle: the end of the "long return count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, named some as "Deudarmagedon", and a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what is happening in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer this semester, which should actually be the last one in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In the temple, Professor Barry Vucker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed the films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were able to compare themselves with real life.
"I've tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," she said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restaurant and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We do not take 2012 so that we always keep the option to keep the course fresh, in case the world doesn't go down," said the resttal.
Despite the "representative undergraduate" students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be carried out on the evening of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance of "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restal.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," said the restal over his course for students with high average, who met 35 students.
A week before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if seats were still available.
The students assure them that the course is among the stakeholders.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is, in fact, only a question of comfort or its shortcomings.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Hospital Care explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have not heard anything from a teaching where this is taught," he said.
I'll enjoy it.
But none of the students in question - and less a professor - explained that they believed in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in some ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never said before the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said the resttal.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that has led back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the end of the world.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote as an exception to a higher instance.
We have an appointment from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that over the years many days were spoken from the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people immediately think about a new date" or that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period, where the end of the world is coming.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several people said they wanted to go to parties over "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'm calling some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
