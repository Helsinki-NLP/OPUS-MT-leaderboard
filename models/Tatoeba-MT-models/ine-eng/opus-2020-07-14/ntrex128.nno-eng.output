Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently offended by a proposal to change the names of members of the Assembly or AM (member of the Assembly) to a member of the Wallisian Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The response was due to plans to change the name of the national assembly to the Wallisian Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is worried about your "MWP Rims on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, 'twp' means dull and 'pwp' bosj.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group 'not satisfied' and proposed options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but let MWP not be far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the walysical letter w is not expressed differently from the English Yorkshire dialect's statement of the letter u.
The National Assembly of its delegation, which now writes proposals for the introduction of the name change, said: ‘The final decision on which members of the national assembly will, of course, be to the members themselves.’
A Walysian official decided from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that showed great support for calling the Wallisian Parliament.
In the case of the title of members of the national assembly, the delegation preferred the Walysian member or WMP, while the MWP option was most supported under the public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly have a number of other proposals, but the struggle to become some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their name when they debate the bill.
Make-up noises in public destruction to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the electorate shall decide whether to change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia’.
The referendum was designed to resolve a conflict that has taken place for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the people's opinion on the change of names, said that he was coming to see the result deviated.
Supporters of public development, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change right and wrong is the price to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin stand still while the churches in Harlem, New York, struggles
"The old I've spoken to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
‘Today, none of the parts are present.’
He said he understood why the only thing disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways now to this day," he said.
‘Bars are no longer the substances in the neighborhood that people visit in general.’
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling property does not come to last as long as the leaders think, “and before or since they are back where they started.”
He made it possible for churches to be replaced by shares filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic cities of the neighborhood.
“Most of those who buy shareholdings in these buildings are white,” he said. “And this is the day when all churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the shareholdings will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black village - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black shoe that had been announced in the vicinity, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock lion by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the 125th street stores, a chief in Harlem where the owners were opposed to instituting or promoting black.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s followers planned to build it again, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson's senior and successor in St. Martin, was proud and called the clock game "the times of the poor."
The expert who played the game in July called it something else: «A cultural tax» and «a historical instrument which cannot be replaced».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first time in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merryweather said that Saint Martin did not find a substitute for him.
What has happened in Sant Martin in the last few months has become a complicated story of architects and construction workers, some of which have been added by the leaders of the playwrights in the church, and others of the episcopal bishop.
The church, which rents the sock and consists of the leaders of the playwrights, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop ‘city asks the church to pay,’ even though the church was not involved in the bishop’s addition to architects and construction workers.
Some members of the sock have complained about the lack of openness from the Bishop.
13-year-old shark damage under Hummardick in California
Officials report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he dived after lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
I picked her up right before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy called for help.
Hammel said that first he threatened only the boy was curious to have caught a hummer, before he realized that the boy cried out "Something beat me!
There's nothing wrong with me."
"His whole neck was torn off," said Hammel, he observed when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water: there is a pool in the water."
The good was obtained from air ambulances and taken to the Council hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
That's definitely what kind of thing it was that attacked the guy.
The bathroom captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to water from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species in the area, but most are not likely to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's store chain bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's must compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer wholesale services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion, and continues to grow as the fashion and interior hall goes down, Sainsbury's beauty products will be tested in 11 shops next year, and more shops will be successful.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products for 3000 products and offer brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They must give the L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The store must also re-launch its own shop shop Boutique and make most of the products vegan, something that should attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the hall of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Networking and a shift towards buying small quantities of food every day from local retail stores means that large stores need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, manager of Sainsbury's, has commented that stores will look more and more like a warehouse, while stores are trying to fight against low-price stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has joined the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, as they purchased both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food room and thus protected the purchase.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew beauty and apothecities was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties didn't know how to share the benefits of the pharmacy in the stores.
The new strategy is that Sainsbury's rare pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacy and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty halls will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special competence to offer beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed so that they fit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive destination of beauty that expands the old way to act."
Peter Jones 'breathing' after Holly Willohby moved away from the agreed world £11 million
The star from the Dragons TV program, Peter Jones, is "breathing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out an agreement with the life mark of his world £11 million to focus on the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and the accessories of their True.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of this Morning program, 37, was introduced to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of the new cooperation they have on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source reports that Jones was "breathing" when the Golden Holly attended a difficult meeting on Tuesday in Jones' headquarters business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- mean that he no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand True.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated worth of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known that she should not work with True, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to rest in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised all involved.
No one threatened their own ears on Tuesday, True was so near the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.»
Experts believe that deciding on this Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of heavy investment in products, from putts to stairwells to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as the governing body in March.
Para holiday together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, who will host his ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We don't comment on his business."
Baptise calls "and then we love"
He paid for the criticism he came to get from the media to come up with a comment some could experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Say Trump with his voice of duty as a "newer".
"I have not given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June-June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "response" from the United States regarding the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a nice relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help to release hostages and return the lives of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it came to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointing to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia ruin the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, there was no one who declared the state of the national crisis, which is necessary for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they do not want international help, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd Children combine a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add foreign passports to the field.
Sutopo, the spokesperson for the National Crisis Bureau in Indonesia, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to see about international organisations for the right to aid.
Although Indonesia is often subject to earthquakes, the country is not particularly vulnerable to natural disasters.
In the Aceh area, they have built space for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, something most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian eyes is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in a cage in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
However, lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and the next year there is another choice.
President Joko will also be pressed when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have responded well to his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslims are fighting in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Parliament status of Cromwell becomes the last victim of «rewrite of history»
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 1600s civil war.
But the Cromwell Association describes Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "wearing" and "a attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Federation, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconic class during the English Civil War was strictly ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's fault would have been sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather, Thomas, centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the story of a figure that many still seem to be worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one, there is still a discussion theme in the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we knew represented one side of that division.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Murdering and killing Chinese bonds
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut pulse years and covered with blood, close to a piglink on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30th, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his aunt from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found the fatter his death, and discovered that the door to one of the grizzards was open.
He said that there was a large ring of blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilos of heavy gray had killed the bottom, according to the report.
"The bones of my stepfather were bloody and corrupt," said the stepfather, named Wu, to Guiyang Eventing News.
The surveillance room shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him, did not listen to Yuan or his fat.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the east.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such measures have been taken by pigs before.
In 2016, a pig went to arrest a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - pound [295 - kg] pig caught a Walysian bond between itself and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a pawn in Oregon became the food of its pigs in 2012, a pawn from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood can last.
"Dei just wants to play.
They like to bite a little bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
The rest of the hurricane, Rosa, brings rain to southwestern USA
As foretold in the weather report, the hurricane Rosa is weakened over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will be preparing her peaches for North Mexico and South-West America in the next days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was an hurricane of category 1 until 05:00 in the outlying weather zone in the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa has to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure on the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north-west-USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisturizer will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the south-west in the next days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous rivers and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rain of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of South-West America, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of South-West America, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous floods may arise due to widespread terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against hikes in the desert of foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn bubbles into flaming rivers and lightning and tornadoes will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the South-California coast.
The total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, something that can create small rivers and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainforest for the season in the region.
Spreading tropical rain forests will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain rises late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strikes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There are almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, his summer heat will try to build up and spread out again.
Many of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a hot start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southernmost of the major deletions to parts of the North-East USA.
New York City can now reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the East-US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million are looking at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony to Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who blamed him for sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political debate on the matter, with interruptions in the usual television programmes of various broadcasters, continued to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the debts during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when she was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sentimental defamation, that he's 100 percent sure that's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, followed by Nielsen.
The company came to this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number could not be retrieved from other channels that showed a detachment, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting sailors looking at from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of sailors looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News's hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also with most sailors during the day with 5.69 million sailors, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million sailors.
CBS had 3.1 million sailors, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on the Kavanaugh side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on the way to a hearing with a courtroom on Friday.
He stood and watched in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants put on him on CNN's life.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you trust him to tell the truth about our land?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had spoken, and before he entered the elevator he said he wanted to have more sailing under the committee's ear.
The broadcasting agency showed the ring on TV when the judgment panel was to be heard for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh for full late and further chatting.
But Flake said that he could only do so if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, something the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overcome after talking to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not fight for Kavanaugh without a search.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "equipment policy" when applied to Brexit
The UK Minister of State Theresa May owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to "play politics" with the future of the UK without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with May at the front of Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is taking place on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU should collect their fees is ‘very absurd’.
Wade Sims Shootinga in the United States: Police arrests the suspected Dyteon Simpson for Sims Shootinga
The police arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate murder, says the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses under the target.
The police found the glasses on the east and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, follow a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.

Simpson's bail was set to $350 000, local advisor The Advocate reports.
The Coroner in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police support the state police in Louisiana's special forces, the state police's crime lab, the South University police and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “vigilant in the achievement of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meters high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 flips per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "feel free" after Wade was killed.
"Then there's something we're always afraid of," said Wade.
The volcano is asking about Mexico City.
Oske from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The national crisis prevention centre requests Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity has increased in the crater and the centre recorded 183 gas and ozone emissions over 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and shrieks.
The pictures on social media show thin layers of oak on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which was 72 kilometres south of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Politicians compete with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the self-defense
Six demonstrators were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of self-defence with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-defence one year after the crackdown on any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powders that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Consistency broke out also later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
In several hours the separatists called "Don't forget, don't forgive" but protests against their own call, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after the protests.
The vote is still under pressure in the region and many will still have one year after the 1st October uprising, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the electors smoked for themselves, but there was also low electoral participation among those who were against self-extinguishing and boikott smoking.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the riot and the electoral collapse occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the state police.
The demonstration, however, went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with a woman said that he no longer has hope for himself in Catalonia.
"We experienced one of our moments last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to sleep for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although the waters of the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too close to holding power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or under arrest while awaiting legal cases for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of self-determination.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was home to politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who had been part of the ongoing case-law since last year, declared that he was to be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To remain a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the fall in democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

A bracelet may have been used to shoot the car.
Menga-Skot gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Merge your first target for Livingston hedges says
The heated Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard with his second saying after 18 campaigns as coaches for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to explain the difference while Gary Holt's side matched the hibernian in others.
Gerard's side has no passersby in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and shall play against Hearts, as they lay eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
Livingstone has six wins in row, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against the remote
Hold his team would have had to rent long before they scored, and created more problems for Rangers with the direct play says.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had a low effort towards goals, something that made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halket his head over the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the remote team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers went to a fresh park and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and score from the middle of the criminal field.
Before that, Ranger's ball dominated, but he saw that the home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was far away after the ball was returned from Livingstone.
The guards were sent back and forth in the Livingston penal field, while two penalties--after Halket's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands--were blown away.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
BBC Scotland son of Alastair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal outcome for Livingstone.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve up.
The play and player style of theirs has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks to it go to Holt for the way he looked at the page he became coaches.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organised a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the entire fight.
Rangers were not motivated on the contrary.
Yet as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up half of the house once, something that should get Rangers to realize they didn't get up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The statesmen in Turkey and Germany sang under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is expected to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries are not alone when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a population of more than 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of 'security reasons', but many of Erdogan's supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan -- many of the Kurdish -- also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state said he wanted to welcome him to the country.
The dubious Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who looked at Erdogan as a whole, and others, who looked at him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclists suffered after car collision
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision near her crossed by Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in southeastern London, at 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance staff arrived quickly, but the man died on the east.
The collision took her only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver left at Childers Street, about six miles from today's accident.
The London police reported that they were in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards injured in rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
The following storm broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces are obtained to calm down the riot, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries in the face.
One jailer said: "Special interest guards must calm down the ongoing riot in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate the election in our prisons, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail any longer."
It has more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for damages after a prisoner went into custody.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiards on the guards.
The Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the sake of drought)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves south-west over the desert and creates fear of flame.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flum on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and South-East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweets that only "Third tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres outside the Arizona border.’
The latest models from the national orchestra report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It may be between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the South West, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the flood risk, the Rosa can be a blessing in the drought.
Although flame is a serious concern, it is likely that this calculated profit area in the South-West US is exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, the extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the next highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, the Orkan Rosa comes to move over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With a wind of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets the colder water in the Pacific and is worried about it.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storms, Monday afternoon or evening.
There's going to be a lot of calculation in parts of Mexico, something that can increase the risk of flame.
«The rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull up through Arizona and enter south-Utah Tuesday evening.
“The biggest threat to Rosa or the rest of it is much rain in Baja California, North West Sonora, and the American South West,” said the National Orcan Centre.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening rivers in the desert and landscapes in the mountain area.
Measures in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrests for killing trials
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old was found the knife in Somerset, England.
The teenage gust was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.

The police have invited people who can have mobile recordings of what happened to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" during which "sick and sad" Democrats were against him
"A voice for the Kavanaugh judges is a voice against the vicious and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered during which “bad and sad” Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony in front of the congress on Thursday, and refused emotionally for the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her for more than ten years ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that the "American people saw how brilliant and brave" was that day.
"A Russian to judge Kavanaugh is a Russian to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with no faulty service in the public," he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the U.S. elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't, but I really do," he said.
‘That is why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democracies are out after ‘standing up and blocking’.
The first important debate in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, a Republican representative of CNN said.
Dogs killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, speak of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a strong earthquake and a tsunami framed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival at the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which was six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, and took many people while the evils all they came over.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the warning of tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't move on one occasion and thus became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he carried cars, trunks, houses; he framed everything on land," said Nugroho, and let the tsunami travel over the open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb up into three to avoid the tsunami and survive that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After that, we continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Agency for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) said that the energy from the Earth’s Earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the Agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the injured have been found during the rest of the collapse buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of accidents and the size of the injuries could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is more epicentric to the scar.
"We have heard nothing from Dongala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
‘More than 300,000 people live there,’ the Red Cross said, adding and volunteering to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse," said the Red Cross.
On Saturday, the crisis agency was criticised for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, even if the authorities said waves had arrived before the warning period.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man in the upper floor of a building who cries desperately to man down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast and took with it buildings and cars.
Computers could not verify the video at first.
The shield and tsunami cause a power breach and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has launched the process of sending cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened to receive emergency assistance, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of arrivals in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They have been added to the World Vision from Dongala to the city of Palu, and they have set up counted in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city they passed the totally damaged areas, said Dosebah.
"They told me they saw many damaged houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief organisations are starting their work to help those affected by tsunamis, some have complained that foreign emergency relief workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations cannot be added to the work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is a crisis at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up international emergency assistance, but they have not updated the status yet.’
It is still evening in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still lacking hope still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the clock.
On Sunday a woman was rescued from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had been incarcerated by the dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, thirty-two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my emotional burden to prepare," he said.
Gendon said he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think this means that the messages did not appear," he said.
Thieves set $26,750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, the thief stole $26,750 from a worker in Brink's company in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, followed a press release from the Newport police.
The employee had just emptied a minibank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to deliver.
The witness observed several suspects as they escaped from the east, followed the press message, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the raid.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He declared the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: “The creation was previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he was to act on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show after cancelling because of "emotional causes," the software host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word “ye” is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with the West, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without strings and large letters.
Mexico's future president promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the blood treatment of students.
Lopez Obador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to become part of criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the USA should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacked a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
An increase in funding can double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month via the publication Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is managing director (CEO) of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized earlier technological competitions organised by the US, such as ‘Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge’ and asked how long the next competition would be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen discernment on artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students will have automatic permission before artificial intelligence,” he said.
The Council of State in China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Association of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organisations, their way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (art intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on proposals for national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Make-up noises in public destruction to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people in a riot on Sunday were to change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a ten-year-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement in their territory and has used veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not interfere with the people's desertification, and a boycott has doubted how much the population's desertification is going to reach at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question of the People's Resolution is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change of names is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved itself after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to discuss the future of this country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the dispute is not binding by law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the dispute to make it decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two thirds of the floor.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 per cent had been heard, as opposed to 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters had been heard.
"I am fighting for my children, we are listening to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a leader in the capital, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, in Strumika, in the People's Democratic Republic of Macedonia, to change their name and open up to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of public opinion in front of the Skopje Parliament, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they won't have us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
State Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent of unemployment.
"I believe that the majority are coming to a halt for the change, of your 80 per cent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after having spoken.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A survey of Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are coming to take part in public education – something that is under the poverty line.
Another measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to relax on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent came up to say yes.
In order for the population to be closed, at least 50 per cent must be dissolved, plus one.
If the referendum is not closed, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling withdrew the Brighton defense that led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously light when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine food took a turn on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defence players and reached the open path.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender, before he ran past several others on the edge of Brighton's field of punishment.
He came over a fit on the left and found Sterling.
The English dish used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit the Brighton-keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the target.
«Aguero still slid with his feet,» said the City coach Pep Guardiola to report.
«We talked about that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League struggle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He threw the ball in the pretty way along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane was on the ball while he was leavin' Sterling against the target.
The sky blue bites the ball into a target right before it slips out of the path.
City will play against Hoppenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play games with Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from Playoff Continuation, there was no reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competition instincts, and hopes to take the “mountain” on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to the “playoff” for Rockies, which leads with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who does not want to play with such conditions?"
It is still uncertain who is to start in Nationals on Sunday, but it may be that Scherzer is to 'pitche'.
Scherzer, who then starts for 34th time, throws a "bullpen session" on Thursday and has to "pitch" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collects selectors in West Virginia
In short, the President referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the U.S. elections.
"All we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not putting up, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're exaggerated that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see where they are, where they are, where they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
“And you can see it based on the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “sin and evil and pure and dishonest.”
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to build.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who played the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Work is no longer tolerated.
They're intolerant to those who say what's mine.
When the Momentum activists in my local party came up to sensitize me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labor MPs that's been told that I'm not welcome -- just to see what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because he protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for being incoherent with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to how important it was to drive responsible economies, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically was probably in disagreement with previous leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said ‘we want to meet to be inclusive and productive.’
In the last eight years, like the Labour MP, we've had a Friday meeting just like that.
Various today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "sniffer" policy has been forgotten for the longest time, if it had been followed in the whole.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every thought is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically with sudden expectations that I should redefine myself and agree on matters I would never agree - if it were a matter of national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak in public, I have nothing to say about what I am saying, I always get the social media and people who want me to leave while they criticise the central policy and say that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sex discrimination and racist Shikkin straight to themselves every day, who are still professional and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period is how normal it has been to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone; for each mistrust proposal and for each change in the party rules, the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I have received many advice from the last two years from people who have said I must take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "just like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I entered Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was thinking about Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall together, so I wanted to have better public services for those who needed the most - whether it was as a municipal adviser or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can doubt what I stand for and who of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who are in favour of the Friday proposal, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will damage private, local offices and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy to ask questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two of his 'tries' might change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr continued to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership campaign today.
They're now at the top of the ball as the only invincible layer of all ten.
It was their sovereigns' defence and ability to take chances that gave their homeman and coach Peter Murchie a good reason to be happy.
"We have been tested in the last campaigns, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Hey, they were smarter than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a 'tray' in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a 'conversion' that put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a 'unconverted try'.
Climo got a fine right before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s “try,” which became “converted” by Baggot, reduced the grinding coin by five points.
There was a long break when Ruarid Knott was seriously damaged and placed on the bar, and from the re-start, Ayr went forward through a 'tray' from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo 'converted'.
The functioning captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got yellow cards, and again Melrose tried an 'unconverted Bruce Colvine try,' at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the criminal configuration, score MacPherson a «try».
Climo 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong his box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from home his fifth «try».
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with the partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last, and it seems like Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of the Agriturismo Limited.
The shooter will not comment on the case, but a source of Scottish Sun's report suggests that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the right will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol Marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Sea bass from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon Sea was discovered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the obligation to return to it.»
In a landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 1800s, and they extend after sailing back to the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice that will come on 1 October, after five years of space.
"Bolivia has a drive, a calm and united spirit, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to see the resignation of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after ten years of negotiations - gives Bolivia a self-evident exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia -- who was trying to be elected again next year -- has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is coming to let Bolivia access to the sea--and that a little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The decision of the Court of Justice only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from promoting Bolivia's thing they've done the opposite.
«The problems of access to the sea have been overcome by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
Morales, with his belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issues after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's verdict was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given the "extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "throw at 139 years of inequality and gain both," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem position to win rumors.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't eliminate nuclear weapons if they don't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation can't be the first to cancel, if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promises they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start with his fixed nuclear-related plomase, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subjugate itself if the United States continues to face sanctions and object to any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to join in any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang cancels first.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headlights are the last motto on the way to a handlegged near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of large and special main spots in their SS19 collection.
The highest practical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The largest blow was an overwhelming, beige Valentino hat with a winglike, at the brake covering the models its head.
There was also another over-dimensional accessories under the motto, including a jewelry watermelon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple--but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a collection of bizarre masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were south together and similar to Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One of the creations is like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melting ice in the kitchen.
If you like this enormous dramatic word, you can only enjoy it.
Mote experts report that the huge hats are coming for the salt in a handcuff near you.
The over-dimensional hats come right after "La Bomba", the 60 cm wide beam head that has been seen on knowledge from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the most unpracticed hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk--a beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore her.
Beachesque, with color of burn orange and frenzy top with a white skin handle, was the most promising part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Kendis-stylelist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach towels in the fashion shops next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessories."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private spheres in Scotland are known to be at high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other community action.
With more than 30 000 lifts across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Self-School Council (SCIS), work by offering the best services to the lifts and their parents.
Self-educated schools aim to prepare their lifts for continuing and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a tailor-made pendulum, we see modern languages are popular optional in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, then the word of his heart goes to him."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only borrow English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
By looking at the results of the exams this year, we can see that the language is at the top of the league tables with the highest steel characters for self-employed students.
A total of 68 percent of the lifts that took foreign language received A.
The data collected from the SCIS' 74 member schools show that 72 per cent of the lifts received A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who took German, 69 per cent of those who took French, and 63 per cent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that self-employed schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital qualities, such as children and young people who are absolutely going to need in the future.
Languages as optional are seen as equivalent to STEM (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in pensumas to self-employed schools and other places.
A study carried out by the UK choice of additions and properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers have failed to fill their jobs due to the lack of language skills among applicants.
Therefore, it is more and more important with language in school to prepare young people for work.
With more job opportunities for language teachers, these qualities are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a youth has, if they have learned a different language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person the benefit of a competitive world.
Following a YouTube survey of more than 4000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to find more languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each scale is different when it comes to what language they teach.
Many schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in self-employed schools and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed students are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will provide children and give them the characteristics they need to close, no matter what the future may bring.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘International communication properties’.
Self-employed students will continue to offer this option, offering diversity and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish self-employed school council.
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is soon for fans who are looking to see LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the presong campaign on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of playing has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 49," announced Walton on Laker's official website.
The Laker's reporter, Mike Trudell, argues that James most likely will play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the pre-season.
"I don't need a preview game at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stop next week, including stop at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote waiting to choose to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress when votes are taken in November.
How long is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to record this week's hearings of the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about the charges of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate waiting for up to one week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cavenge of collections is to help Republicans meet November's elections and have some moments (driving).
Thus President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are aimed at "promoting volunteers and supporters who the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", says Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," one speaker of the Trump campaign said that he refused to be informed to Reuters.
Designed for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection can bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw cover from Pittsburgh Media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican latent Patrick Morrisey, who is being asked in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a raise in his mind measurements," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup trowel.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is an entirely invented sports match, but one that players really believe, and never more than competitions like these.
So where would they say the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lease, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he escaped for the day.
Europe has, of course, taken four points with 12 more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Speeth has our mortals from tea to green and rent after example.
The Guttural screams of the celebration were higher when his round continued, seeking an important well to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won those 15 fights, was met with a similar scream, the kind that told you that he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
"You've actually just got buried deep and worried about your own struggle," Spieh said.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to create a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's flagship, but sweet couples are four from four and can't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who wouldn't shoot a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but the young men also boweys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a path with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
It's going on, and the way their energy looks to move both to and from this noisy, busy audience, says they're the players to be hit on Sunday, and it wouldn't be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time on different halls.
Talking about European honors is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's 4th ball team, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the first nine, digging the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they never came close by climbing out.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between opponents, they give advice, and they don't give advice, and the way a strategy can change an eyelid.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant rent in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially the State side, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome-combats with a 10-6 lease across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take its fight so far on Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophies lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American side in the morning fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance to foursomes and won two campaigns, but they could not get the undercut.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from the 12 single teams on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an eye-opening weekend, is only the second pair that wins four points from their opening in four campaigns in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they gave themselves so great to kick off an issue of Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more pursuit 5 and 4.
Woods, who slid through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliant, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, who knelt for the morning's fourballs, returned to the partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe has not yet received everything they wanted on a pleasant, startled day south-west of Paris.
Three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas win the U.S. reference with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point base and went into single, even if the holder only needs Fury's page to draw to maintain the trophies.
After having been the next best for two days, however, it seems as if a Sunday attack would be beyond them.
North Korea says it's not going to be one-sided.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase, the mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly to the World Power that North Korea had made "significant measures" to improve its relationship last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't get anything back from the United States, however," he said.
"Without trust in the United States it will not be trusted in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has filed several complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase” approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his question showed significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a common question written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit somewhere between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed talks to facilitate the imposition of international sanctions in North Korea.
«USA insists on 'restructuring nuclear power first' and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and they even objected to 'the declaration of ending peace', said Ri.
"Trusting that sanctions can crush us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions go forward, our mistrust only grows."
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister held three meetings in place between Kim and South Korea, his leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months, and added: ‘Show the party in this call for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons was South Korea, not the United States, would not have stopped the decommissioning of the Korean peninsula as it has now done’.
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri’s was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the US mainland, after President Trump of the sentence called Kim a rocketman on his suicide mission.
Trump, who in the past threatened to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea, ausra rose over Kim for his opposition to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to be in place to North Korea disband its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be firmly maintained and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified termination of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to poison the funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that it had been made progress, but a few hours later he condemned North Korea to come with "walking-like demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city and also a nuclear complex if the United States did ‘appropriate measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the "consistent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and stepped against normalization of Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that goes out to study in the whole night of caffeine, which means that a user of caffeine will stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that students at the top university are often pointless when it comes to being the most basic - how to keep yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the affected lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the day a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, in the grown age?'
Ho said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains to the students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had severed their sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of the elevator at once.
But we think they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler.
The credibility culture of day-to-day existence still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even by avoiding going up to weight, since the lack of sleep sees the brain in soft mode and makes them constantly melt.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after having our student brought him to Harvard last year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that the elevators should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can transform the inner clock completely, leading to problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerrard's men down
Rangers went on a new landing on the road when Dolly mixed his deposit send Steven Gerrard's side to a 1-0 loss on Livingstone.
Ibrox-side was looking after taking his first victory on the faraway side of the 4-1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but the team to Gary Holt caused only Gerrard to defeat his second 18-gauge camp, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's league of Premier League, Hearts.
Melting locks up to seven minutes before half an hour, and a ranger configuration with lack of inspiration never seemed to make a difference.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third and lies only behind the Hibernian on the target.
And there may be a further problem in the Rangers stock after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown away from the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that celebrates Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have our curiosity about the way that the wildly attracted him took the qualifiers of his opponents at every turn.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingstone did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored only two minutes when Menga sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-level player failed in his campaign.
A far fresco from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return deposit.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than a threat to their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's knowledge was certain that he would have punished the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but the judge Steven Thomson hesitated to the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but earlier Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was almost worried about Lassana Coulibally's head and a thin shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the player's glasses, no one can deny that they won it only because of the "shot".
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which was fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard paused as if he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate effect when the player made a lock for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to list the guest team to play exactly what the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halket sending out long shots on the Long Shot.
Holt's team could have increased the rent said at the end, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long deposit from the corner mark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new requirement for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but still ignored Thomson.
Almanac: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now one side of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we REKNAR ... the day he became physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger numerator.
As a scientific carrier all over then, Geiger was also a carrier in pop culture, as in the movie Bells of Coronado from 1950, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger numerator, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you turn these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms coming from the radioactivity in minerals.»
Evans: "Yes, let's do it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the inventions that ask for his name live on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to “see” red cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" red cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them into the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many forms of cancer and then reinvigorate.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells again, experienced that the ovum-force disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that is common in many forms of cancer, called HER2, and then reinstate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 «drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to getting immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ the way they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West initiated a Pro-Trump-diatribe, introduced an MAGA-lue, after he hosted a TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was tapped into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a tireless performance where he raised his president, Donald Trump, and said he would put in the 2020 election.
After having taken his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had on himself a Make America Great-Caps, he gave the Democrats a triad and repeated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, 'Could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with the comicist Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's legal election on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the tape was uploaded to the West to the social media of comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to web the West with the article.
West also complained to the public that he had a difficult backstage because of his main blow.
"You called me behind the scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
De mobba me!
And then they say I'm in a low position," he said, following Washington Examiner.
West goes on: "Do you want to see the drop-down place?" says he would "take on the superman, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.»
His comments led him to eviction at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed to be pitifully concerned, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: “The whole studio was dead.”
West was picked up as a son's replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a twitter: «For one of the most brave spirits: TAK FOR YOU TO BE OPENED TO THE PUBLE».
But the talk show-over Karen Hunter tweeted that "the West was probably just like him and it's totally amazing."
“But I did NOT choose to hire anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) who I think is familiar with and ask for ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That is what we are, too.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade, Snoop Dogg has got the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last musical Prince, changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the sword-ringing role as Jon Snow in HBO's elective Middle Ages fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead to young boys feeling they must be able to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought something had gone wrong and asked how one should deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones-companioner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knew "a bit strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit thinks that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human characteristics.
He goes on to say, "What is born and what is taught?"
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
'Cause it's clear that something's gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones runs or follow-up when the series ends in summer and says he is "completed with battlefields and horses".
Since November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The shooter recently revealed that he was looking at the meeting with the woman said Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way I gave it to my future family and my next life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the focus of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are bordering the country, health supplements say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through six, and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add lacquer information from GOP-senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiration theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Woes condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had issued personal information about three republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedalized by "extrem-right-wing" investigations and websites.
"Leaders, liars and more preposterous lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided included, for example, addresses and telephone numbers of the American Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill under a Senate panel saying the charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the installation was linked to Waters' office and issued the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"One of my additions - which have received their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.’»
The issue of Water was quickly criticised on the Internet, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is insane,’ Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be crazy.
They don't have to be drunk.
They do not need to ask questions about the reason for the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer showed himself to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the judges Kavanaugh, who had been blamed by critics to be seemingly sinister during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's position in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The place if it's true," he tweeted.
In the reply, Waters said that her office had warned "the correct authorities and the judicial authorities of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,’ he continues, ‘and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and every one of my employees.’
Johnny English hits again - Spytonul of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look at Brexit's remarkable properties in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this recovery of Johnny England's action-commediae spof-franchie - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the new export agency in the country become a sea-virontic satire, which deals with the extent to which we are open?
In any case, the great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber blade has for the second time been renewed his permission to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic book for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the stupid, secret agent who crosses in his bizarre desire to spread a little glamorous has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the chariots, the theme during the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystical man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos behind.
There's one or two fine eyebrows in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a middle-aged armored suit while rotor blade hits his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on screen, but humor felt quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because of the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Ni itself now safely offers comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he was directed towards children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noise is not so ingenious and focused as Atkinson's replicacle is dressed in the person in Bean.
The permanent current entry into force now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-inhabited web network of spies, which detects the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the detriment of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a minister of state who is a Pompeii and warlord figure, who already has a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it is not so much in the script to work with.
Her advisors inform her that when every active spy has been guilty, she must get someone retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works at some elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine tribes here, since English offers a School of Rock-Type Academy for Spinning.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a state of emergency lettering and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a subcontractor's job, an over-enthusiast role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become awfully crazy in Henry's Secret Service is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Minister of State was dangerously in the pursuit of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, which claimed that he could solve the UK's data problem: the anxious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are beginning to travel say of a fatherly wild game: dressed as servants, they put the guys on a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and sneak on board the Volta lightboat; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to become acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and disciplined as it is, it's quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
The Labour Party denies that they are going to draw up a plan for Englishmen to work for four days, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party now evaluates a radical plan that wants the British to work four days a week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will send further savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra Friday.
Then he would add that he could enjoy a three-day weekend--but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase the benefits of employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the year shift.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the near party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party's industrial strategy.'
The Working Party would not be the first to approve such an idea when the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the whole Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and it is not assessed by the party.'
The shadow canals John McDonnell used earlier to hold a working conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw power from "unfair directors" and "professors" in rich companies.
The plans of the shadow canal also mean that the current shareholders of the basin cannot regain their full effort when a labour government could make 'debts' due to perceived abuse.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in company management and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to give 10 per cent of equity in private sector companies to add, which would have annual dividends of up to £500, about SEK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the TV program "60 Minutes" about the FBI's research into Kavanaugh's ability to change their thoughts
The FBI's investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final settlement of his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of how far the Agency was found to affect some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview that will be sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would get them to redefine themselves.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I'm mine, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the hall, I said, I have spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, determined."
However, Graham's voice appears to be in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamic commitment to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, "let Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all its names could not be verified.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive picture of stars that perform and a similar impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the great Plenary of Central Parks, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes' behaviour, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send an email to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen been back 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of hireing people with a free concert a real way to convince people to call for action, or just another case of so-called "clitivism" people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has registered more than 19 million "acts" from its support players, and has participated in and pressed on a number of different goals.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe means to date have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and contractors who are obliged to "help children reach their full potential"; pledges to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undermining in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national government and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of undermining to a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they had taken more than 5000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, they ask, "What do you fear that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the actors who will be present at the event of the year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
United States could use the fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East, that they want to share energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And follow the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has this ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open and, if necessary, the blocks to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zincke spoke to participants on the events organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as ‘vote to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while showing Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, service providers in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which, as a result of Trump, made Berlin into Moscow’s “capture”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's zealous resistance to the project is only driven by economic causes, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US holding has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, a leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to stand as president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would take a "deep look" at sitting as a presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider silence as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and it includes a woman at the top," said The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will assess the position of the President’.
Warren took part in President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "leads this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has our crack in his criticism of Trump and his supreme-right Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the reconciliations."
However, a poll issued on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own electors did not believe it should be held as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probably" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not remain a candidate, follow the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he wanted to decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin his PTSD (post-traumatic stress suffering) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being in custody in September.
He was arrested and sentenced to a civil war in the world on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes me relate to other families who are beaten by PTSD and some of the wounds with which our solar data returns," said he to the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that his son and other war veterans “will come back to change a little, they will come back to the shepherds, they will come back and wonder if the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have done for the country has been done.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was held responsible for the physical election of the world against a woman, to have a report on the election of the world and the storage of a weapon while he was Russian, followed by Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Challenge of support for new asylum policies
The eight states and districts in Colombia face a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing from re-elected or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-on-right brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions corresponds to the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said her partner "and the elected regent sons" abused her, but US officials denied her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of applicants for American asylum, which nations face comprehensive problems with repeats and choices in the world.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision on immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled the world to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of government, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such an obstacle to conflict with this principle,’ said a friend-of-law card.
Advocates further state in the summary that the policy refusing to grant immigrants access is damaging to the US economy and that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provides necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Session ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims of refugee abuse and re-elected in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who have left their home because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,’ the Sessions of 11 June announced the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while dying double in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more and more serious.
‘It was very excited,’ said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who touched her sick baby son at an evacuation centre in the damaged town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find."
Residents have been observed on their way back to their damaged homes, in what they are looking for through damaged properties and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital that was damaged by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, was overcrowded.
Some of the damage, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, wailed outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to still strong post-distribution.
tears filled his eyes as he told him that he knew the mighty earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughters in the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I suppose, ” Harris told the Associated Press, and he left his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China to ‘mobbing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper launched a 4-page advertisement in an American newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the US and China, the US ambassador owed China Beijing to use the US press to spread propaganda.
USA President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to blend in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China refuses.
Trump's guilt that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections, marked what American servicemen told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government officials to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are in time locked up in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on their imports.
China's recovery rates early in the trade war were designed to meet exporting producers in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's republican party, have said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
«China», Branstad wrote in a part of the Sunday's Des Moines register, «doubles the mobbing by running advertisements in our own free press.»
‘In its propaganda, the Chinese government is benefiting from the American loving tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by introducing a paid ad in the Des Moines register,’ Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the avisciosco on the bottom of the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problem economic path, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers rejected the offer of publishing” his article, even though he did not say what about a newspaper.
Republicans do not allow female voters to lead the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns analysts.
Since many top Republicans are standing-town and defend the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in meeting more charges for sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a return, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they already wanted to go ahead with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is doubting that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eyebrows pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to entertain his own voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protestants "November come!" while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination tras in the witness burden of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be out of the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our height, it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before the Ford's public witness, which detailed the allegations of sexual abuse directed against the distinguished Supreme Court, suggested analysts that a return be followed if the Republicans press forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing root for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, followed NBC News.
‘It is not just about voting to the committee or final reconciliation, or if Kavanaugh is on the bench, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,’ said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group involved in the election of Democrats, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who they're going to threaten in the cool water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more side tracks with the last of them.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably threatened Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably threatened Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they threatened that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his witness burden, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Be witness to the board of directors of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaugh totally violated her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking sex organs showed her while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in 1980.
The creator of the World Wide Web Plans to start a new Internet meeting for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology alloys, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where the data is stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It is a historical eyelid.’
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal web store is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, following the management director of John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of the glasses of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google to not introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely turned over at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994 he transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence on the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.

Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross divine Fair
The only English church goddess who won a Victoria course during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in her home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a snowman four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A monument was demolished by his two children on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be dried up exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "through a very thick forest and under heavy fire from fields and masks."
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallery", he led the line forward before he allied himself with a field weapon and pulled out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German snowflake on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Watern, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am tired of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Watern said that he knew very well about playing a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real one is fully shown by the support given by many people.”
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206men, so you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 campaigns, including six on the master card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, there were sailors in the United Kingdom again amazed when the decks changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had kept alert to the early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter describes the change to the drawing series of children as "a kind of sick ghost."
"It is public regulation that 6 hours if the content was not such, they had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator, when he was asked about the transfer.
«Peppa-grisen, «yes».
Bellator Society President Scott Coker said they should work on planning to include British sailors in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out," Coker said.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
I was reminded that when it passed, there were many texts that went back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, it won't happen the next time.
We're going to keep it to five campaigns instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we were trying to survive to the fan, and we were just going over.
It is an unfortunate situation.’»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself as "subsidized" because of sexuality
The Olympicist Tom Daley says that in the increase he felt worse than all because of his sexuality--but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24th anniversary said that he didn't understand before he went on his way to pretend that "not everyone is like me."
As he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island album presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about homofil's rights to give other "hope".
He also said being a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The solid reporter in the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months free of disease.
What could look like an exception in Laverne's first program, Daly said that he knew "less than" all the others who grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to equal boys and girls."
He said: "From this day forward, having a sense of being less than and being different, would be the real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "noco", he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its look at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he knew himself fortunately who could live open without misunderstandings and wanted to give other "hop".
The three-time world champion said it was to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said the age difference never had a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"--he went to his first OL 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and cuts.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, do everything I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I was happy when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OL in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life--to dive into a home audience at an Olympic game where there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the first song of his--Stolt of Heather Small--who had vibrated with him in the construction of the OL and gave him still ghastly skin.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Out of shape his Mikkelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup-combat, but he has to turn his form to avoid that it's an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Fury in front of the Saturday’s golf course in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, split the five times the great winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before the range of hope of correcting what he is hurting.
Never the most competent long scores. Not even at the top of your career, the 48-year-old is best to meet with long scores on the hard, French main track where balls hit unless the golfer is accurate to the beat.
And if the road itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth match Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has fought with smokey Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single struggles, get to a hot start, Mickey's struggle can be quite decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much different.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and left his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's put so much on these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I saw more for me, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, even though Fury said that his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the camp," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got around him, too, this week, which was funny to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.”
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large lease can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last few days of Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama campaign, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the target line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, won 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continued to remember that we had a large rent on Valderrama; we had a large rent on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, after he had seen Classa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have scored the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is going to be.
I have said all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are so well aware of what is on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad to see how his players have acted on a dusty golf course, let Bjørn add: "I would never take the winner in advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances are coming up, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you'll be fully testing out of your ability as a golfer.
This is a message you need to tell your players; you will get the best out of it tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, unlike the number Jim Fury will be looking after that his players will perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who get three points out of four.
Fury himself has been in both ends of the snow operations in the last few days, after having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended losing when Europe took off the Mirakelet in Medina.
"I think every single single word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way in the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start with the fast start you saw at Brookline, which you saw at Medina.
When the time comes, you see a lot of pressure on the middle of the campaign.
We set up our line-up at the same time and set up the gouts in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole road," Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship is still under way
The newest cargo of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace ageing warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least the next year due to bad systems and cutting costs, reported local media.
Initiation of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leadership of the splits of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class Fregatane, has now been appointed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avisa, which quotes a military speaker.
The ship would have ended up in the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery struck the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg classes of ships were ordered back in 2007, replacing the aged Bremen class with the Fregattans.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-flight and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest cargoes for up to two years away from the ports at home.
However, continuous delays in the fact that the road-breaking warships, which have allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be updated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss verft in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important software and hardware errors that made the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software error was especially important when the ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen ferries.
It also showed that the ship is dramaticly overweight, something that reduces the performance and limits the even fleet has to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes of Rhineland-Pfalz is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships that were used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the human being - will also become a problem.
It has been said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the opening €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problems associated with the newest fergatets are particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended on the competent ship of distribution".
The officer said that the problem was over time, because old ships were dissolved, but no compensation vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flagger Mouse
New research carried out on the property of the Scottish Highland has the aim of discovering how the flag mouse uses the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that finding will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to remedy future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipistrelles and also brown langora and Daubenton flag mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS additives and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flag mouse calls and what kind of species they do.
A map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural scientist for NTS, hopes the results will discover which area of habitat, natural homes, which is most important for the flag mouse and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as a purchase of rabbits and how it is best to maintain the same forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects resting places and loss of habitat/buplaces.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pets.
Flagger mouse is not actually blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching exchange animals.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to detect errors and obstacles in their flight routes.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major fences and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten experts who regularly carry out investigations, sleep-place inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flag-museum reserve at the Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag-museums.
Property manager David Thompson says ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a beautiful area for flag mouse," he said.
«We have old buildings, lots of vets and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for flags before performing maintenance within properties, as it is possible that endless destruction of a single bubble can kill up to 400 female flags and young people, and perhaps eradicate an entire local population.
Flagger mouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flags and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects government debts in the lawyer's case in German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has noted the government's charges against him as "false news", and says that people "want to exalt themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus have been responsible for electing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's being claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers, only hours after the debts, that the debts are «false news».
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
«They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good, "let the player laugh and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel's claims, which they have called 'an unlawful report on suspicions within the area of privacy', according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount that represents how serious the rule is, something that is probably one of the most serious crimes of personal justice in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have found a city in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room to the player, who claimed that he would have elected her anal, follow the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was ‘99 percent’ a ‘good guy’ and failed with ‘one percent’.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but was later consulted on an account because she felt “warred of reprisal” and was concerned about “to become publicly audacious.”
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to replace the bust when she's still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to become with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'ville for always undo' to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will regret it forever’ if it has lost its status as a world leader before the production of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'about' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of the delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that, at the end of March, some UK is leaving the EU, we see production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford in one month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with the risks of supply chains in the case of a non-Brexit contract.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the threshold that the industry is experiencing may lead to delays and shortages in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventions at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "netly calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that I would like to allow not only to enjoy the success of today, but for us to take this opportunity," he insisted on BBC Radio 4's agenda.
"Provide from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost of work.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the United Union unit at the plant, said that his members are more involved in: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One speaker to the government said: "We have presented a precise and difficult plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Vice-Chairman Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back one week" as the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which investigates Russian electoral interference, links between Trump and Russia and the potential obstacle to the justice of the President.
Korvidt Trump will raise the general of the defendants or not, and thereby endangers Mueller's self-esteem, has given food to Washington slags for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a leadership to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to look up.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
The trumpet said he would "between" not to kick Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate's hearing of both Kavanaugh and one of the women who called him for sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, something that delayed full voting from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It has not been a date. It may be this week, but I can and can see that it will be delayed one more week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But let me see, and I always like keeping the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not kept a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
Verten, Chris Wallace, asked what.
Sanders said that the lack of guidance was not due to a problem with TV reporters' game for the gallery, even though she said, "I'm not alone in doing it."
He called and that direct contact between Trump and the press came to increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before," he said, quite rightly without giving evidence of the claim. "I have seen a number."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump will also respond to questions when travelling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the President to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted to lead the reporters without shame, and almost curiously.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit for workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to taking into account the costs of applications which have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU, and the expected end is approaching in the autumn.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for everyone to dive.
That is why I will now repeat how much I value the contribution to all the additions, no matter what nationality they have.
EU colleagues, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is quite clear, and we want to be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having suffered a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessee newspaper.
Head coaches for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported that the damage occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapse, in a way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, WSMV, told Abercrombie that Abercrombie was finished operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and let Tennessee State still try to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college the second year, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five counts before he was injured in the Saturday fight, and is now up to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, follow the new plans for the conservatives
Determines whether Corbyn's success should be neutralized by attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Statcasse expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year - to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who take a lot, with a promise to offer reasonable buses.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money must be strengthened by the Government's desire to reduce the number of cross-border risks.
The fees, which are in addition to the current document fee, include the higher levels introduced two years ago on the booked number two and the rental bids, may be as much as three percent.
Statskassa expects the decision to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by residents outside the UK. This increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many well-being areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "splendent cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time occurred in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He assigned large construction companies to keep prices up by taking ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances on reasonable buses to fix Britain's "bud-house shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of promising proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and unreasonably terminations.
He wants and gives more power to build new buses.
May said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing the damaged housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right to be as simple for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom or for non-resident companies to buy buses that are too hard-working, British residents.
Too many people have the dream of their own lodging far away, and the humour of being a crossroads is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his ultimate ambition is to be manager of Scotland at a time.
The bulkhead (42) shines over the challenge of reliving the club from the north-east. They are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light in summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
"I would play for my country that plays.
I got a B-land battle, and that's it," Ross told the BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at Hamden with my father, and there has always been something that has brought me back.
The possibility can only come if I have succeeded as a club manager.’»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic says he doesn't have our best interests to come up with so many established names in such a big club, as he has previously refused approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
In the light of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are hearing from the Premium League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I’m going to get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the heart training device.
He then helped Alloa to get from drowning to third level, and turned St. Mirren, who was on his way to retreat, into the title winning series of the following season.
And Ross says he knows himself more comfortable now than he ever did while he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was enough a difference," he says about leading Alloa.
"I thought that being a manager was much better than being a player.
The right-hand sided out, because I did it well, tried well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to come through every week.
I still note it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it seems right to be manager.
I have always wanted to be manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body in my adult life."

Research shows that the perfect clock for a half-litre is 17.30 a.m. on a Saturday
Summer's heat wave has led to an increase in the appetite for heavy pubs in the United Kingdom, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the salt increased by 2.7 per cent in childhood - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: “The current sun, and the fact that England was part of the VM more than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars like a cell drink, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar as a cell food, received and marked the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem as if people will only go out for a drink.
Among the pubs and just the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen by three percent.
Paul Newman, analysts for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend that I have seen since the end of April.
The world, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the living room.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will continue to decline. A decrease of 4.8 percent per year in the room will be bad to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-driven operators. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a longer breathing room."
The total salt sale across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the issue of brand goods.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes results from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the reference index of the established industry.
One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents
One of the five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Study of 20,000 students on continuing reveal an increase in ‘false Insta’ profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the high scores they have have a 'head' profile they show their parents
One of five children -- some as young as 11 -- creates profiles on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20 000 elevations on the ongoing scale revealed a strong increase in “false Insta” profiles – a reference to the Instagram image division platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the high winnings they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who sneeze over the secret side of the 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who urged others to “elect me”.
The researcher, who was made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) on various schools, found that 40 percent of them between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's inconceivable that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle becomes the ‘Athletic voice’ of the Scottish Freedom Council
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board for Scottish Freedoms as a non-administrative director at the annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated volunteer in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
«Eilid has much respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's freedom society, and we are sure that freedom in Scotland can benefit from it in the government," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for the performers, and I hope I can contribute and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996, among its total four OL gold and is now a regular guest of BBC, was not able to go after a drink.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today, it's a month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The legends said that it was only time that could tell me if I came to be good again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've been very good again, learned to go back, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Splits Internet thoughts about breast pumping that compare mothers with dairy cows
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as ‘the world’s first silent breast pump, the technology company Elvie released a small set of advertisements inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers the advantage of milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-full label with cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you don't mark it, it's not spin, it's my balls."
He said, "Spr it out, pump it out, I will feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I will milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the sailors, and many say it highlights the “fear” in the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, just that the calves are trusted from the days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreet in an ame BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "I understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But why don't they use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their young?"
Another added: ‘For a remote traffic advertising.’
Others defended the ad, and a lady admitted that she thought the song was "confirmed."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have something if I still had an grandmother.
Pumping got me to feel like a cue.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a horrific advertisement directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or at toilets) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that screams or condemns the dairy industry.’»
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps, they say they feel like cows.
On the other hand, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no leads or pipes, and its discreet inside a amme-BH, something that gives women peace to move, hold their young, and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie pump is a so-called revolutionary product, that it sustains a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, I would like to put a searchlight on breast pumping and challenges linked to this, and at the same time demonstrate the unhappiness of peace that the new pump will bring, in a supportive and recognizable manner.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion fair in London, a mother appeared up to two on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while he used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move in silence to Telllers on the border to Texas
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even if monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strict policy introduced by the Trump Administration, making it harder to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that it will be possible to stand up and face a child could threaten their own ability to be in the country.
The risk of this increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would need to send fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed from the Congress of Immigration and Customs and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors for equal minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had nothing on their wheelchair from the past.
‘Approximately 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we must continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to the laws added to the rent, new rules have now been introduced to deal with children. The rules require that some of them have to be in court before a month has passed, in the past 60 days.
Many will participate through video chats, not at personal meetings, in order to have the trial of conducting an immigration trial.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer children are in stock, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to arbitrary outbreaks or escapes, they say they add in the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same thing.
People say that these concerns are greater at large plants like Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that one ignores the sign that children wear.
They allowed it to move children to the counter leader without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or if they hated friends, they could strengthen traumas that many have already suffered.
Syria requests the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now in war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who, and acting as Minister of State, said that the front forces were unlawfully on Syrian soil in the wake of the reduction of terrorism and “will be dealt with in it”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without interference," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "unlawful presence of the front."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, chiefly for training and counselling of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, opposed by President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that warlord country.
When it came to the problems of refugees, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed ‘some Western countries’ for having ‘distributed irrational fear’ about the environments that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebellion, has created an opportunity to continue pressuring political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejects a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including soldiers from the present-day front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, as "will be eliminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and road to the elections.
Moualem sets out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the articles of the current constitution", and to warn against disturbances.
Why Trump comes to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal sailors are likely to hope, the Presidency will soon end due to scandals and rule of law.
Without a doubt, it would be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that the stars have gone wrong.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating for the best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million stars in the best transmission time, from 1.7 million to four years ago, followed by Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million stars on evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured from, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivors", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She thinks of a trip to the country in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
Why? asked him.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied Scovell.
It's the maintenance value of the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families get together and health to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged sailors can take care of.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources with the "deep background" of the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of $15,000 (a plague hit by arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's disturbing description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I never come to see Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does to make it look like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created by "Pawn Stars", about the show that deals with Trump's employees and day-to-day disputes (enter a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was more than 25 degrees and the sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and looked at the MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He did not dare to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate commission and the future of the Supreme Hang in a thin thread.
"I remember when all these sparrows showed me before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of ghost, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside flows into the best interlocutor campaign
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania, its 17th district, sees a flood of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress which led to two sitting members fighting at the same seat.
The recently surrounded urban district of Pittsburgh promotes Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were illegally designed to win the Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has launched an arms attack on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties, their money channels, the Democratic Congress elections and the Republican Congress elections.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a close selection of specialties in Pennsylvania's 18th congress district.
The seat had been entitled to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given the democratics a little bit of a benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but escaped
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump organization's leader group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in an early appointment this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top managers informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and put an end to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the importance of the administration putting the assembly together, the diplomats said.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new arrests or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American service providers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of the introduction of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by a non-intelligible analyst who works closely with the administration and who speaks during the pre-exposure of anonymity.

A waiting for Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
As a result of the reports, Mueller must have turned his attention to the research on Trump's campaign designed with Russia to come up with an attack on our choice.
If the congress were to change rulers, Trump would have to stand up in this body, in which he prepares to convince the electors and possibly a jury of his equals.
It's a lot of 'what about', and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's case is inevitable – or for his opponent in Europe.
There is a choice to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the struggle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid years of bloodbath this led.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's invincible march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will happen to me if Trump kicks the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that he proposed last year to dismiss the president in secret, and speculated whether he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is incorrect.
"Corleis will react to me if the recently requested FBI investigator of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite the disturbing charges of sexual abuse and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we in the mid-election vote for a congress that holds Trump responsible?
If I fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me by guard to light the sabbaticals on the table.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they say about the Austrians, after an impressively undeclared in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, they will give a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken prevention midway player Graham Dorrans in doing his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
“I went into the fight with the threat of getting something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but everything is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then they came out in the second half and it was better.
On Thursday, there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully, I can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, and they got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure I can run and get a positive result.
The last year definitely has our strength, with everything that has happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The steel is good and the gutane trives; the training is good.
Hopefully I can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a study by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary calls to have that call," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not want to take your well-known time in the driveway.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a large part of it to determine the costs.
Get an economic advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with a cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you yourself are insured with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal campaigns before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so you appoint a person you trust to have supervision of your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a mandate for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make economic decisions and make sure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the possibility.
Do not forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Did you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's the legislator?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make the plan clear."
Men shot several times with Air Force in Ilfracombe

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public servicemen.
Without the possibility of communicating, no information has been received from assistant workers from Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the shield that had a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesiøa. Estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrates its 40-year anniversary when the sign and the tsunami hit.
Dongala is an area that extends over 300 km with a coastline on the north-west of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the berth of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel gain is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowoli, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, as a result of the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the west side of Dongala was hit by a tsunami that took the lives of nine people.
Indonesia lies in the Seismic Fire of the Pacific and becomes a smooth framework of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big shields and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major disaster on the west coast of the Province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of big storm hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A wave of 6,8 hits south in Java, the most popular island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that struck the South Coast and took the lives of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people are in the process of ruining life.
2010: A flood of 7.5 hit one of Mentawai's islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and took the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A little crash hit Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused damage and panic when people were reminded of the crash and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost lives caused by buildings like rust.
2018: Great fate hits the tourist island Lombok and takes the life of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Skulled down several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily beached.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and hunted for election in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor in Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, aimed at assault.
Following a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic elections, interference in the reporting of domestic elections and opposition to arrest.
As a result of the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when he tried to call the police to report a crime.
Palin becomes a prison of war in the Mat-Su prison, and is held against bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked, please enter the network.
Palin is facing three Class A abuses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and get $250,000 in fines.
He's also been targeted for class B abuse, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has been attributed to anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was appointed to attack his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the V.R. in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks in the world, involved in a report by the government in the world, and held a weapon while he was involved in the events.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after having linked the son’s electoral behaviour to PTSD from the time he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The shell, with a force of 7.5, released a tsunami and destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of arrivals is expected to rise in the next few days.
The Earthquake met right outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies north-east of the capital Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the scene hits, blooms on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the width.
Federal actors will rarely have a death penalty for suspicion in New York terror
Federal actors in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of being killed by eight persons -- a rare penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and bicycles on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘by will’ and that he ‘by will’ inflicted the serious physical damage, following a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be based on a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 points of objection, including eight hits for murder aimed at money printing, usually used by federal actors in connection with organised crime, and a target for the election and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for ‘significant planning and settlement’, said the actors and described how Saipov carried out the attack as ‘degradable, cruel and degrading’.
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss to family and veins of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", says the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's ten years since the last South District in New York has condemned the death penalty in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for having taken life from two doppelgangers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of information in the days and months that followed, following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, says it.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital, the police said.
He hasn't declared himself guilty at all points of reference.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are "decently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor's authority.
"We believe that deciding to go after death, rather than accept a declaration of debt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the dream from the event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory of my Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British independent party said that politicians had to " feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – one of them suggested that Theresa May's Members should rent the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, my parliamentary member Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had us out" now, if Farage was Brexit Minister.
The challenge that May faces is to send out its deep split lines has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wants to be in the EU.
The Minister of State struggled to keep up with the Chequers compromise on the right track after the attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Allied insists that it will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the withdrawal – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and 'caos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should be given a good standing and responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, I would be out now," he said.
Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but I must reject the Chequers'.
To mark his resistance to the EU, he said: "I do not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own promises in our own country.”
Bone rejects the claim that the minds of the people have changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and desires to be, is completely wrong”.
Brexit protests from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also took part in the march. He told the reporters, "I only say: Minister of State, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us selected at the beginning.
Be quick, drop the Chequers and right after»
In a message addressed to May, he adds: “Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises”.
Farage said that politicians must have "know the heat" if they were to betray the decisions made in the public vote in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that ‘I will not let them get away with it’.’
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want the political class, who is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the heat.
"We mobilize the people in this country that gave us the Brexit and should not get tired before we have become an independent, self-controlled, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center.
A handful activist fan with "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis made a joke about the conservative security issues they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have all the data systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a free friction limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total dad.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title after the warehouses give over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the warehouses from Mercedes had a great role in the process.
Bottas got a good start on the run, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position of the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the team.
Vettel was first in the depot and the fate of Hamilton came into traffic at the back of the loop, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after a little action side-by-side which made the Ferrari driver anti-willy had to let the inside be at risk so that he could not defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st day, on the back row and lay in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the course as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past the Kimi Raikkonen that lay in the fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but didn't have to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while Raikkon got the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who missed me.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both the first and the second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a joke by Senator Diane Feinstein on an election Saturday because of her insisting that she did not post the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she refers to the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
In a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the Witness purpose Ford had given the Senate commission directly, but also commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "slow and weak and talk user".
"The one thing that may happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are sad and bad and uncomfortable and talk nonsense," he said.
"When you look at publications and toys and then say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think of a dive?
Diane Feinstein, did you?
Thinking her answer... you put the document-- "oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Please wait.
Let me... no, let me not," he added, while he imitates the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to let it come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's remarks, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
«How I asked to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which he asked me to do.»
But her refusal did not fall into the good soil of the president, who commented at the Saturday's election: "I say dive, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court, who has been accused of three women’s bad sexual behaviour, the president suggested that the Democrats used the sentences for their own gain.
‘They are determined to withdraw power in all manner necessary.
You see the bad, the bad, the bad, they don't care about who they're hurting, who they have to run to get power and control," said the president in Mediaite.

Aeroplanes lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia will be hailed as a completely after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers arrived safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong post-skews continue to disrupt the area, and there are many who are trapped in garbage dumps in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthony Gunavan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it was wild.
He was back to make sure that the plane that was on the runway, the Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
Then he jumps down from the control tower when he threatens it collapses.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Rather he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid of a number of arrivals will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while I find bodies trapped in buildings. Many of them cannot reach me," said Bureauman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have damaged Palu, which will keep a mass graves on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have become a slave.»
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but I don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I beg everyone to work around the day to do whatever they can to help with evacuation.
Are they clear?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Aeroplanes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after a plane flight
The airline that operated an aeroplane which was controlled by a plane in Micronesia, the Pacific, reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before the fall.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not give any more details about the passenger, and the age and nationality of the passenger is unknown.
Local shipowners helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water when it tried to land on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people have been sent to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what causes the steering wheel and what's actually her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses threatened that the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wash through the water, which led them up to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it fell.
He said that the flight crews had panic and scream, and he suffered a headache that was not serious.
The U.S. Marine said sailors in the vicinity, who were working to repair a cow, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat they used to carry passengers to land before the plane fell on about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in the controllers of PNG-registered airlines their flights for the last 20 years, but none of them have fled with Air Niugini.
Analyticals make timeline over the night when women were burned alive
The Attorney General presented all the evidence on Saturday during the case before a man assigned to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnesses for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He produced for the jury how he hacked up recordings from mobile phones to find out what she was like when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the designated Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's night he died, unlike what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Tellis then asked if he was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers in about two weeks when he died.
But their mobile phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that one moment after Chamber's death, delete Tellis' messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He has wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence must end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passages polling pairs for the "racist" text message
A child-passenger in New York interrogates a couple to give her the shot based on discrimination after receiving a wrong text message from the mothers who complained that she was "one black person."
The couple have refused to be racist and compare the case with 'expression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother to two, was unhappy when he saw that the child passenger had added it, Giselle Maurice, was black when he first came to work in 2016.
‘NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, AND ONE SVART Person,’ wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending a message to her husband, he sent it to Maurice's babysitter, twice.
Having admitted her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Faxman gave Maurice's baby passenger the trigger, and said that the former African-American baby passenger had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, following The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for giving her the shot, and she's going to have $350 a day for six months for the job she would have had, even if it was without a contract where she would stay with the family.
"I want to show them that it is not right to do so," she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racist, and said that giving Maurice the shot was the only thing they could do after having insulted her, of which they were afraid that she would come to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to see.
It's not a racist.
Me is not racist," said the husband of Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've insulted care for your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the case with "expression," and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to arrest a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While this is happening, the public is quick to judge the couple on social media and criticise them for their performance and logic.
The layout behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not come to like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is difficult to see for herself how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the baby book about the wet teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it comes to Paddington, whom he describes as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was proud of the extent of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never broke," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who got something: you're proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughters were supposed to die and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When he landed, the daughters were taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice at all speed, where the doctor worked to save her life.
“Ned called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t threaten her to deal with it,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"So Nad called to say that she had come to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy in you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right back.
The doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slow on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to be shut off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't sit or scream because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who now had to care for the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," said he.
«I sat with my head bent while the tears fell.»
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was in her."
Providing women hang notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have fixed notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who think they're going to kill themselves to redefine themselves and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis, his son Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to know me as I know me every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that got infected.
"All he knew because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, because he was in a "real dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first who found Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that my brother-in-law may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "that people should know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never said he was lying or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before you mark me that he starts acting differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas 1st, when the children opened their gifts he didn't see them at the entrance."
He told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a great void in our family now.
Me is completely damaged.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts searching
"I thought that if we actually got something like what he was asking about – a limited research – we might get a little lonely," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid of the committee "fell together" in the middle of a party's bench.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They smell because of the clock.
The U.S. interval is only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans do not do so well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then had been secretary to Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're coming to the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 pipes in the Senate.
Number of landowners in North Korea "departures" under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seus referred to data from the South Korean Department of Association, and said it was 1127 falling off last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive fraud charges are the main reasons for the decline in the number.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
Most of the North Korean runners receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still purely technical in war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks will follow the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho U.S. owes him to get nothing back then.
"Without trusting in the United States, I cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot break our weapons first," Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says he can't be held in the loft.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the "histories" and said that he has too much temper to hold on to the "American".
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview with Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had acted in that way, she had been called "hysterical," said Pelosi about the burden of witness to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all objections that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh’s opening speech, he was very emotional and called at times with a lump in his throat as he spoke about his family and years of going on.
He criticised the Democrats in the Committee, calling out the objections to him "gross and a planned attack on his reputation," organised by liberal politicians who were concerned that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot be held in the high court because it shows that he is prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that the way he acted on his disability he validates, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi came with an objection when she was asked if he would try to get Kavanaugh to go off if he was elected to the high court, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can’t be in the high court, nor can he be in the court now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat he is concerned about potential Kavanaugh judgments against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions if he came to turn certain decisions into the upper row.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical, judgmental person in the high court who expects us to say he's nice," said Pelosi.
And women must bend the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We went when we were angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said she realized when she was angry, but developed a technique as she said to the person who made her so angry that she felt, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm crazy."
And then she just keeps going.
I think it was brilliant.
The tears work as a way to get the mind out, but there's a lot of misunderstandings.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I realized of my mind, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold tenant for whom I had always been free – and took me out at once.
"They never saw you crying," she said to me.
"You don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry, and they're watering because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987 Hart was taken to be on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could just as well sit still for election as president himself.
"I didn't actually think through it well enough," she said to me while she was lo, 30 years later.
"It was already seven other candidates who made the choice, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation 'Quick and the seven dwarves'.
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, he had not collected enough money, so he promised that he would only keep quiet if he could collect $2 billion.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave her $100 for men only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" he asked.
When she declared that she did not come to the election anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the speakers instead of the delegates, and thinking against gender discrimination, she began to cry under the speech.
"You should have threatened I had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder about how the press reacted when he realized.
"You should have threatened that Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"What the hell?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was watertight, and as the battle continued, a gap between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trump shot first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
The scale of this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken a home and set a tariff rate of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China is allowed to answer for every shot they fire off, and the next largest economy in the world is most likely not to go down with the first.
To bring Washington to an end, China must do what the United States wants, but to buoy up to the United States is too smooth for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the main call, the U.S. press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a smart political decision in Washington or Beijing can get both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have had to admit earlier," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that is damaged after more than seven years in war.
As he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas damaged by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All entry entries are now in place to enable refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and living bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to help build up the damaged country again.
But he pointed out that they are not coming to accept assistance or assistance under the conditions of the country that is in need.
Europe secures words in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they hit the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn, they reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, split most of the tournament, took the ball in the water from the tea at 4:00 p.m. and therefore gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did it well in all its rounds and became one of four players who have received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5&4 of the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in careers.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so glad to get the trophies back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He moves the staff to the countryman John Ram, who hit the American golf-legged Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I know an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four campaigns in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup through careers.
An outstanding statistics from one of the world's best players who has won 14 big titles and is disabled only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team slid to find the fairway the whole weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with golf at a high level through the whole tournament.
Jim Fury, the U.S. captain, said after a disappointing demonstration from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighting.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
Shut me up.
The hat of Thomas.
He's a standing captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guts and I'm proud to be captain.
One has to take off the hat.
I was played round."
