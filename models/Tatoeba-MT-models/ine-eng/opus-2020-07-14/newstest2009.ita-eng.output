The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative impact.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange took over the day before it was almost 6%.
Back to this bottom there's the stake in Wall Street.
So, too, from us, there is a reaction from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the local financial sector.
Crowd of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges have experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day, have subsequently eliminated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index during the day has eliminated almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilizing to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese action movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares at Sydney Stock Exchange were lost more than 5%, but at the end of the losses were estimated at 4.3%.
The Thai-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets all over the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
On the other hand, there is a risk that other countries also suffer from the consequences.
Roads of American action
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion had to be allocated (almost twelve billion Czech crowns).
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares on Monday lived a street and the main indexes of the shares recorded the largest crolo from over twenty.
The Dow Jones index has dropped by almost 7% and a curve of similar sizes has been observed for the last time in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress surrendered: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (approximately twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, must define some details of the intention before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday said that to the agency Reuters, the chairman of the banking and financial services committee in the Barney Frank room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can revive the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, you will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, you can reach the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've made a big move forward."
"We have clarified our different opinions on how to present the package for market stabilisation," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire from financial companies non-derivable mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's still necessary to bring the recovery plan forward, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly affecting the markets in the stock markets that are rapidly rolling.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement to the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market following the Congress' decision.
But for now it is not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope to be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still make many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the payment of the rest of the sum in the event that it will have the impression that the programme does not carry out its function, blocking the subsequent $100 billion and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, the Congress may exercise its right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has been maintained, i.e. to obtain the funds to buy the passive mortgage values, the price of which is raised because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We have developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Republican Senator said.
The progress in the negotiations is also pleased with the American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Frato said that Bush is satisfied with the positive move on Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market as well as for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relates to aid to home owners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of mortgages that it will purchase with the aim of lowering monthly interest rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Mark: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share their losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that this week the representatives of the Congress have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
Sugar to the last blood: MP3 readers against cell phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
This makes it clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you are looking for an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you will find it difficult to buy a high-quality high-quality giraffe to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not choose as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is no objective reason.
But if on your drawers vinyls are filled with hard-rock, jazz or blues probably, a giraffe of the kind as a minimum comes to a dream.
It also works with portable music, that is compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the heads of twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes, there's plenty of space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the battery.
Some high-quality music readers are able to do much more than simply read music, but what they don't even make cells for error.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone and send SMS, you can read music and videos, both register and have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer.
It's a little miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can take pictures of anything.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on the cell and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cells can read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical readers (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, you do not know that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, look for another battery for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even worse ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem arises when music is downloaded into the cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Surely music can be recorded directly on memory cards, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapters for minicards that are not used in cell phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most of the cells and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library arranged according to the names of the performers, album name, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The readers are easier to handle, the cells can do more.
When you choose a particular device, you are especially interested in battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If the music serves you especially from the bottom and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, it is enough for any cell that reads MP3.
This can now, clearly at any cell.
You don't have to worry too much about which cell phone or reader they recognize.
The MP3 readers all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile Internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a reader-cell phone.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and is usually limited only to hits at the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either via GSM,internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their cell phone back.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruit in the bag while the MP3 player stays forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you're always behind the caps or at least the auricolar without wires.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers has.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of readers cells will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest costs normally less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the common cup.
The best and technically equipped cells and also with a 3.5 mm grip for the common cupboards cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily more economic (see our choice) makes it really anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling for a time with the common stereo or maybe the giraffe, is obvious.
There is no risk of misbehaving the launch of the mobile Internet network and as a result of a giant data transmission bulletin.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which is included in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones also do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you also want to buy a low cost MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized mobile - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the comfort of the service so you get closer to the same MP3 reader.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more roads, which walkman cells have the same user scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, CTU also confirmed it, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradox situation will be created - for some customers of mobile Czech operators, SMS will cost less than home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you would really want to start the fight .
It may sound absurd, even where we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators are pleased to see that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, it is also often emphasized by the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who once expressed that there was no other operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network is not likely to have many possibilities anymore. (The rest might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant reduction in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time before the entry of squads such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they sounded similar voices in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the accounts for the examples, we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to conquer over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic belongs between the other U:fono.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-work.
In order to be able to actually operate it, there are many less customers than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move also the bet on a group-bersaglio not long ago.
This operator points out specifically on men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator who likes and whom you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also claim a concept similar to that in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepýk: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
More from the point of view of services is relatively satisfactory."
In the Czech Republic, no possibility is given to mobile network operators.
But it seems almost certain that if there's ever an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have much expectations.
Mobilking's accent will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničková, the spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this view.
On the contrary, they try to do everything because you don't believe any competitive potential.
For a while it does not hide its interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the Novera GTS Group, which would thus take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said the spokesperson for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe better times will come.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual operator should have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far, no one with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeně of the press section of Telefónika O2.
The specificities of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
The spokesman for the T-Mobile printer Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial business project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
We have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be considered as a horizontal one."
Vodafone focuses his attention rather on achieving his 3G licence applications.
Add Miroslav Čepýk : "We are open to negotiations of potential virtual operators and this is especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most producer from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Then why facilitate the arrival of such a competitor?
The nuisances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators have something they can remember from the same side.
Perhaps the high pressure pushes against CTU during the period of U:fon creation towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public information access from CTU's websites.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of competition in the mobile telephony market has been slightly strengthened beyond anything with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another competitor would be on him and, above all, on his superior services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest by the Czech regulators.
This is not just the attitude of the CTU which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, in relation to all the problems, has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa said, from the Section for External Relations ÚOHS, in answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office that must defend the interests of consumers and also take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the undercutting of prices does not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
It is truly shocking in the whole situation that the almost emotional harmony of these three operators is due to their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is put on its own.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrols is the result of the coincidence and competition struggle.
"The section has not found evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On a market like this, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion, it must be dominant by force.
But even if we did not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators are acting in such a strange way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Dischargeing responsibility in ČTÚ in telecommunications is a pretty common trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the picture.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of CTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the law on recently approved telecommunications was updated, despite the fact that many experts were expected to improve the situation from this point of view.
This is what the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
As long as we do not know, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephony services, but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile telephony services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the expected people.
The magic is that the company against the operator is depicted as a classic company client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit a similar advance.
"If the cases mentioned above, of which we will be interested, could be in breach of the contractual conditions, and could focus on the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," answered the question in question, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile telephony operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from a similar attitude.
In other words, from the activities of these companies, they bring an indifferent profit at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýky warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a per cent of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot have it as the usual customers of mobile telephony operators."
But that is exactly what should be a strange minimum for the CTU.
There is also another issue for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to extinguish similar activities and if he does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who do not have any idea of it and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no more expensive
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - the market too small, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries, in these cases, regulators have been involved, not mobile phone operators, but their clients.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, he came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he agreed with others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch each other’s whole case as a bubble patch.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we don't throw the spear.
If the feedback is correct and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will be back on the bike.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficult ÚOHS could remain impassable to the refusal (discrimination) of the other parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech enno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new Czech national editions.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of the recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new registrations of the national year "Kde homev møj".
The new registration of the inno was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – seat with male or female voice, chorus step and instrument edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kniežinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the Inno are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the national song to be one of the most beautiful inni.
He has already told the radio "Český rzhlas" that he has specifically chosen to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"At first I tried to have care that both and even the choir have the clear word, that the text is understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anniversary will be celebrated next year on the 175th anniversary.
The song "Where home møj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Til accompanied by the music by František Škroupa.
He has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it his own.
The first piece of the song after the founding of the Czechoslavacchia in 1918 became the natural part of the national inn.
E’ remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Czech Republic autonomy.
How the "new" sounds inno
The Wednesday MDD of Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic tessera
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic wallet in their pockets will be released in the metro, tram and bus instead of the paper ticket.
Right now if you can search for about 100 million people who own their Opencard password.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days a year (which will come from the first January 2009) and at the same time make their own paper available in the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Museum, Můstek, Nádraži Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Cutgliandi can be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the sportsmen in the subway stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased online and on Opencard it is downloaded on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a sport with personal format that will help those interested in buying on the Internet and will also record the credit acquired on their paper." said the spokesman for the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition, in libraries you will be able to load the electronic clips on the Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the subway entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to the forgetters of the tickets and the passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Budjejovicá, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrny concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead than from the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard key and before payment of the cut, you will load it above.
Electronics are worth tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport, there are the driver(s) with which the time and zone validity are verified," explained Filip from Ropid’s organization, which sets out the timetables for Prague’s collective transport.
The urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated in the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore unnecessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at a given point next to the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the loads.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loads, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the cutting is done, can once again go to the self-service ATM, where the cuttings are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups of the Sudites addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is in addition to the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Shumava district" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco agreement – all of Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be sure of the promises for which the American units arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "People who have the destiny of Šumava with all the heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope for the brutality, the lack of respect, the incomprehensibility, the oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate on Shumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a state to us foreign, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed for anything, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," it says in the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the supposed fear of the sales seat by "the Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president had to doubt the Germans' conviction, it would be enough in the district to organize a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the U.S. or to live under the United States' standards.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the post-war war, according to some witnesses, it appropriately describes the expectations of the Germans then of the Sudites.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least be aware that they would have been moved from the republic, only a few of them allowed a whole kind of possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudan.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budjejovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in prison in Holštýn , the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These thought that once you returned home the blind would have made him comfortable," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war, who lived in Czechoslovakia, reported to him that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on volantins.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the wheel.
And remind him of putting the belt on before he leaves.
He wants to play in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not finally professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially stories of people who will affect their emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a blood pot there's the word "payer."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his own life at a time of distraction.
The spots will "spavent" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents can be seen in common.
This is how you promise to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech streets.
Spots have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Drivers' carts and sticks
"With the drivers, the caroto and baton system works.
The carat for them is for example when they pass with red and so save time.
The baton is the danger of the fine or the incident.
The risk to drivers should be remembered," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán dell's Hospital Na Homolce.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn danger drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Israeli interim government chief Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the restoration of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that means that we will have to return almost all the areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We land a certain percentage of these territories, but to the Palestinians we should leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He has admitted that any refund will also include East Jerusalem .
"Those who want the security in Jerusalem and above all do not want the ruins or spies to pass them, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the accent of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of injured people.
According to the first it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mountain of the Temple, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, which he believes is the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to renounce the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Sciit Movement); they will have to renounce the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (Sciit Movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after the incident: Are Stewards illegal on the buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padova of the Student Agency’s Pullman Company, the question was whether Stewards and passengers could move on the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the Steward activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident of last week with which he lost his life a 22-year-old guest was caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure seat of the pullman, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an incident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of the coffee or newspapers.
Depends whether the bus is fitted or less on foot according to the traffic book.
If the passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing places, confirmed it at Aktuáln†.cz the director of Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he said his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regulation of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The law of road traffic only recognises the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," says spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law is not enough of this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
Everything here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are pedestrians and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with pedestrians with maximum speed higher and longer handling without the pedestrians with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the background problem in the driver movement on the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
It's not even safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can blow his head off."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop, obviously the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the urban pullman or on the tram.
The carrier must solve the safety of the Stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of law, the problem is not solved.
Janchura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the support services..
This one uses about two hundred.
Even after the incident, the Director does not consider their work as dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the profession of the steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenditure," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a section of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stereos on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have guests, we've been fighting since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal incident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
It's a huge tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young guest in the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency course without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The pullman driver tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but he hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the retirement of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these positions in the long-trailers, they are impeccable."
The company has in mind to denounce the driver of the truck.
The Agency will not await the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to specifying the movement of Stewarts on the bus.
"They have not achieved any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much the pullmans, they take more of the score system, maximum speed on the ‘autopath’ and use the cell phone during the drive," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesman Havelka, who is responsible for the police and security officers.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There are no words missing in the letter from the Director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday, "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of savings funds" could be formed through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution's unit with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive step for further links in the banking sector of the Landen.
Thus it is read when a Board of Directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
Because the WestLB crash is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having noted time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time limits the search for a future solution.
Of the links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Rescue Fund because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB is certainly already talking about it for a while, even by Francoforte.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas, at the time of the presentation of the bill of the first half of the year, reported that a merger of the house by via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Deka's Board of Directors, who is brought in half by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with West LB on joint contracts.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The talks, however, have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Dela Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most in Frankfurt's business square, not the first time it is about consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that the Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
From this association to three, there was nothing wrong with that.
Once the projects were published, the Asia Regional Bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
Still, we've always been thinking about a merger of the Deca-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl, president of Helaba's Governing Council, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
In addition to this, it seems that we believe in cognition, that it is necessary to bring the different homes of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament's election has passed, a Bavarian Landesbank meeting with the Bavarian Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
For Helaba, it's not all good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, partners will be missing hand.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although it has now overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Asia-Turingia savings fund association, which participates with 85 per cent of Helaba, has put the chain up to the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NorthLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to fight the various business models of individual houses.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question, with which the future of regional banks would be assured, would not have yet been answered by the German savings fund association.
Finally, the West LB division could also come out, which of course is not desired.
So the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
It will see how the individual parties' reunification with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them is a barber of 5l. of the Kaiser brand standing a massive barbecue and shows about 200 travellers which are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena gave Luca a package and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, they leave tonight at 23.45 four runners with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , scheduled arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three couriers are especially reserved for Italians, while only Brazilians travel in another one.
In a parking corner the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's nothing to the Italians.
The frame that carries a long hat with false furskins and a couple of glasses with large silver sticks belongs to it.
They've been going to Octoberfest for 5 years, this year they're 3 tours.
The nighttime, day after day at the party, returns at 22.30.
Nighttime would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian rules of authenticity, the case of illness and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses go around the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian targa on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 p.m. at the parking near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put your yellow hat on.
On it to the left was written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the beer tends to open, it means running!", says Mark in the morning.
"Run!" ran and occupy the positions at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we're blocking, and not all the yellow shrieks sitting on the same benches, split into the right space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, url Marco.
And don't forget to give up.
"Protest to the security service, that we behave well!
Once you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "We'll meet again here at 22,30 p.m., understand?"
She's already going for the party.
On the road, an attack as follows the trails of yellow breeches to the trees, to the road signs and even to a advertising cartel of a large popular Bavarian party.
You want to be ready to fight the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the weekend of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, it is 50 thousand, which go to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where Italians are the first place with 200 medical care in front of English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the trend of the Hofbrähaus.
1. Insomnia nights for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and has also stressed that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis has begun at the weekend.
The real estate funder Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a German bank consortium to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
In the end are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier has been refinancing in the short term – which is no longer possible due to the market challenge.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves were reduced by 95% over the EUR 2.37 million, even the share of the capital actually fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net returns from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, the benefits of increases both in demand and in certain actions as well as the liquidation of lending transactions fell by more than 70% over Euro 5 million.
Only through higher incomes from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs resulting both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was sufficiently moderate with around 16%.
The former public financer after being privatized in 1990 lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were carved out in Aareal Bank.
As income in classical state funding was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects by private and state investors (PPPs) and has been diversified internationally.
The Real Estate Hypo must now dampen the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, 2/3 had been reduced.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Deffa is an important source of funding for state and infrastructure.
He is more dependent on refinancing in the market between banks compared to other institutions, because he does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Real Estate Hypo needs annually for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international monetary markets for the most unfunctioning.
Other sources make it felt, which means that by the end of 2009, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The president of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee said otherwise that the HRE group will not need the monetary markets for a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the profitability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is expected for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the impossibility of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank to what it learned was to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The shareholding course costs 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They're good enough for the exchange courses.
While the previous degree of debt is almost irrevocable, the courses of loans are postponed.
In particular, the Muts of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate understandably the events with a maturity over 2009.
Before Della HRE's loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their courage must, after strengthening the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which, with the Depfa's emphasis on the crisis, must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, one can count on an amalgamation of the annuality by the end.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But you are concerned with the information covered by the partial stabilisations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create, in particular, long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if it divides itself from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the recovery of losses for future payments of the compensatory rate on value added.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should come to the Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Japan exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had the guts to go to school.
I live at the borders of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find her on my own, and fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed just as we did in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive at the piano from 8:40 p.m. to start a brief conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I am not the kind who speaks willingly in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had the uniform school, I was put on an old mother's lap, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I was put in front of the cathedral, and I tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..."-- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have bubbling, laughing and making signs, and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
This one I've known since my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessico of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me was embarrassed, for her it was an honor to sit next to a exchange student.
The rest of the lesson was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was attacked in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and laughed and dried me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German breads.
I had cooked with spices, salsicines, lemon and algae salad, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu wraps..
To say the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new flavor.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the room, brr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Good done by herself, prepared enough artistically, with the hope of making the boy known during the recreation.
I read it in my junkie Manga.
I'm curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them that I would want to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I've been reading for years with fervor and mangas.
And to better understand the comics and culture that contain, I started learning a little Japanese before or after.
I was absolutely convinced that I would come back once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They have a lot of us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a scarf escapes when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be found if, when they behave in the same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of scientific knowledge have been published on the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address other species and ask questions about the feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not conflict.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That's what makes him pretend to be dead, run away or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the side frontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing of short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation on the assumption that man is even different from other primates is thus admitted.
Another dramatic particularity should be introduced in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is linked to language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs much from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analysing it through its experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The process of animal consciousness without regard to their content could be analysed, and this is what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: they could both be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
What, then, is the meaning of feelings?
I owe them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupys the memory of the work.
In view of this, the feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and, in particular, human beings.
The talking nature creates subtle shades of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In view of this, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that feelings are more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and of the head palaeo, similar to Jack Pankseep, which however concentrated more on the palaocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the extended feelings of the species.
At purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indisputable.
Pankseep brings up arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears to be afraid is likely to be so with the senses in both cases: but how could it be found if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
Does a crash in case of danger run away as if he too felt the fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural confrontation continues to be of help: rats and human beings have similar palaeonencephalus, scarfs not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings, how would you like to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level, at the same time giving up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered a myopic, but I prefer to take a step forward rather than constantly kick against a wall.
I'm for the record a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platinum: Transfer to Poland and Ukraine
Vice-President Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the master countries of the house are in the March table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be allocated to the Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN is unable to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP information agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer from it."
A number of exhibitors of the first division were condemned only in the last season for manipulation, and at the end of the last time the beginning of the Law had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid Ribblet Angry
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he's grown up with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star has declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adult.
He's angry with the ribs.
The War of the Roses is delayed by the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the betrayals she would have come to know only after separation.
The occasion for the "spoil of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adult husband was a clear downturn: he would be "inaudible", he said on Thursday to "New York Daily News", which "Meg repeats and reworks the story of our relationship for the next time".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack, the sedician son who had had together, once again "is publicly remembered the pain and overcoming, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on in any case.
I'm lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Check rates for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places are already priced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already above 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak deduction of the dollar, which would lead to a "quiet desire to travel from American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the drop in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
The trend in the first quarter also points to:
Due to the collapse of the kerosene, the passengers of the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-acting fuel flights would be even more expensive until 29.2%.
From April to June, the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell on average of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, however, price changes in the first class and business were much weaker.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices increased by 11.9 %, by 23.6 % in the second quarter.
With regard to domestic German flights according to the study, prices were even reduced.
The reason for the price fluctuation would, on the one hand, be lower economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has been exacerbated.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition through the open sky agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit agreements at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe was 24 airlines.
HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a chief.
In Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoff Klein increases the landing of fortune for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came late in the game and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passing it on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," cried Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg Arena cabins.
It didn't happen, but in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monk also found heard in the high spheres.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol cancelled and raised the thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach leader of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded the same way: here's the second goal!
No change in position.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "resolved" himself.
For the 1 to zero those in Hamburg, they must thank the head of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the players many poor Gladbach could not have hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
Spectators have already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the shining class on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
He has the presentation, that the table's provisional certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the sample than of its HSV domination.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen sufficed at the FC Bayern – finds himself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling," Jol relaunchs.
After the vote was taken
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package has temporarily crushed the Dow Jones of 700 points.
This was the greatest loss of points in the space of one day of his history.
Later down came back a little later.
Around 20:30, the world's largest stock exchange barometer has scored/recorded with a good 5% in cash on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it just dropped us 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could have done it.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank have just dropped 10%.
Just a few days before the big investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the financial funds were to be allocated to cover the so-called mortgage documents.
However, the sum must be paid not in a hit, but in degrees.
If the State were to withdraw it, it had to keep the stock options sheets of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with a proper rate of deductions, to reduce the debt for the State's cash.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze rapidly, it is now up to you to die for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, with which they get additional salt/spink/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens Euro-American research probe used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What surprises the students for years: the roots do not behave exactly as we would expect in accordance with the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year repatriated Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study strongly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible of the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space students are only known for about 10 years.
From her there is obviously an attraction force, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is seen.
It itself is completely invisible, that is to say, do not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of a kind, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of cosmos.
The tourists captured in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists captured in Egypt would be once again free, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from the Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue treaties are already under way.
The Germans are always in the eye of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists captured in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with the Egyptian state television, the Arab publisher Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hosts have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on a trip to Cairo.
There is still little clear delay in a shooting before the release of the hostages: therefore, the kidnappers would have been prepared for the completion of the kidnapping after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, before the Sudanese army would have killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the official said.
It would be "just a deal to take over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by fire at 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers were afraid of their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to set women free after payment of the ransom.
Men would have to remain detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected a position on the relationship .
Patriarch's abuses "carried to suicide"
Years of abuse by the patriarch brought a woman to death, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that she regularly bothered her daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Treise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Treise harassed her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he came back to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a long time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who were a great surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "molled with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself by suffocating yourself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The League and the Blessed."
"I didn't bother her sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "He is a very strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This sad saga ends with the victim who takes his life away.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be ended before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
"In other words it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the allegations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents that were lost contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and Iraq's security forces' capabilities.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of over £80 billion after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given 14 billion sterlings to protect the 2.6 million savings deposits of Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the savings funds, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion sterling loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be due each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have acted prudently... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million sterling in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlings to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company, told the BBC that he believed it was unfair.
"It is annoying that those institutions that have acted prudently in the market in the re-entry of houses are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see which options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are non-participating mutual organisations, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk comes with 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five pounds per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the rise in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Refuses the security to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court rejected a request for security from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him 50 million takas ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many allegations of corruption that we are facing against her.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next weeks, but his party, Awami League, asked that the country's temporary government supported by the military first day of total freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the claim for bail for Sheikh Hasina, bringing that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical treatment," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explained that he needed security to return to the country from the outside to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home is expected after October 17th, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government attached to the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan campaign anti-polo
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that children cannot reach Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that would not attack or impede thousands of people from the staff who carried the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to oblige the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed for an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV sows doubts about ITV's independence, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would ariser its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Minister to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case was made by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to the actions of the Administrative Officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors were removed for political reasons.
The Public Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of accusations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or tried," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said that lawyers had been fired for expired performance.
But later it turned out that the licensors had not been assessed any longer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the licensor had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the judicial action against the Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring forward cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and finally regained his position.
A number of other officials from the justice department were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical about the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that it covered a primary responsibility in the dismissals, which he had devoted to his role as leader and had been extremely distracted during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
Meat Loaf's epic will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for its inno episode Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will return his special gold prize to the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to earn recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track track of the album hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for the awards this year, being in the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that pass things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, demanded a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album was almost nine years old in class and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after crashing the stage.
In 2007, he soon got his hands on cancelling the concerts.
It came out later that it had a cyst on a vocal string.
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just for use.
But also many veterinarians and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The narrow road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet of width and 120 feet of length, it looks more like a dusty oak than an active road traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal athlete.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner transition for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers have long been close to saying that they were hit by the steep road simply because it was one of the last remains of the past Mrs.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in having it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Land of the District Municipal Committee, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to stay in the city's hands, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3 District.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to regulate and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seats, including some to be used for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this abandoned village and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a clear historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the photo set for the album cover of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was the neck of immonism, brandy of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "genrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, bringing that part of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A little nostalgic to the city in the way of extinction"), published part of a talk of the city's history that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an unusual door without exit, also dark day and limited doors of storage in rustic iron and windows with the sarachins, with old days of weeks flowing along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same in a recent evening.
A rat ran gently through the back of the road near a door leading inside CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of empty beer from 22 ounces of juice near a group of fresh daily abandoned.
A few passersbys said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but they suggest they'd need to be a bit adorable.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thought that some people underestimated the attraction of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: English immersion
At this point in Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member in California's studies and the senior director of the educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To really attract Spanish voters is a complicated matter.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African and Latin students have significantly less probability of graduate than white students, "which is true.
In order to combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transit bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in meeting learning differences.
Let us take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the higher level test in the 2008 mathematical status exam.
An equally surprising 93% of fourth-class students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of the skills and an attitude of the type "no excuses".
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months after you were unable to figure out what it was".
"It works," he observed "for us."
Would Obama take a school as a Sixth Street Prep model to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-term supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the point when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than ignore them or banish them.
The oil melts sharply and renews the economic fears
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
The future of the grain fell from 7 percent to $99.80 at the New York stock exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 at the bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, markets of raw materials have been driven out of the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a few hurricanes powerful in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 in June, prices were raised to almost $90 in the barn at the beginning of this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors on Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the brake negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contamination.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year while household oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts of oil and gas prices by about 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second fourth marks a team record.
After spending more time on everyone with the uniform of the Jets in the last eight and more seasons, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it happen on the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a lift.
"Never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalled the grizzling of the threatening clouds that overwhelmed them with a fiasco game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symphony made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for other two touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the passes to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing games, the defense severely hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a waving launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
The security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fan.
The last tournament, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken back the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely had jumped a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets have ever signed in a room.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets Eric Mangini's coach said, "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
When both were told - the Jets gave 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked much more the second quarter than the third."
There were a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Gebrselassie resting above his record of the world
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his same record of the world to the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to race 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favourablely flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie sets up the 26th record of a world career that has produced a world championship or a record of the world at every distance from a mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie jumped the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing - perhaps in a way too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees from departure, 55 degrees from arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders like Gibraltar and Paul Tergat del Kenya went to the long distance, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had the potatoes at the pulpits and missed a week of training.
Of course, the rest left her fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
It was a bit critical - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having orchestrated its races excessively, usually avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on apripist as if it were a middle-ground race, and putting world records over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of the skills of Gabrielassie as a marathon.
With the step of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point of the road at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed with Gebrselassie after the climbers were out.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final commitment to separate from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving her best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, now a German city, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
He lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad incident, but he was cured to win Berlin, making his best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon he ran.
She ran a race by doing well the calculations, allowing a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to compete with a great distance, taking it back after about 18 miles and a half.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the Orlando suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, the quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first black city built in the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown Skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop understanding it in Florida's tourist guide produced by the Depression era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what's losing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential appointment, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many here remain disparate from the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradise of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre, but also an example in the shadows of the rural culture of the South Blacks - sometimes disfigured, sometimes awarded - born by the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both fair and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who all here are called Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Wee Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a grancass both in life and in literature, Hurston took the readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with the finishings in white, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and whatever fits into the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This wasn't really about Fodor.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston killed her by quoting men who sing big solo songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston was swimming in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a Chevrolt triumph, smoking and wearing pants in a city that today also enjoys dignified clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while others were smothering.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, dondolandese on his chair on the courtyard on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "they never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he once was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a dead end in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there was no great commemorative ceremony, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their abandonment to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, in addition to other things, ended its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the fifties, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the door of the community's home.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff to the people who were sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed once.
They got a coconut from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request for forced integration to the Supreme Court, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the degregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, destroys the cohesion of Eatonville and reiterates the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hug your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This was hard, it added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher-- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk for Hurston's dead tomb and started fighting for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an infamous biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the library cabinets, reintroducing it into the American cannon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had crossed the lights of the coast again.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five courses of the highway rose, brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a simpler way: "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new library at one level (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repatriated and decorated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
An early request for permission is required for most of the interview, to some things - like the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat-ass teacher, with a weak for the bright red, still fear that their island community will be broken.
However, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, shock and confusion like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is a sincere civil affair that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And also those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they have just entered here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a beautiful city."
Here in New York, we're all talking about money.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not be able to stand in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, on the ground above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "gross day in office" every day from the 1929 crone.
The factories shake metal wheels for the way through the marches, carrying muffin vases for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condoms carrying, like human mules, 50 and scattered shirts appear to a stick on their backs.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the marches, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new book of savings on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the façade so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break to my subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a number of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's gym, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service gym, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those before me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for the same reason.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from the places where the pendulums, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island, are made.
They have taken the money from the so-called trifts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and tradesmen who were in front of me, imprudent for another collision, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security at Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman in my Chinese trusted supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her emaciated Director General Dick Full in the whole family, as if lying to a bad colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform portinia, almost fifty-nine of my condominium, has changed the subject of our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
Muslim tomb profaned while Austria turned right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the right wing of the Party of Freedom and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Città vís Islamizzazione" in Antwerp, Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signals like those road representatives of the mosque with a red line passing in the middle.
The police blamed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right have won a lot to the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have traced with the spray Hebrew symbols such as the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the extreme motivations guided by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of profanation, which occurred at the end of Ramadan, months of religious relevance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with extremely anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobia critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of Freedom who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against sails and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the food they are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and mines, leading to political symbols of a continuing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have set the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star of sexual abuse on minors, was forbidden to travel in France and Spain from the court.
The Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that controlled him of his desire to go to Spain by crossing France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after the magistrates had been given the proof of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, a true name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's detention in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's detention, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present."
Glitter, 64 years of age, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice on his expected departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A spokesperson for the Kent police said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have suitable complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual crimes recorded in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two boys aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it pass the passport check and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
At the end, he arrived at Heathrow's 3rd Terminal on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard successfully asked for an order to include him in the register of sexual offenders.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuses on children.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to draw the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No pockets, no flying, no clothes from the first.
Only the essence of the great masters of the flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes interpretation, to look at the appearance released by man or woman.
The artist's on one side.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go into the scene.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some songs to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These portraits "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sorrow, joy when they are in the scene ... and catching the public.
In order to capture the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to draw them into a scene,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to bring back singers, guitarists or dancers using a stone camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remind the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the design of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, at the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are listed in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject" "Veteran athletes' portraits".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I want to draw people back, know them and be able to penetrate them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you don't even know at times or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, titled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, on the 20th of the route de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llossa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "gazzard"
It is surrounded by places that he still does not know and it concerns unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llossa is at work with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Since he has always been a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project he is currently working on "is a gambling" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw pass through the city of Acquedoto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Los Perros" was, as prognostically, the figure of spic to the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llossa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens's book "Our mutual friend", filled the venues of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public who had fled the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, revocated as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "the pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "miss of inspiration", with an intense documentation work, editing and continuous recovery; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effimary experience," said Vargas Llossa, arguing that, on the contrary, "there are effects" and that "makes the most anti-conformist people." That's why he invited writers to "do not give up" and "take responsibility" of their vocation.
The time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, keeping him from running
The celebration of the races that should have been suggested on the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tournaments selected for the races had found that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather went against this festival, preventing two days of celebration on three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second race of bullies.
The cartels included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival had a regular run only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming out into triumph, after he had toored with taste and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two races by picking up health and an ear, given more by the public than by the race itself.
The worst among them was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutches, the figurines of most of the public were earned.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the stop point in Alava
Five less ten in the morning.
The agents have the upper hand with the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they give themselves to the escape.
The agents have intimated the height of the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after following them, managed to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communication of the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public documents.
The incident occurred when some of Alava road officials were carrying out a control of the transport on the N-1, where it was through the municipalities of Arminón.
They insisted on stopping a van for the inspection when the driver, crossing the orders, rushed swiftly and crossed the stop.
The agents went to the search until the vehicle, after a few kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants ran into a forested area.
Ertzaintz's agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2.178 kilograms of hashish they carried and took note of once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the matrix was "doubled" because it did not coincide with that reported in the van documentation, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to the police station to conduct the appropriate proceedings and to be available to the court in the next few hours.
Arrests actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
Actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesman for the California road.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "was deeply shaking the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the car from the car with brisk maneuvers forward and back. Making retromartial, it happened several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first sight apparently had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear was stopped in a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
She was this person to alert the emergency services, because "she was concerned about the life of Locklear."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and that's why the agents led him to a specialist drug and alcohol center to submit him to a test.
According to a spokesperson of the police, the actress has been cooperative and the hypothesis of alcohol abuse has been eliminated since the beginning, even if "as observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substances and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19:00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, the Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls upon the Andalusian Federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
Izquierda Unida's general coordinator and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, today confirmed that he would be waiting for the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former adviser to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the charge of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been counseling in the Civilian Council so far.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted us to have the greatest transparency of this kind of investigation."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
By inspiring himself at Episidios Nacionales di Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci represents in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish rebellion against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the famous novelry, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría in charge of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television ministry in the future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community commissioned him three years before turning a commemorative film for the second century of May 2th. The director had agreed that the story of bass on the novel Episodios Nationales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid for Garci have represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to re-establish the appropriate scenarios and customs to bring back a "stupid Spain which has failed to choose the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence has led to a huge delay in development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII has observed Garci.
However, the record regrets that it did not receive funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los phantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some of the scenes that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the Rever's record at the beginning, influenced what is his usual work practice, the setting with the actors, with which he often tries to try before turning together those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "amigrant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in the theatre and cinema to know what's happening in the field where he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of which are part of the Sangre de Mayo cast, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - its Sangre de Mayo, Seven tables de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles blindes - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At the beginning you believe you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to just turning a movie more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon regains the civil essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Civilian ballerina brings honor to another ballerina as well as to Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, father of Catalan (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana district, and at the age of three, moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballerina and a specialist in eastern dances.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the caliber of Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who has witnessed a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she's offering me this character.
He maintains the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the bat" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also comes into this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in the "Open Door"; and that of Maestro Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what she was a student.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The instrument also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been all round, and who have always had many spasms."
In the work there is also in some ways the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially at that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you, because I think it is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given period of history and now no one remembers it and so much less considers its operation as something of value" the Bayon supports.
The show will begin today, at 20.30 a.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un un a reincarnated poet" also closes the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reincasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, comes back in the activities programmed by the Advisorate to the Culture of the Andalusia Junta to celebrate the "Triennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chop of light", which was opened last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusian Joint acquired a total of eighty copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reincasado", under the care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gave the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of America, in front of the overwhelming idea that Newman had gone.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence."
Nobody was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and the markets, with the self-esteem from the American people to the ground, to the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, the men are so helpless and there are good people to admire, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it contained the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and twenty causes, from the foundation for the fight against drug created in honor of the firstborn death of overdose to the creation of the domestic and biological food brand.
All gifts to a country where it is very expensive to go beyond a suicide food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man was not dead, it was over a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, a prestigious director with Oscar, said working with Newman was nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, has been gambling to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for justice and having a serious and distant private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try us, and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful even though he certainly did not miss the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" she used to scream.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, none of them was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a rebellious grandfather and a passionate philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or after the Olympics will take place in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'll say no!
They called it the "perfect course", but in my opinion it was the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of shocks, which were then taken into account in the evaluation and I was going to have to examine them, would be totally negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the withdrawal of the back, which was supposed to go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to take it all away (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go just to take the back (first foolishness, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' shirts (second madness, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it a crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, more than that, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the race started that we had not even deposited the bag, although, once it was successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened to wait more than 40 minutes, adding attempts to popular rebellion and assaulting the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct classification due to the chip that, I suppose, did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search recipient (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of recognition of human image and interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the audience into conversation groups.
In the video, for example, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week a lot has been talked about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial spraying, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change in direction is acceptable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing for your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time browsing online than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system's applications for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
There is a desperate need for it, in fact, and here I bring a small example.
I took the picture into this post in one of the recreation sites for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the machine of the drinks a folder prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees are using Google to do online research.
Last week, the rest, the delay was confirmed in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, unless it is even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying her to the Azzura Coast, Leonardo di Capri was in 'Diamante de blood' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay musculosa parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed buffs that raise the weights in the walking circle.
It is essentially the typical man-made shirt, with the inside of cotton, accentuated and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though the Belgian Fabulux Marcel lies above all.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive mood and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the magnet carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" is excellent compared to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic magnet models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tank".
It also includes hats for the college, boxer back, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailors, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimacies designed to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as a private laundry.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activities in the field of fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango company made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards than the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
He's hot and shy, he's winning you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we had invented for my sister Penelope and me for the autumn-winter season in Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are the elements of your new Mango collection for this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the 1950s and 1960s, from here we come up with various inspirations.
Then, I love losing myself in the city and watching women dress, as they combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Ballerina, actress and stylistic, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, even if at the end, everything is confused and there are many elements in common.
To me, as a child, they loved my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to enjoy my aunt's armpits and to see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once a ballerina, I've always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lessons and tips, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actresses, when you are given the watch is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionals.
Not long ago, you've been in crisis for 30 years.
But not.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years old.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience in absorbing life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she's asking me for my own body and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will give my son much happiness and educate him with great love.
With regard to the cinema, you are waiting for them to scan in the different rooms some filmed last year.
That's right, and I want them to go for a walk.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want you to eat "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you debuted on the passport with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in a hallway like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Donne for a better world" and the clothes we've been wearing – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – have been auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this delicate side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I have known her for a long time, I can confirm that I am not so true.
Moreover, I find myself with this good part in which she is involved.
He asked me to shoot for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pain, I would have done it the same way.
If it's to help third-world women, you can't get back.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will need to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents the driver from driving in a state of pregnancy or if he does not suffer in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor of the State, according to which it will be a pilot project for the duration of one year.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to take a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technical Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the car drivers reported more than once for driving in a state of gravity then again drive the car.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle measuring the rate of alcohol in the blown air and prevents driving if the driver does not suffer, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged to the penalty.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices would reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate their development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, no doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on the schools' buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 5.40 p.m., the Spanish aircraft in which Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez City Airport in Mexico.
The sun was crossing, but the rays still forced to use the hand as a sight to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a cab driver, along the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalise an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that moment...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the Asturias principles and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport on the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Marine soldiers offering the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they reported that in Mexico City she was threatening a bad time.
They give the photos a smile and a brief pause before going to the room where the official comedy awaits them.
At the door of the hotel in which they live, one of the four largest in the city, a spiritual reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and good-living Valentine.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to promote the international promotion of new talent in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched his drawings in Mango's glass at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second large-scale company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the stylish Valentino who presided over the competition jury, started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the close proximity of Chagal's most exquisite teles, the Presidential table of gala prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with a heart broken and making a need for virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH complements to remove the fiat and the arm of the son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the chairman of the lunch dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the house honors and to the knight who finished, along with Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because they both had given it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – turned into dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for the ballet sages and her, remembering other times, she grabbed a bar and picked up a "great floor".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us the photos of his son on the cell phone before.
The following day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved on - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his linens, his towels, and had been insured in the past, who did not smell us in his room.
Star under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if this wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30th.
The Awakening is almost a punishment when it squeezes every morning at 7:00 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the brake rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhausting and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number goes up to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of choice for each taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks it is impossible to gain peace in areas such as work or in personal relations, this 'manual' is a lie.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not run out in your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk to your sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak are still asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a scare, but it doesn't really matter very much.
This is a benign change in the defined sleepiness.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have told me that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing anymore.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes episodes are linked to other sleep disorders such as incubation, night fear, night enuresis (to make the pipe to bed), or sleepbullism, but not necessarily so.
As noted above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is not yet studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (urla, shouting, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you should observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check whether there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, on the other hand, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Offer quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after it will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you're interrupting his sleep.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and then she's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where it leads to such a great anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleepy and therefore not conscious to organize your mind.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but do not see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that these might lead to.
Never tell the child that you can ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like that causes enormous anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the road of victory in the house after a long fructuous period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-ners have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming it one in the game's victory.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting, in which the attackers expressed themselves tired.
After a first attempt by the captain of Kaufmann's host team who blew the seven with one shot away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the Dannemarie's defense, Fonderflick away, then Hirn high, Romain high and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the field, leaving only the Riahi shooting at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusern, well-positioned, took up a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Cannoner of Illhaeusern will not be able to absorb his happiness for a long time and will be released a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, sent just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocking action, the ball blew the cross.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in the hills
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a step in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who have brutally prevented access to various British and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to charm the representatives.
These have promised to accept it "with constructive spirit" and hope that "they are present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee", created by British fishermen in order to take action to address the fuel price imprecisely, which has reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure working conditions and the remuneration of the marines".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand by.
On Tuesday morning, they led the "lucky operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the marines have already proved their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the gates of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the mill, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at Loira Atlantica, interrupted the closure of Donges's total refinery note in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The shoe will continue" because "fishers will not surrender" et "they do not intend to move to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on oil, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the performance limit of a vessel is only reached with a fuel of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes still welcomed the legend of the film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008

Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely placed in the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 places.
So far, Embraer has delivered in eight years 41 flights to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group's insurance company, established by the US monetary authorities, would allocate more than 15% of its activities to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of a large part of its activities, in addition to the transfer of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, it states the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to assign include the International Lease Financial Corp., its share equal to 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision on such transfers has been taken, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessional by the Federal Reserve, at the expense of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: chronistry Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic holocaust on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a loss ever seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is finished at 10,365,45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684,81 points) above that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchange following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199,61 points closing at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing at 1,106,55, at the final closing figures.
Demobilized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is deep after the sudden rejection of the bank's rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates what the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, who was responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And stressing still the state of emergency," every day that leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegga stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the city group rival.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, calling for urgent action in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in a global crisis", added the financial analyst of FTN.
The compulsory market has gone up strongly.
The 10-year-old treasury profits are returned to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday night, while the 30-year-old is 4,161%, against 4,357% of the previous day.
Obama benefits from the first television dulo
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign have proclaimed their victory for television, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although worthy, was not bright enough to allow him to slow down in five weeks' polls by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published on Saturday, gives a five-point advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
A great performance by his partner, Joe Biden, who waited for the first and only debated with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"It would be a mistake to value it.
He's got a good insight," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventeen McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the adversary regarding the arguments raised during the first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.. he has often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president," he said.
What is a continuing target for the Republican television campaign yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved to be concrete and precise.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, contrary to Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproaching the Republic for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the nineties of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rainstorm, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "media class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most appropriate person to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could represent a decisive move," the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's intimacies in economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current strike "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reducing the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's results, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates raised their questions on the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still pending, many young people had come to express themselves against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "What for? They will do what they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a beautiful figure for external observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic step.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the roll-off of the votes," said Jouri Potemkine, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a face-to-face change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidents and chief of the pro-European movement, because the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can include a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union needs to start.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the election.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one at the polling station.
And there will be at least five members of the opposition to Parliament, the most appropriate to power."
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased with their success.
Meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he has regained the confidence of the public, seriously removed from the scandal of the blood infection between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which sought to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying a relationship, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canada Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, 38% of the people said that they still had confidence in the system of donations in Quebec, Dr. Decary recalled.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collection and field research over the years, we have regained public confidence," he said before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's morbidity, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélinau's reports, according to which when you have doubts and could get a serious disease, in this case the morgue of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, is taken of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was rejected from 1980.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without a doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for HIV identification appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests (TANs) that enable donors to directly recognise the presence of the virus in the blood and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. since the person contracted the disease to what the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to detect them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have led to a significant reduction in the risk of anti-AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving blood infected by the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, there will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV has been transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by an insect.
It must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr.Sa Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient resources.
"The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Being the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a contribution of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors that on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy persons who have attained 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
"With this 3% we can keep an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of misery are very rare.
But the members of this group of donors need to be renewed as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to hold them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frenetic that you find it difficult to give blood an hour," said desolating Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball valves, and skin that are used almost exclusively for severe rashes.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of the lumbar cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbelic cord, which once was considered a biomedical scar, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousand blood sample of cordon and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
You should begin to propose them for the trappings at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking blood from cordons as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that you cannot have access," because Hema-Québec does not have the means necessary to propose this complex and costly program in all Québec hospitals.
Calcium - The Impact in Semifinals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinal of the series A eliminations, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the final quarters, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central champion Antonio Ribeiro, marked the final goal at 90'.
After a first time without goals from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino signed up the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the return trip on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Decision-making network of Kovalev
The Canadians and their axes are ready to resume the season.
The trio format by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostsyn animated the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and collected a passage for victory in the fourth of the Ha's preparatory games.
Determined for victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, has warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to strangle in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of the elections before the end of the year.
Finally, Jean Charest made his way to Jean-Talon yesterday in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc, (left) tried to get elected during the partial elections today.
"Enlarging the borders of our last large northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments of the strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mulin with images".
On three maxi screens, negative hydroelectric digs, mineral cultivations, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of autumn elections, even though he noted that he was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on manpower, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the north- northern territory to the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North would be "a joy from the immense potential", but he did not speak about timing or investment quotas, as he did not explain the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
More and more, it has been limited to point out what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which has experienced various improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on the list styled by Charest, the North contains" nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory the double of France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he's insistent on us," he insisted, as he wants to encourage a mythical national founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the Fever of Gold in Abitib, the National Engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map on his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In other words, considering climate change, the North needs to be reassessed," he said as he spoke of the North-West crossing, which will be opened all year round because of the split of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.”
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourau (former member of the Hungarian PQ), have already given way to consultation of a thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) has taken on an important role, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would attract the rest of us to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This has also been one of the themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Burassa, Creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, it was used to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Road to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project concerning the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stated that its deployment would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, causing them to hear applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would have been no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not fail to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very committed, in particular in a mission of the federal council in China and at the summit of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief of Staff with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed loose like oil: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will be appointed by the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as opposition is concerned, the goal of the Northern Plan has been adopted in a sceptical manner.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, resuspended the Northern Development Policy of Quebec launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, we would have made progress today" said Marois next to the candidate of the Jean-Tallon (student today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, back today by the holidays.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Ironia of the Kind) of Harper Cabinet, to allow himself to say, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "comfort" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager when the charges were brought.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and lets a child-soldier march under inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Order, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraf's return so that it can be submitted to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of overcrowding.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", saying that Harper does not stop coughing and that it sounds so insanity on his lips.
Here we come at a time when there is no more morals: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today's minority (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party preaching Virtu, respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It is here that she is ashamed, Mr Toews, to give up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinions - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the largest aurifera company in the world has sported a shell for defamation from six million against three authors and a small square publishing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a desire for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who would support a position contrary to his own.
The outcome of the trial, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Black should spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decisively learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the bottom of the mining company.
In addition, in these armed struggles, tactics are often used to break the agreed rule in order to impose a consensus regulation which imposes the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who has to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that he should have presented his own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates are usually held in Canada with the exchange of views and not with manganese.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a genuine debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to be too confident in public opinion and misappropriately rejects requests and letters to support the authors of Canada Black.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate" when his contempt for the same public is obvious?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word only indicates those lawyers who are perfumedly paid and not all of the Canadians; this is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the negotiators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does so first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchange of views, and not in the view of what many see as a sort of packaging (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero a ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Apart from Garver's surreal speech, sports by Barack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, essential in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss arguments with the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is the end of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit abusive desires.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the Congress's chief executives, representatives of the republican and democratic regime, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saving-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been burning on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: check on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses purchased for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of payments paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the House of Representatives, the treaty table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day trial marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to protect the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unestimated discomforts and disturbances would have turned on the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the Treaties was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed deadline corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Following the treaty, the two candidates to the US presidency proved rather favourable to the agreement, but without avoiding expressing their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will enable the owners to maintain their home and that inherent to the payments to the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the inresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to reclaim the taxpayers' money with questionable credits, risk assets and ingenuity assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan arrives after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgage credit at risk (mutui) and then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (CCAA) and to focus on the freezing of liquidity and the disbursement of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of airing the first draft agreement last week.
It seems to be out of that blind alley since the Democrats have agreed that the "tossic" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision was added that if the government had to face losses during the five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the President responses it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will receive shareholdings in protected companies that will receive dividends in case of profit and that will be able to sell when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the valuation procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and benefits of the start paid to the directors of the undertakings involved.
From today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the free course will be given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the republican and democratic level.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to take it" he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas learned that it would have given up its competitors, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the risk-risk mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the largest twenty banks in Europe and the largest ten insurers.
"It's not the money lost, the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
On the other hand, there is a risk of influence and right to vote in banking matters.
It's certainly something that the rescuers and the families now appreciate that the times are uncertain"
During this period, at the other end of Manica, the British government seems to nationalize another bank in a bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge the total loans currently in progress at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time its axis in the sleeve, for others its weak point.
Did you get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the amateur smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devoted to true and sacred monsters.
What a waste!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut race, after a lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years to come.
Less monumental of Brando, which he resembled and of which he was along a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, by a Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last quality brand.
Because in him was a whole country recognized by the safe made man, by the war fighter of the Pacific, proud in the fighting, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and soon at the cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the driver who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as six symbols, although part of a couple model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadow zones of a reserved star, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heartstorm for filmmakers, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and the boy unable to wish the focus wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The cat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the hands of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he had promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgivable in Lassú someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and taken back after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
A bitter and profitable billiard player in the Lo Spacone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), the color of Martin Scorsese's money, which he earned in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face over the years, it was his.
Even him.
The times happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movement Slap Shot-Colpo dry by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on low-orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as father of the Irish mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most legendary levels of the film that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay long in the halls, denouncing Hollywood in all its fun, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging you to exaggerate your performance.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall as a manne from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of marginality to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunk charons or desperate ones, of whom he expressed dismay and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown shades of his true, sensitivities.
The first time that Jennifer, of 1968 (based on the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the role of the protagonist, was drawing a subtle female portrait of melanchonia.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes spent yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they had read together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
In addition to a career of legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood-based protestor.
We'll have strangled her face on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her with a choice of bad taste, though born as gag.
However, the proceeds of those sales were destined for his Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting to his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter that he said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Try it, it was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of an American artist so clean and generous.
I was a model citizen, so much more.
What was produced in Zuschlag & partners' invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the investigation, the money obtained from competitive bands was used for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, has ended in part in the funds of the Fiatal Balldal organization, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never complied with the obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
In order to do so, the invoices were purchased on the Jozsefváros market, but the circular stamps were manufactured in Kisunhalas.
And in order to decide on the name of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of these, then the invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among others those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are works by István Lados and András ̈ri which, according to our information, has drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of Lados's "travel studies" choices was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, wouldn't all come in together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jöv‐ért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is a pulse of formal errors and content.
One Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay, but there were 130 guests in the bill.
But the collectors of the invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with restaurant, in which accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - was not even included in the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv ért and Hoppá.
The company's administrator said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned to search and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that this was false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons he did not return even the fact that according to the bill, hundreds of people were accommodated, when they had eleven rooms in total and there are not so many beds.
By the time the invoice came, it was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The tax collectors were not concerned to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only abroad travels, so they were shockingly pointing out about the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's billing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, Iva was also included in the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt Iva.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong about the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Job Jöv‐ért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, as well as the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "issuers" failed other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as the activity carried out by the transport of goods on the road, as is known from the investigation procedure, activities which were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - the cause of invoicing in conformity, false stamp - it has been found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is why the liquidator of the company, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They issued invoices consciously
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, has persuaded the director of the Colllab Kft. to issue invoices.
He has collaborated with Zuschlag and also with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million flowers at the Job Jöv×ért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenny-Egyesület Association, after which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the invoices were then broken down, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their documents.
In the following group of taxable persons belong to those who are related to the defendants.
E.g. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to rescue the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, with headquarters in Budapest but not accessible there, which deals with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of computer tools, for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunhalas has purchased these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian who would have updated the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, has acknowledged that he has issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the controvalor was taken from him.
On the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian wallors founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos- Investment Bt.
However, in fact none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
The companies are however useful because, at the request of the co-rapporteur, Advocate Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generácio.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various institutions 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The search considers that Kubatov has invested 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue invoices made for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generácio and Sövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a band for the socialist party's public utility agency, Táncsics Mihaly Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 head-of-head flowers, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the Office of Arpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already been looking for, will probably refer to the progress in the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the taxed number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised several times to talk about everything in a broad way, he has not yet done so.
It should also be noted whether it is in his interest that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a 50 million flowerings, much of the damage - would be willing to do the spying chaper.
Zuschlag could also have been offended by the fact that his requests for relief from his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrests, have not yet been answered.
While the authors of non-reciprocable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which has not been granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bid: why spend more money?
The buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "lot" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axes.
One group of volunteers played the game, the other group of players participated in an auction, while the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of auction, where the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex becomes intensively functioning when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in the price is explained by scanning the actual reaction of the broken body.
In support of their theory, the research group economists conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product concerned and made their point.
In addition to this, another group have promised that in the event of a win, they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the gain was underlined, while for the other the loss.
Testing the hypothesis of neurologists, the group members who played "against loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "wine".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that are likely to be at stake with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation" - said Andrew Scotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should you contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary among the first causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients goes up to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The liver definition is the collective name of the infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and itteracy, but their pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, salt).
For those travelling, vaccination against the A and B virus is useful, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After forming yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two or three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, causing liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person in ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not cured it may cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumours.
Most of the infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens destroy the liver cells in a subtle way, in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Because also a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth addressing the doctor of the family when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so it stops the infectious power and can prevent tumor formation.
On September 30, it is the world's day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis, its causes for development and early recognition of disease.
Who believes in God feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the context of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed to 12 Catholic believers and other atheists, while all who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling the pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place just like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermellino by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious status among the believers, while the Leonardo framework was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a soothing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this aro of time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on the religious theme or the other.
The Catholics reported that the virgin Mary's vision made them feel "sure", as if "someone would take care of them" and "they were calmed and were overcome by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image, they accounted for 12% in less pain than when they had before themselves Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any powerful effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they feed very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains, if the believers are presented the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber, what effect could it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in heaven above their tests; you know where they spent their holidays, which outpatients attend and what interests them.
But this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian incubation do not actually see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that was: "Let's put all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google’s director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still in the beginning to be able to manage all the information.
Asking what would happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like to know if Google could answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the work that I would do?", but the software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all netizens are aware that the exact words they are looking for are recorded during their online research, the IP address they are looking for, and the page they are interested in after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked on, and then long to go they will generate results to a much better extent; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our stated and previously registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I care about? - concerned users are asked about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, netizens' counter-reactions are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the entity, and not by the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or even for the rebellion of power.
However, one fact is confirmed, and that all the sought expressions are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be provided to third parties, in such cases there is nothing to defend the personal rights of the netizens.
The most outstanding example of this in recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify the pedophiles from the website of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
The netizens concerned about personal rights instead were awakened in May when the firm - in agreement with the EFF's electronic legal protection association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even then, you cannot force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information specifically requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully broken almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords for two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are spreading Google because they believe that this is how their intimate sphere is touched and private life begins to use the services and rise with the revolt of the multinationals who boast of the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the winner of the world because of Windows, because they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for an identification code, it does not ask for money for its services, the source code that has always been updated and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool of the official software loop practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal and internet rights, which implies one of the key words most frequently repeated in recent years, web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 speaks of nothing but collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and to use the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your music tastes, all of these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs about which automatically appear your most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read a number of examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common group of friends, comes to know easily who spent the night with her faithful boyfriend or a company can fire a employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show whether they are themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but that at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
Not few people who do not register on community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from the preparation of texts to image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public opinion does not even expect so much in secret the time when Google will take out the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth more than IBM $140 billion, Intel $124 billion or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the entrances of advertising agencies, and the services introduced in record-time cause major ills not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, critical observers in addition to all of this find alarming points: for example, the corporate summit rejected the employee protest completely after it doubled the corporate asylum law, considered it too costly to repeat the daily restaurant to the satisfaction of the employees, all of which, however, undermined the fact that in 2006 Google has been the leader of the Chinese government and under their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world into a point: while some believe that the Google Book and Archive project will take on proportions such that the company will soon be faced with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the story of the famous Cory Doctorow's Scroogside describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google's data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped ozd's double murder make the tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd, suspected of having helped to eliminate the traces of the crime - said the spokesperson of the Police Question in the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the crime of being accused, they are currently being accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on their own foot.
The favor is punishable until 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man from the scene, was put in custody on Sunday.
It is suspected of premeditated multi-micide for profit.
The survey showed that the 20th-century young man had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off the debt, so on Wednesday, he pulled his creditor with a spell in an Ozd yard where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock list.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Polish despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in hand to the Polish state which intends to sell around a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far they have presented an offer to the Borsa di Vienna, the Transatlantic Borsa Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the Borsa di London and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank of Česká Sporijtelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments on the international economic crisis are already "one second September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American president - the accused La Repubblica - who has not been able to match his party behind a law quickly abolished, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as said billionaire Warren Buffett, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11th.
Another part of Madrid's press in Washington sees the spy chaper.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has put the world economy on the edge of the economy.
More and more the danger of the collapse of the American financial system and of this will then be felt by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress' vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to pass the threat - emphasizes the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some countries today can still offer a life jacket to the Barcolling Financial Institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect, then neither the financial resources nor new solutions will be sufficient.
In the long run, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the financial markets that have been set aside.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which seems to be more and more realistic the anxieties that European taxpayers, like those in the US, will have to put their own portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has come through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" must not immediately dissipate the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they were to establish in which case the taxpayer's money should be touched to prevent further damage.
The Smart Machine Imitates the Calabron Flight
What might be the best way to develop anti-choice technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan the calabrons gave the initial strategic phrase to engineers Nissan on how to build the next generation of anticollition systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a tiny robotized supply of the properties of the bees, with the aim of creating a system capable of scanning all the collisions.
By flying the bees form their own oval personal space that looks really much like our protective shield - he explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
The role of the ape view, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction, is important.
Engineers have approached the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the monkey, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This approach of avoidance, unlike the current system, is carried out in an entirely instinctive way.
"If not, the robot car would not react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what ape does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrow.
But unlike the bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of steering.
In this way, instead of endless opportunities for bees to scan other bees, the robot, as possible available, can wheel on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymers, lighter and high energy density, which means that their duration exceeds those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data, or even less the ability to store it is important.
This robot must produce some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few dozens of Kb.
You don't need a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further application options can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoids the obstacles present on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child
The written version of the saving law was drawn up of $700 billion for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new protracted agreements until mid-Saturday, according to the time of the eastern coast, congress leaders decided the saving plan of $700 billion after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken a series of steps ahead - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Representatives, who only remained to put the deal on paper.
Both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of Treasure Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at the 8th hour of Washington (the 2nd of the night of Monday according to the hour of Central Europe), but it did not result in a major increase in the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilization law of 2008 concerning the programme, after which it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and welcomed the news of the agreement with the White House with joy.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to defend the economy - said Tony Frato spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with loans disproportionate to the back.
As a first step, you will be able to spend up to half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Congress vote on Monday, with these Treasury Ministers will purchase securities with disproportionate loans, of the kind of the remaining 100 billion dollars will be decided by the President.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve is also taking part.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credit, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "accelerated" credit.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the departmental authorities.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury ensures the means of concern for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the means necessary for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The managers of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the extra-ocean slang simply as gold parachutes.
The limitations of payments will only take place in some cases, and the limitations will depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will provide assistance.
In substance, the limitation means that if the ministry buys within an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, if they do not send the late bank manager back to retirement.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not excessive.
It must be added that the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal restriction on the remuneration of the general administrators - said democratic Barney Frank, president of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to make an appropriate allowance for a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can also make a profit if the economy, and together with it the saved bank, will be restored.
The legislative proposal includes that in the next five years, the President must present to Congress a proposal that provides for the return of the planned losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
Of course, both parties have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend the taxpayer's dollar - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague, Ohio Mary Kaptur, believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for Wall Street's collapse.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - informs the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
The export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, but the previous year decreased by 3.9%.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of national industrial sales related to the previous month only increased by 0.1%.
National sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The higher prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), mainly the bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemical and product sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machines (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3% in August in industrial national sales, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the national sales of the manufacturing industry, the higher increases in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metals, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in food, drink and tobacco production, representing a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the fields of the production of electrical instruments and machines (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Overall in the manufacturing industry over the year prices rose by 10.2%.
The prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7% last year.
In national sales among target groups in the sectors, the increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices grew by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sectors, prices did not change compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the higher prices were observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, a decrease of 1.4% was measured for investment goods.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in flowers increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to the 12 months, by 3.9%.
The Hungarian flora around a month fell below the euro of 1.7%, compared with the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a vision?
King Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the extraocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that the new system will no longer be allowed to enter, but before departure the tourists will have to register.
The Head of the Hungarian Diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order of the Republic of Hungary with the Star and will engage with the foreign policy consultants of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Also Barack Obama and John McCain went to support the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday at the government plan of $700 billion for bank rescue, but there are politicians claiming the resignations of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration after the long-lasting marathon negotiations announced on Sunday night that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank's rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more appropriate than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the introduction of the economic issues Obama has regained some advantage again, while McCain's advantage, which was obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment as Vice-President of Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps that were supported by him too.
"When we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not let himself be over-defined by McCain's economic ideas.
McCain, in an interview with the ABC, explained that "all those who will send down with difficulty this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role to play in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print description of the German language world
The right pole is intact, only within the pole the electors have become more aware - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (speckle.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German left magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU has begun a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple got in charge.
The Christian-socials have refurbished Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens withdraw from them.
At the same time, the change of time is a problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that was just ten years ago feasible: it ended the indisputable egemonia of a state-state party.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated at 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold from the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago to the elections of the Bundestag in 2005 still in the period mentioned in the so-called Stoiber.
This is the reason why modernization has been carried out in the region, which feeds on parents.
The sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a long mistake. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and the North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not be left without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernization is a step in the process of increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only within the pole the electors have become more self-conscious, critical, stunned.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks CSU has removed the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates.
Here CSU support has dropped below 40%.
The Presse (depresse.com)
The Romanian daily Conservative "Who with whom?" In the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with the OVP.
The OEPS prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now everything around the coalition is rolling; in the discussion broadcast by public TV party leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the OVP, as vice-canceller.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has responded cautiously to red offerings.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of the OVP.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, questions must be discussed in any case within the OVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated his opening in all directions.
"In order to prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing" - said Haider.
Járóka: The visual circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, organised this year by France with the European Union's rotating presidency.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and thus the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organisations and the defence of rights within the framework of equal opportunities.
Mr Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE Group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the occupations, that the Roma are exorbitant from the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most Roma young people do not have a medium-level study title and as a result of elementary quality teaching only an unrestrained number of them can reach a higher study title."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the enjoyment of human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more widely known between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, as soon as the school starts a Roma, its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market are increased; income and consumption taxes contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's objective and action is necessary to speed up the process of school disengagement and therefore it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The visible circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, and Roma children must be given the opportunities granted from the democratic space in order to contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the Berlin meeting last year, is to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
By the end of October, you will decide the sort of packed couple Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the serious electoral failure, the trial of the Bavarian CSU has not yet been carried out, the discussion of personal matters has now been postponed.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is until when mercy lasts.
The kind of tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two very critical politicians have made it known in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the headquarters.
They have thus tried to soften the angry entrants of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the Bavarian tsunamis have claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, then at the end of his career, the Christian-social union got 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber, 43.4% fell.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservationists in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will always be forced to slow down in the future.
As the first sign of the reorganisation within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, has obtained a place in the restricted exploration group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right values for any government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Liberi electors enter the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber was exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman in no respect from the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role to play in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to cancel after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU has played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the delusion for the beam, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social-democratic crisis will still last.
The SPD has reached its lowest score since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
A representative of the opposition did not enter the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is explained by the votes cast.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition, under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS), hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with the renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections in the circumstances under discussion, would have allowed some seats in Parliament to represent the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up on a boycotting previously evaluated.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and has agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines across the country through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
It referred to a distance that the OSCE, assessing the electoral campaign, put emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on the submission of a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's fast report on Monday also criticised the campaign, during which the candidates for the opposition could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote.
Despite this opposition it is perceived to be an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on the paper, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps ahead and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said in our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential candidate for the opposition to the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains that "the power was afraid of even one opponent entering a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide protests for the results, but rather tries to get voters to get the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities are making difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support the change, even among the elders, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially more helpful fund, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate, which considers its main result to the creation of social security.
Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security "remembers the grave silence" - Considers Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers have judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Independent Community, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but the proof of maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But today he takes this new measure against the furbets, against those who stamp, and then he's going to drink a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" says the Minister.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no resistance on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "There was a process shared by workers and there was the collaboration of all."
I mean, nothing more breakfast in working hours; nothing more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
In the course of a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the public employees' disease agencies have reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand people in more than one year to work".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees joined in protesting the rules of Decree Brunetta, acceding to the application supported by Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service is dropping numbers today about the least absenteeism at work because of illness - writes consumer association - the people of the 'operating workers' are growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war to the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for disease dependent on service; the extension of the hourly stages of reperitability of the sick worker, including the inspection visits, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crasial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 deaths at work, 3 deaths and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to homicides.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day in all provinces of Italy for victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data transmitted by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for Mutilated and Invalid Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "living appreciation for the constant association commitment to prevention at work, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, an angry 'abstain', sincerely shared, has been lifted in the face of tragedy that, for their size, provokes the slander of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality offers us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people who look at the world of work.
It is important to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to delay in the alarm on its social seriousness, to apply and improve legislation.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive commitment on all institutions to bring an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths, however impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "tender down" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention goes out that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has underlined Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It is a further effort - it has added - with regard to the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, it needs a more sense of responsibility from employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of protection provided for the victims of work" and the "assisting debt to which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are unhappy should not depend on spontaneousism or enlargement again and again laid down by the legislator."
Mp3 readers are accused, risking the hearing
Listen to high volume music for a longer period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, a communication published in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the United States, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - read in the note - emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day with the high volume device risking a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - continue the responsible Ue - there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is more, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and take a step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the executive Ue - confirm that there is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now consider, together with the Member States and interested parties, what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and fine equipment."
Currently, there is a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but raises concerns about the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue points out that users of portable musical equipment when listening to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force concerning the maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, it starts, in March it closes, in June it will take the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the terms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the combatants are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Campidoglio and its trade union Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it has to point out German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which political decision makers, who remain in the Joint and the Community Council, will then be able to avail themselves.
There is no overposition of roles but only the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, he will finish his work and then he will quit, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of worthlessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work that will be able to do the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics interferes with the management of the newspaper and with the events that are being repeated.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome has to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage zone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roma citizens a euro and will serve to rationalize and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For Germany, in fact, "there must be a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the present municipal borders but will look well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "even in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? First President Anti-American. That's why
He wrote an American political note that has to do with us independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
They increase the attacks against Obama as the date of the elections approaches.
He wrote a lady from Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big fat face: he thinks he will win the highest charge of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and do not answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Well, there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there's someone who talks to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the chamber to vote we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It emerges from a side of the United States mentality that has been covered up to the last.
"Tell us what you want, then we'll think about where to put the croquet, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama had to win, we'd leave America.
What has never been said before, which seems almost certain to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
He's changing America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home on foot.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make bail.
However, Iraq for the majority was the weak point of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic drag also makes you feel about journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many people blame the Internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the polled journalists, if you do not want traditional journalism, as the big public does.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today the U.S. journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive seniors are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The main publishing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many views like the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "make something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with the "security of work".
Executives who think they're losing their job around 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the reporter staff if it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning is complicated: every day after the first year, each day after the third to arrive at 15 complete days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROOM TRIBUNALS, DANILO COOPOLA LAST TO GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, decided to reject the claim of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola, who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Anti-Traffick investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl scale.
During the process at its charge, last week, he obtained the discharge from the housekeepers transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the province town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the Court, however, these movements (which he considered to be contrary to the pm) would allow him to influence his company and access to the evidence that he was accused of.
The elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms this yesterday by informing us that the current crisis is breaking down the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the sake of the matter, which was made by the majority alive with the vote I had said at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of the changes, of the major changes, that the current economic climate may be pre-announced or already let go: not only in the United States but throughout the West, but perhaps even here.
Both in use and in Europe the crisis seems to be functioning as an incubator of phenomena incubation from time to time, and in the new climate, they are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the double category of state-supervised in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have been linked to the outside world, but first of all, they see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also elected.
I mean the crisis appears economically global but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the European Union is given the light proof that it usually divides between the various interests and between the various state strategies is unable to decide on a common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and relaunching plans, new rules, and above all the money delivery: since when you get to the streets, it is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to get things back into the sixth place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of unremunerated value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organisation will ever have the like.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the country-state element is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the kingdom of the network, of the ever more sophisticated technology, of the material, while we were convinced that the globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have come to a conclusion that our future will have to make the accounts to an increasing extent with those very little material things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the ground, but they are absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, he certainly has many more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species, is so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discreditation, an intolerance, an image of inadequateness, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of leaders in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be becoming more and more road, in large areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far increasing, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, i.e., feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegation of the leading classes and traditional political essays, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolving" electoral or sudden events of the collective moods of these last and final times, from the conservative escalation in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the Labour Consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say to someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, potentially acts to disparate.
In the face of all this, it would be exaggeration to say that a "mass revolution" on the agenda would be over-excessive.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The superclip to walk on the walls
To defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and in the future to walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With only 2.5 centimeters square, the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the study team is an evolution of existing ones using a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure a perfect animal adherence.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these rectangles and at the same time "gets away easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and power.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For the time being, there's no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – Even the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to searching for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive made of microfibre as hair that self-pulls from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to pumping juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially during the summer, are consumed because desiccants and vitamins, if they are taken at the same time to some life-saving medicines, they alter absorption by amplifying or reducing, as appropriate, the effectiveness with even serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices are packed and fresh associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: enough a glass of pumping juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some save drugs, canceling the benefits and endangering the health of patients.
The pump juice was already finished under charge because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, ansiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals up to the toxic levels.
PHARMACIA A RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicines Agency had given this information in a two-year newsletter warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to take care of what you drink if you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, the orange juice and the apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by pumping and other sugars.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are reported in general immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that eventually provide for changes in the pharmaceutical information notes.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask for clarifications to your doctor or pharmacist."
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, when Enron fell, Krugman planned in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that came not only from a few polemics and that for years it had been remedied to the economist, but that now it has proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the Enron or Worldcom collapse has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economicist of great value", but also a disclosure with a "very aggressive" style, particularly critical against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteers, whose back watches SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with different innovations: to the welcome screen and to the magazine interface and made less scattered, if they add other more substantives such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also given to interoperability with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific features of some modules such as that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphic processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "hard PDF" documents, which combine the typical graph of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene more handy among different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the editor of texts, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English one on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the CD installation can also be sent to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a training for dissemination in the homes, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already able to count on various projects made in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of reality that offers an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Emulsion Presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the planned figure can also be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third graded and winner of the best climber shirt.
Bringing the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26enne Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to the Cera, the third generation era, after the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positive in Cera, Austria will lose third place in the Tour and will meet two years of canonical qualifications.
To confirm Kohl's positive news at the third generation era is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian took place on the final podium at the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also awarded himself the shirt to a better climber.
IMMIGRATE: NEW YORK TIMES AND OTHERS, IS IT RELATED?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with determination.
This is turning Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what a long article the New York Times has been asking for that long article to be devoted to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Lega which restricts the restrictions on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is also cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
The trend has been highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in the Quirinale has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Victims of rent up to 900 euro per room
The rental market for universities does not know any crises.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the rent union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very seriously the point of excluding the whole range of young people from the right to study for the most complex costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market to introduce a process of generalised increase for residents."
In most cases, rental offers include a number of violations: free, unregistered, canon-free, connected sub-rents.
In Sweden, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax rate, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a place in the Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bedside cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they spend 250/280 euros for a place in a double bed, from 370 to 500 per single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a place bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
It only saves you if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, for a bed place, EUR 300/450 is required, for a room is spent from EUR 400 to 600, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed place, 250/350 euros, at least 350 per single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents are more frequent in extra-Community students, such as Perugia, there is at last a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historical halls
Historical cinematographic halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographed effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the city of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multisals and the consequent death of monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inexhaustible and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory," it is as if less a friend, a knower with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions," observes the director of New Paradise cinema, the film that twenty years ago in Tornado the Oscar Prize and the Great Prize of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the practitioners, speak clearly: in the last five years, the battlers have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and paying the largest discount are the rooms in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most hit by the closures, Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anek, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to talk about the lack of funding in favour of the workers, the state's debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year'.
Interestingly, Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with closures, has decided to run to repair with the signature of a protocol between Commune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and on the periphery.
There are tax relief measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking.
"It's an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter multiplex corruption, traditional halls also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking of for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of the National Way now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the dust-stained cartels around me from the other side."
Leagues between politics and arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonise the choices of the Commune to the interests of the piromelli cosca."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Antimony Directorate of Calabria refer to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torreone and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for an external competition in mafias association.
In mannets too Joacchino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer's nephew, the boss's homonymous, already convicted for association to criminalize mafiso stamps, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"In spite of any legal and moral standard, as well as good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been so granted to the blind - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the possibility, already large, of controlling and directing public administration."
The president of the Calabrese regional joint Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local and malavit are many" in his region: "These are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusation is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'andrangette', heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests follow those last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli cosca.
At the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians were called upon to administer the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, Udc's mayor at the time of the dissolution, was elected to the head of a central right coalition, after the May 2006 coup.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of architecting everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the nightmare Piromelli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrene, they write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group of acquaintances near the Pyromals, harmonizing the public administration's choices in the interests of the cosmos".
When energy comes from the waves now they go down in the fields of big
It is a long-term garden, which employs more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's large energy companies.
Where, currents, seas are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands like the Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for hundreds of years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalists and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea-based motorcycle exploitation facilities.
This amount would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And more would be the currents and the seas.
Colossus to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, who signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to bet on marine energy are increasingly and among these companies are always voted on to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he has declared the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil strike at the Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining permission from the United States Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that, in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new vibrations.
In addition to Chevron there is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as not noted in the details, indicate an interest in excess according to observers.
Technology to set up.
Experts speak of a technology still in the trees, even because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about environmental impact.
For now, plants like that Portuguese or some in Scotland are small sizes and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system connected to each other.
The pressure of the waves, which moves the oxen up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the gallbladders.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the river through underwater cables.
For now there are four such installations in the way of design, waiting for only federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are the seas makes the turbines turn around, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or waves and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It's just about the energy of the seas that were like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that look at the costs, they already invested $7 million in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
