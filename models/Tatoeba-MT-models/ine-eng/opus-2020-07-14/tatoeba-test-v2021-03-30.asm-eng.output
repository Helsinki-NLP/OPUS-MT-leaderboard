What news?
Looking for Tom and Mary.
I'm in the middle of a fight.

Why are you here?
Carnival doesn't respect limit.
Tom's got a tricycle now.

That is why I have accepted the sacrifice.
That's why I'm sad.
Sure.
Of course.
I'll hurt you.
I'm not embellished about this.
Again, Coason.
That's why I took the sacrifice.
In 1957, the Soviet Union sent a young pig named Lyca to heaven.
Have you ever seen her?
I'm just having one cup of coffee.
By no means!
I don't need any more work.
It's light.
Two qualities.
I need you to do it.
Congratulations, you have won.
Tom and Mary said.
So call me back.
Trying to move Thomas and Mary.
Physically.
The novel is now written in Romania.
Say it again.
Like my sweet water.

You have been invited to a message for one day.
I'll kiss you.
I'm just having one cup of coffee.
No, it's not.
I have to tell you.
How does the weather differ from that of the weather?

Are you all right?

Fill in that number by three.
That's why I'm pretty.
Looking for Tom and Mary.
I liked you.
No, he did not.
Have you ever seen him?
What's going on, Red?
Of course.
Where's your school?
Are you a good person?
Read!
She'll call back.
Keep your hands off me.
He'll call back.
We've been here for three years.
I've got a bullet from my brain.
I don't really like it.
What do you have?
Menad must have been desperate.
Where's your school?
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your hands off my feet.
Wait for the honeycomb, and for the honeycomb, and for the oil, and for the oil, and for the sweetness, and for the sweetness, and for the pleasantness of the smell.
You ever go to Rome?

I want you to do better.
1 Is It a Basic Number?
Set the number by three.
Tom and Marik.
I therefore accepted the offer.
Everyone has to die.
She had been browsing the Internet with her sister.
Shit!
I'll still hurt you.
When will the bad news end?
Where does Tom work?
Can I have a cigarette?

Keep your hands off me.
Set to true to be quiet when the time is low.
I'll kiss you.
Can you fix it for me?
Janie wanted to eat the shoes again at Caf√©.
We've been here for three years.
Again, Coason.
There was no time for anything else.
I can't believe it's complicated.
Two qualities.
Of course.
I finally received my national pension!
Tom's not in a good mess.
That's why I'm pretty.
I'm not embellished about this.
They wanted to help you every time.
Have you ever seen that?

Are you all right?
Like my sweet water.
Tom's not back yet.
That's why I'm sad.
Fill in that number by three.
It's raining.
He's got his own knife.
When will the bad news end?
What do you have?
That's why I took the sacrifice.
The door closes in the drawing.
The enemy's friend.

Keep your hands off my feet.
Tom's got a tricycle now.
I think I'll take it.
That's why I took the sacrifice.
Tom wasn't in the mood.
Have you ever seen him?
Tom, don't tell us the truth.
Not a doll.
No, it's not.
Of course.
Have you ever seen her?
Tom wasn't careful.
I'm just having a cup of coffee.
I like the language.
Are you all right?
Can I have a cigarette?
Not tonight.
Carnival doesn't respect limit.
You have been invited to a message for one day.
I'm talking to my friend.
I'll hurt you.
It's been a long time.
He's done his job.
I'll be all right.
Never return to the first place.
What's going on, Red?
No, it's not.
There's no rain in it.
She'll call back.
You're still happy to be alive.
Who has given you advice from the doctor?
Tom wasn't dependable.
Wait for the honeycomb, and for the honeycomb, and for the oil, and for the oil, and for the sweetness, and for the sweetness, and for the pleasantness of the smell.

It's possible murder.
I can handle it.
Tonni.
I really don't want to live in Australia.
They're trying to end Kayato.
Everyone must die.

I'm back!
I like it.
Of course.
I'll hurt you!
I therefore accepted the offer.
I'm holding hands and hands.
What's wrong now?
Where's your school?
It wasn't in the woods.
Is the time already running out?
I want you to do better.
Why didn't you stop talking?
Read!
Drag and drop this font to read.
This isn't bad.
I'm not choking about it.
Where's your school?
Pick up and drop squares and place them in the opposite order.
Dilate with the gitchini pasli with the brush.
Sure.
Keep your hands off my feet.
I'm doing what I promised.
Tom is the new computer.
No, he did not.
Keep your mouth shut.
You're not a bad kid.
Tom wasn't the first.
Tom doesn't do the same.
It's not bad either.
I want you to do better.
I have never seen such a thing.
You always have to read.
I really enjoy dancing.
I'll hurt you.
Swallow your teeth, mix them up with the pieces of your shirt, make them white, and then break them into pieces.
