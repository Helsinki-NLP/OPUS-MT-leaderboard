Named after the number of newly elected members of the Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-declared Lugan People's Republic (LNR) said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new voters to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is planning “to do something together”.
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian VPs, mass dismissals have led to a low capacity of units," Maročko, quoted as "RIA News".
He also did not rule out that real numbers of Ukrainians could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began a so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO) that was later changed to a joint force operation (OAS).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of the Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass had worsened as a result of the murder of the head of DND Alexander Zharchenko.
The DNA authorities qualified as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the division had organized Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British media compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, Jeremy Hunt, compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being a member of the Community.
A diplomat made such a statement at the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, which was opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not be diminished, it will only grow, and we will not be the only one who wants to escape the prison," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to order Britain to leave the EU would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.

Ilon Mask has to leave the post of Directors of Tesla's Board of Directors
The US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask have settled their dispute on fraud.
That's what CNBC News reports.
According to the tele canal, the position of the chief board of directors of Tesla will have to be left within the framework of the arrangements reached by Mask.
The Commission, however, allowed Moscow to retain the position of the chief of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay the administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be taken with Tesla.
In this way, money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who lists 50 richer people on the Forbes version of the magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX space company, Neurotechnological company Neuralink and the Tesla electrician developer, as well as the founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Stock Exchange Commission has previously brought to court the Director General of Tesla Ilon Maska for his statement on the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock in $420 was reported as "due to the importance of this figure in the marijuana culture", Bloomberg said earlier with reference to the co-director of the Security Division of the Commission, Stephen Peykin.
However, Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares.
Commenting on the claim made against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the charges of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and disappointed with these claims.
"Frequentness is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not broken it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective claim against Maska, complaining of financial losses.
The complainants claimed that the businessmen had lost them.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the businessmen had been misled by the tweets, which made it necessary for Tesla stock sellers to purchase paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the unwarranted statements of Ilon Maska led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of the Citron Research research company in stockbrokers.
However, if Mask could not settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with removal from company management and even prison.
In particular, CNBC's former Chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission stated.
Mask is a "bad guy who can't run a car company."

Tramp told me about "love" in Kim Chen Yin
From the mutual cruelty of the U.S. leaders and the Canadians, it's almost as if they're in love with each other, Donald Tramp.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, noted his success in the North Korean crisis resolution.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries now have so much to repair relations that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had adopted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barack Obama's team had so much to do with the DPRK that it could not even call the country's leadership - there simply had not taken the tube.
At that time, the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House "precious letters", Tramp said.
Tramp admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "suffering" to Kim Chen Inn, who was, by the way, mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that leaders “have fallen in love with one another”.
However, Tramp asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Tramp pointed to the recent cessation of the nuclear and missile tests and the closure of the military police.
All of this is the work of his administration, confident by the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Tramp approached Kim Chen Yin from the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to descale tension.
Tramp noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK will continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

However, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had already been sent to the CDR since the US Singapore Summit, but Phinean rejected them, calling them gangsters.

Nicay called for the use of "muscle language in Ukrainian"
The Ukrainian children ' s novelty and the struggle for the purity of the native language, Larisa Nice, called for the withdrawal of the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language from Ukraine.
To do so, she proposes Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
Nica shared with the Ukrainian edition "Observator" with her comments on "the objective of the elimination of the Russian language in Ukraine".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - even already exists and continues to develop.
In time, Ukrainians are “stirring up” from this “musk language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been widely used on television and radio before, but that it had not remained in public space.
However, in the view of Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: in its view, the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are only "the expansion of borders for the Ukrainian matter at the legislative level".
Nica used to share experiences of maintaining the Ukrainian language regime in a child camp in Karpatah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened the Watsons bookstore network, a cashier who had contacted her in Russian.
When he didn't get it, Nick turned into a gift girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to reject Russian letters even in writing their names.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger was not able to avoid even the Ukrainian Security Service: he was there, and he heard the conversation of the officers with each other in Russian, and she had made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.

"This complex game was won, a serious man conversation was interrupted, and it brought its fruits: two balls were killed and they didn't miss.
"You missed a couple of fighters because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did he feel today?"
"If he's been 90 minutes, that means it's all right!
Actually, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a little bit of power, nothing happened.
And yes, Dr. and Physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevic Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are so grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery is easier, and the mood in the community is good.
Now we had a white coat, though it was black at first.
We need to continue in the same spirit and rejoice with the sick."
"Have you tried the game since it didn't go out in the field?"
"It's been a little awkward, because, indeed, the unpleasant situation has gone away.
But I'll say again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and encouraged the sick.
And the rest is secondary."

During the Sunday referendum, citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum was called upon to settle a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece concerning the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincided with the name of the northern Greek region.

The indictment for the Dagestan MP has become news
The Soviet District Court of Machačla has detained a two-month member of the Dagestan National Assembly of Rajab Abdulatipov, who is suspected of participating in a criminal community that has established disability for recruitment.
"U" has become known details of the investigation materials that shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic of Ramazana Abdulatipo Rajab Abdulatipi has now contributed to the criminal activity of the former head of the Medical and Social Bureau of Magomed Mahachev and his associates.
Among other things, during the expeditious research activities carried out by IMF staff, it was found that Rajab Abdulatiputi lobbyed the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as the head of the bureau, as if he had received 70 million rubs.
It was recalled that a criminal case under article 210 (the establishment and participation of the criminal community) was initiated with regard to Magomed Mahacheva, other leaders and officials of the territorial health and social expertise offices under his command, and 290 (the acquisition by the organized group), 292 (the official basis) and 159 (the matrimoniality of a particularly large size) of the CSF.
As noted in the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatip, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his associates involved in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
In the position of the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service on Daguestan, and having contact with public authorities and law enforcement bodies, as well as in their family relations with the head of Daguestan, Rajab Abdulatip, the investigators considered that he had ensured the activities of other participants in the criminal community, had established contacts with officials of the public authorities to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and had him found at the head of the federal penal institution, “The Central Bureau of the Medical and Social Expert of the Republic of Daguestan”, had organized the illegal establishment of disability for citizens”.
Following the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatip rejected the charges brought to him.
"Of course, all that I'm accused of today is new to me, I'm not quite familiar with that," he said.
The Court arrested a member of the “One Russia” not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous senior D.C. officials, and immediately for two months, since he was a member of the D.C.R. 210.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much longer time to file charges - up to 45 days from the time of detention.

It is clear that the GHG is located in the territory of Kosovo, but it is related to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia another ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to acknowledge it.
Last spring, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually absent in a negative way.
The head of the Committee of the Federation International Affairs Council, Constantine Kosachev, considered the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and did not rule out that it would be able to return to the FF as an integral participant in addressing global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years to Russia has now been more inflamed," said the senator in an interview published in the Sunday "Russian newspaper".
He explained that in previous years the FF had been “described as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with Ebola, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which was sufficiently unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, he stressed Kosacev, “the topic of Russia was virtually missing in the negative key”.
"If I carefully analyse the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am now not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not exactly," said the politicians, noting that Russia was "no longer a wall trained by a tennis ball."
The head of the well-known committee, Sovfed, does not rule out that this suggests a trend which, in his view, “will be allocated to the current session [United Nations Genoa], although this trend may be fully reflected in a year or two or three”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point," said Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs with Russian integration."
For example, he led situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukraine crisis will also be called for in time," the MP added.
This is related to what he believes to be “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not simply an inalienable participant in addressing the global problems of modern times”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going to go somewhere where the movement will no longer be moving back, it'll be moving forward," he added.
In this context, another “interested and important sense” called Kosačev “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the Genoa Assembly] by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was delighted to see that, if two or five years ago, in a Russian opinion, a vision of the world, which was largely uninterested, the situation would be different," said the Chairman of the Soufeda Committee.
In his view, it was due to the fact that “there were no answers to the so-called new liberal order in the West, how to deal with world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in global space, how to deal with problems in the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration”.
"And here the demand for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident," said Kosačev, stressing that in this sense he views the current session as a "good session for the work of a Russian delegation that is successful for Russia".

In Damascus, they declared their right to use the military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not be forced to use military force, the head of the MIDI of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem, said.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to resolve quickly the problem of the removal of combatants banned in Russia by Jebhat An-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports the RIA News.
The head of the Middle Ages also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates in the event of the desire for segregation of Kurds.
At the same time, in the opinion of Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish forces of SDF were good until they were stopped because of the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the lines of armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Command.
Earlier it was reported that a 37-year-old defender had been negotiating a transition to the Moscow Spartak.

The first speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Geraštenko, apologized to the F.F.F. for "spinning" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suštenko for not being able to release him from prison so far.
She said this in a video to a police lock-in, written before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of the FSB.
She said that in those days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there was an action that was announced by the participants in a hungry protest demanding the release of the Kremlin aliens.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural actors, and people who know you are hungry, supporting Oleg Senzov, other policemen, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not require pressure on Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one requirement: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the police prisoners of Kremlin and those who illegally detain in the occupied territories of Donbass and Kremma," Geraštenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would call on each Ukrainian to make us “bader, more stringent in the protection of Ukraine’s national interests, in the protection of each Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil”.
The correspondent of Ukraine in France, Roman Sustenko, was detained by the Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at the Moscow airport.

On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sustenko to 12 years in a strict regime, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
The Russian prisoners met the last request of the Ukrainian before his colonization.
NASA reported approaching the Earth asteroid size with Big Ben

"I couldn't even hold the bed"
Wachtang Kikabide for Cancer Control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Illness, unfortunately, will spare no one, but the history of popular cancer victory gives hope to many sick people.
A famous Wachtang Kikabide actor admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I'm like a mole down on the skull.
I fell.
He's lost his focus.
Put them in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the bed there, I couldn't stand it, I fell all the time.
The tests started, it turns out, the artery doesn't shed blood.
They brought me to Moscow, where they said I had a big, ugly chest in my head, an emergency operation.
And during the operation of the oxygen doctors, they saw a tumor," Kikabide told me in the "Once."
Opuhol has become a criminal.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi’s inhabitants even came to say goodbye to a comedian on the threshold of his home.
But the actress’s wife did not allow the living actor to be kept alive, she believed she could cope with the illness, and she did not leave her beloved wife’s bed for more years.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Always when I had critical situations, she was close to the rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he rejects what is said about his illness, about the imminent end of the system of things.
The founders of the Mirotretz site introduced the section "Cleaning" by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Seyarto.
As a result, "the temptation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the Vice-Chair of the neighbouring countries highlighted “direct threats of invasion into Ukraine” and “support for separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as the “organization of a provocation aimed at the mass violation of Ukrainian citizens’ legislation”.
It should be noted that in front of Sierra Leone, the deputy of the Kyiv-Petchery Lavre Paul and the former Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) were approved by Onufri.
As a result, they were opposed to receiving Thomas from the Ukrainian State Church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, Ukrainian President Petr Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the sum of the Golden Parachutist's Warehouse.
At the same time, 23 salaries were paid to the Deputy Governor of the Iron Curtain, Yury Agibalov, under the Regional Law on State Posts.
In this case, the actual amount of gold parachute released from office was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations provided the regional government ' s press services.
Under the law, Agibalova's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, they stressed in the press service that the amount of the one-time payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, rather than 1 million rubles written by the media.
The officer has received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
His internship in the State office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and one-time payment is made immediately after the resignation, explained to the RIA News agency in the Government area.
At the same time, Agibalov's pension payments were suspended when he was appointed for maternity and his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The victorious governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, was elected to office on 15 September.
Agibalova was released from office as a result of the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the credentials of other officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram-Canal Nezigarh published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had resigned from the post of Vice-Governor, had paid an exit allowance of 23 salaries and, two days later, had again received a similar post without the addition of the “voio”.
A Member of the House called on the school to tell the school about the damage of masturbation
Onischenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents were causing the harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is done at the level of educational institutions and families, added by the deputy.
Gennadius Oništenko, MP of the FF (in the interview of the Moscow speaking radio station):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done by reason of the loss, because there is a risk of sexual health for both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that child rearing will take place early enough, and there is still a large gap between their sexual creation and the possibility of formal inter-polation.
In the opinion of Oništenko, the problem is prevented by “handling”, by reducing “the problem of sexual age” and by the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is convinced that many adolescents are exposed to laziness.
The deputy believes that the lessons to be learned about the harm of onysism are primarily in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just won't get along with you, easy talking," said the professor.
Gennadius Onischenko is an active academic of the RAMN, a member of the RAMN Bureau, a doctor of medical science, professor.
Dr. Russia and Kyrgyz, member of the Bureau of the Russian Public Health League of the Russian People's Organization.

AdG became second in popularity in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" is a regular record of popularity, and the ratings of Angel Merkel fall.
The Germans, on the whole, began to take a serious stand against the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which led to the country's leadership for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious is the recent question that the anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" party is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of Merkel and Zehofer ruling bloc are weakening.
This week, AdG was on a regular record, rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathy.
Right conservatives with 17 per cent of the population were able to embrace social democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but it could not be noted that the fact that ADD, established in 2013, from a small group of European economists, was able to become a serious political force.
Leadership in general has continued to hold the ruling HCS/HDS block, which has approximately 30 per cent.
However, the trend towards losing points is evident here - in April, Angela Merkel's support was four percentage points above.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which the Government of Germany has for the fourth time, is also declining.
Today, Angela Merkel is representing 48 per cent of Germans, 7 per cent below last year.
In addition, after the Social Democrats, "greens" (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent) were present.
Evolution "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Election 2013" group, in which the members of the Christian-Democratic Union entered.
The Group initially opposed the government course, but only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction, were at first.
While the group opposed the "sponsoring" of Germany's weak EU economies, it did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the Euro Union.
In the light of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group was formed in a full-value party that took up a European-sceptics niche and began to criticise the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG was able to take the first time in Bundestag, with 94 MPs (from 709).
Two alternate representatives for Germany were given seats in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist named Ukrainian citizens as "Bulvan's Nation"
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov in direct air, admitted that he considered his fellow citizens to be "the Bolwann nation".
They believe in television and they read little.
As Drozov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We do not embrace the culture of reading and acceptance of texts from our childhood," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Independent Radio began to fight against literature containing minor objections to the criticism of the Kyiv authorities, prohibiting imports of up to 201 publications.

Named after the time of death of the Universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world observed, about 13.8 billion years old.
The study of the international scientific community is presented in the library of electronic prints arXiv.org and is addressed to the publication of Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were made by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope for about ten million galaxies.
As a result of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the world's mass, scientists, working under the Standard Space Model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), assessed the expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than was previously considered.
The press release of Subaru noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of material in the universe, and the inclusion of data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new evidence to the effect that the world was to end its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Breakdown.
A regular attempt has been made to unite pension referencing initiators
The possibility of finding out the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow, on Saturday, a meeting of the All-Federal Initiative Group of the Referendum against the Increase in Pension Age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered various language issues (the whole of the Central Committee has registered five languages).
They decided to apply to the CIC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Do you think that, as of 1 July 2018, the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension should not be increased?"
The wording was recorded by a volo-yearly sub-group whose representatives did not participate in the congregation, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legal framework.
Most of the meeting participants were members of the Fair Russia, Eli Sviridov (six sub-groups) and CRC (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups were joined by the Netherlands, Virginia and Orenburg.
Sviridov had previously told the "Leaders", that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and that representatives had agreed to come to the group of about 40 sub-groups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Voluntary Sub-Group (it has supported another 15 sub-groups), said to the "Vedents", that the invitations had not been received or planned to come: "We did not understand who was the other and who was the enemy."
Death of the Blue Singer Otis Rash
At the age of 84, a well-known Chicago blue guitarist and singer Otis Rash died, reports AP with reference to his manager Rick Beits.
He died as a result of complications following stroke in 2003.
The creation of Mr. Rasha influenced musicians such as Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was widely known in 1956 after the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took on the sixth line of Billboard R&B.
"Admiral" has created a big problem for us.
Zinetula Billetdinov: "Admiral" has created a big problem for us.
Master coach Ak Bars Zinétul Billetdinov led the match of regular CHL champion against Admiral (4:2).
"The simple game was complicated.
The rival was a worthy warrior, creating big problems for us.
It's a pleasure that we've played a good game today in the majority.
I've already said that the naked will come, the main thing for us to work on.
And that we have won, too, very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danny Zaripov a preview in this series?"
"We have our program on which he works.
That's why it was such a solution," says Billetdine's Press Service Club.
Ilon Mask leaves the head of the board of directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will have to resign the chairmanship of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
However, the businessman maintains the position of the company's Chief Executive Director, the AFP reports with reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Earlier, the regulator filed a claim against Ilon Maska - officials believed that he had misled the investors of Tesla because the businessman had allowed all the shares of the company to be redeemed at a high price - $420 per paper.
In Loko's match, Ahmat's mistakes Turbine fell out of the corner of abundance.
The former world-class judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Eugenia Turbina, a 9th-century Russian Lokomothi champion, Ahmat, and picked up the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgenia Turbina in the Locomotiv match, Ahmat?
- I believe that the referee confirmed her inconsistencies with the Russian prime minister.
I am surprised that the efforts made at the 5th Spartak Tour - Dinamo, either Turbin itself or the DSI leaders have not made serious conclusions about its low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth tour: errors in his actions, private lapses of rough receptions fell from the corner of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's train, he's going down with his hands in his crime scene, Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a pendulum.
- How do you rate the episode with Idou, who was at the 82nd minute when it turned out that the ball fell into his hand?
- I think there was an intentional play by a defense guard in his crime scene.
Turbin was close to the moment, well seen this episode and his first assistant on the right.
The moment had to be seen by the reserve judge, Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score is distorted, and sports justice has been violated.
It was the same case when a court of opinion drew out and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin decided not to remove the defender of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules against Krichovak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he was admirably flattered.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second cook?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed up not exactly on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of justice that some teams are being penalized for violations such as Idova's episode, and there is no one.
What do you appreciate the words of the footballer?
- See what you can understand under double standards.
It was a pendulum.
They didn't give it to him.
So, the referee doesn't give the second pendulum in the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
That's what he was doing on Saturday, Locomotiv, and Ahmata, there are serious claims to the work of Turbine, because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the defendant in rape by the judge of Kawano at the SNL
U.S. actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of a new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on the NBC TV.
During a small shoot, the actor played Cavano at the hearings in the rape prosecution Senate.
The candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories during his interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Yes, Kawano repeatedly admitted in his love for beer, but he said that he had never been drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Kawano stated that he was a virgin in those years.
The moments were also played by Damon.
I just did a lot of drinking and didn't even think about sex.
I was the most proud, drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone's famous," said the judge in execution of Matt Damon.
Previously, Kawano was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Strezand found in her cloned dogs a strange behavior.
American singer Barbra Strezand said that the clones of her dead dog were different from the original Pitome.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it's impossible to clone the soul," said 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Strezand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old cat dog named Samantha, who had to die from health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the Chihuahua dog, called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned in 49th time.
Specialists are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
United States dollars for oil and gas supplies to Russia's maritime blockade
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to gain a world power market advantage.
The U.S. authorities have been so determined to fight for the success of the world's carbon market that they are willing to flee to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
The head of the U.S. media recently told Ryan Zinke about the possibility of a maritime blockade.
In contrast to the world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civil servant, including a natural resource policy.
Zinke's statement was therefore fully within the authority of the department in charge, although political decoration was not lacking.
Speaking at industrial events in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. military forces controlled sea routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
Zinke noted that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world's energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion's share of its income from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, has been the main reason for the revitalization of Moscow in this region, Zinka is confident.
The Minister pointed out that the United States was still looking forward to providing leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To this end, Washington will have to strengthen Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, which is an acceptable measure, is considered by Zinke.
The Kalmuk director received good feedback from the festival
Our Earth, the actor Eugenia Sangaziev, and his movie "Harmony" (Garmony) are well-known for the special mention of the members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "The Movement", which took place in Mr. Omske.
The festival's festival said that "this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial film-making players."

The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Jana is Anja on the other hand" - the director's debut of Jana Gladki's actresses.
The focus of the National Film Festival of the Movement was on young film, but not on the age of decision-makers, but on their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And the Elystine School of Arts, P. Chonkušov and RATI-HITIS Evgenius Sangajiev, meets all of these requirements.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and British Constable John Terry is about why he visited the 9th Tour of Russia's Spartak Championship (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I follow.
I've been following him recently and I've been interested in looking at him from the side.
I can't say that I'm a patient, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but the sympathy for Spartacus I have and I want to apologize for the decision made," says Terry's Chelsea Hospital's website.
Remember, Rustov with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and Spartak was on the fifth line, with 15 points active.
On the next tour, on 7 October, the red and white are playing with Eniseem, and Valerie Carpina will receive Orenburg on the day before.
The road script was put in the locker for no price.
When a man in the city of Somerville (Massachussets) had brought the LBC Boutique and Loan a violin, he offered only $50 for an old and unpretentious tool.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan Mcdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from the expert.
Here it was found that the script was produced in 1759 by famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and was valued at $250,000.
Only one screws are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the script had not been stolen so long in one of the city's inhabitants, and the instrument had returned to the rightful owner.
Until we know how the script came to the man who put it in the locker, but there are no past clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring the violin into the locker will ask to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are looking forward to a striking contrast: Spartacus will take to his stadium in Rostov, in the direction of Valerie Karpin, a man, as it is known, not a "national team".
The speciality of this meeting adds that the clubs now have an equal number of points - by 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-off Zenita and in one corner of Crasnodar, which is playing with Dinama tomorrow.
In the red-and-white area now, the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the Massimo Carrera team suddenly flew into Rapidu, and recently moved into the Ahmatu house.
After a break with the CSCA, which ended with a fair deal, Spartacus with a minimum account, and not without a job, took the Black Sea in Cuba, and as soon as he spoke about whether Russia's most popular club was approaching the exit of the crisis.
"Rostos" three matches could not win, because even the losers don't know five.
Let's see if Karpina can continue the unfavourable series as a matchmaker.
The previous meeting of the Karpina Rostov with Spartacus ended in favour of the capital team.

But I don't think it's a big role for peoples to understand, and for peoples to work, it's not a big deal," said a specialist at the RIA News.
According to the translator, to understand that two countries do not go together without each other, "enough to know the story."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no point ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.

The "School Tonight" comedy led by the American Box Office
Tonight's school, which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in the rocket.
This resulted in an unimaginable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the main role of the U.S. box office in 28-30 September.
In the international market, films, while only in 20 countries, amounted to $5.5 million, including 2 million of British audiences.
In the struggle for the first line of creation, Malcolm Li, which is remarkable enough, has overcome another novelist of the Western Prokrat, the Mult of Smallfoot, a curious story of the knowledge of a promising life with a representative of the human race, in which the chief hero never believed.
The project of directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig for their initial outputs collected $23 million, generally justifying the expectations of experts predicting 20-25 million per week.
With regard to Smolfoot's summary fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (but it has already been debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, with a fine of 3.6 million.
Three of the strongest of them have this time closed the story of "The Secret of the Hour" from the horror master Elijah Roth, finally proving that the director is capable of making a quality film and for the 12+ audience.
In his second week, John Bellers' screenplay with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blancett earned $12.5 million, bringing total world peace to 53.8 million.
Despite a trip from top-3, he continues to be surprised by the mark "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick: 17 days in the American picture of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial performances were not expected to be "very much", collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has up to 62.9 million total salaries.

Spin-off for the 24 days in the United States (and not only, of course) cinemateaters have a $330 million total salary and, from recent times, they are proud to be called the most successful French film, which also includes two parts of the "Call" itself and two tapes about the yellow Annabel doll.
Next to the horror of Corin Hardy last weekend, another representative of the genre, deputant Halifax, was present, one of the main youth horrors.
In his first child, a well-known installer (and recent directors), Gregori Platkin, who had previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", where "Helfest" places were very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
In view of the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "Unreasonably rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to have no idea how to get out of the top-10 U.S. box office: a romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as a result of September, is the sixth in the ranking of the most cash registers of genres for the entire history of 165.7 million.
That is what the picture has been working on in the internal market for the time being, and the total volume of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three luckys who fell to the U.S. assembly in September 28-30, they became "The Priest", "The White Boy Rick" and "The Bad Man", who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million last weekend respectively.
We add that in the next outbounds in the United States, we will gather a long-term "Venna" with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, has been the lead in the U.S. box office as a result of the first exits in October.
Of the other prime minister of the week, it's worth the award of the "Star Born" music, the award of the Venice Film Festival by Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate".

Valerie Belov: Lord helped Sibiri today.
Master coach "Vitazija" Valerie Belov - about the defeat of "Sibiri" (3:4) in the match of regular CHL champion.
"Collega spoke of Sibiri's patients, and I want to mention our patients," says the White official website "Vitazja".
"I hope they will do the same because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
By the game, it must have been the Lord who helped Sibiri today, because they've made a very big mistake, especially our leaders.
We've actually lost a micro -- a 0:3 match, our leading leaders, so it's hard to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'm still going to blame myself.
Because I think we've missed something in preparation.
It was a second team compared to the last match."
"It's a stupid chum."
Viewers are upset by Agutin's choice of voice show.
The viewers of the "Golos 60+" show accuse Leonid Agutin of being a "unsuitable cougar and naked undercover."
When he first heard his father, Nikolay Agutina, in blind hearings, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the executive.
But the son’s feelings were taken up, and he chose a relative in his team.
At that time, many felt that it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for not objectivity at the first stage.
But the joke was over, and the star's father was absolutely unfairly taking the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show viewers, were upset by the chumourless and exposed protease of our relatives on the final ladder.
I was even suspicious that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to reach the end of her dad until the first place," said Irina Petrovski and Xenia Larin in the TV program.
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin, the "slid" of the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovic was singing a trade song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father's show.
But, as it turns out, the viewers want an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and Agutin discredited the show.
"I can feel the Voice from the Agutina team - they've been engaged."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loved his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"Koncurs lost his mind."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project their dad who doesn't drink and jokes, how can you then be called a teacher?"
"Like a poet, organize a concert in Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cool family show.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutina."
"Then you have to invite your own show to speak to the Pope, not to the show that is made for the money of 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the silent pope should make me understand more than any other party with real eye data.
Why did the workman from Surgut go with a loud voice and a timbre and bring Pope Agutina to the final?
And then we're all complaining about the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
'Cause it won't go through the kitchen.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
The circle of mud and camouflage.
Yes, and the family budget will be no more!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Volus" in blind hearings, the son of the city was gone.
Then the subway and the head didn't have to take the son to their own team.
Besides, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

The scholar told about the possible RF expedition programme on the Moon
The head of the Institute of Space Research RAN, a member of the RAN correspondent Anatolius Petukovic, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now developing the direction of such work.
"Consolidated opinion is not yet available," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was the placement of a low-frequency radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would help to avoid interference with earth ' s source.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio broadcasting," Petrukovic added.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to carry out tests by workshops, use local resources for construction.
In addition, the spacecraft must be brought to the search for a primitive Earth satellite, considered by the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planet.
A former head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that an FF-optimistic option could take place on the moon by 2030.
Circumstance client pulled out a box of chocolates at 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called the "name of a tooth" on the 7-Eleven network store manager: in May, he exposed him from the store for an unpleasant conduct.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and went out on the floor and on some of the items on the boxes containing the basket.
There were feces and urine in the basket, which Simms had "looped" from a nearby mobile biotourette.
Police arrests on the scene of the hostage.
He was placed in prison and released to the court in default at $300.
He was charged with illegal invasion of foreign property and criminal offences and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms seemed more ridiculous than serious, the trial could be severe enough, as he had repeatedly violated the law: he was charged with large-scale theft, illegal possession of weapons, incestuous driving and ill-treatment of animals.
In the United States, Russia's most terrible storm
The most terrible enemy submarine for the U.S. fleet will be the Russian flag of the Kazanj project "Jasen-M", writes The National Interest.
The submarine was landed on water in March 2017, but the military fleet will receive it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, the Severodvinsk submarine, received an appreciation of American soldiers.
We'll face a severe potential opponent.
Just look at "Severodvinsk," quoted The National Interest Counter Admiral Dave Johnson.
The publication writes that the United States retains the advantage of this industry in front of Russia.
The multi-purpose atomic submarines of Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Arkangelsk are built on the improved project of "Jasen-M" (885M).
They have 13 800 t water storage depth - 520 m, crew - 64 people, autonomy - 100 days, underwater speed - 31 taken.
Submarines are equipped with mines, 533 mm torpedo, Onex and Calibr wing rockets.
In August, the 6th U.S. fleet reported that the U.S. submarines remained “the most powerful and frightening on the planet”.
German policies have ignored the opening of the castle because of Erdoğan
The Prime Minister of the Federal Land North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Lashet and Mayor Kelna Henrietta Recker ignored the opening ceremony of the new city mosque.
That's what Deutsche Welle says.
The event was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan.
Lašet met Erdogan at Kelna Airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could turn into a “very politicized event”.
She reported that she had received an informal invitation to open on Friday, 28 September.
According to her press secretary, such a proposal should be considered as late and irrelevant.
In the square before the mosque, Erdogan presented the results of a two-day visit to Germany.
The President called them successful, he said he was able to meet with FRG President Franco-Walter Steinmeyer and Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had discussed the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new castle in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe, and it is able to accommodate about 1.1 thousand believers at the same time.
Construction amounted to EUR 30 million, and funding was provided by the Turkish side.
Ivanov will be able to become a watermelon, a spadeologist or an alpineist.
These activities will be carried out by the Youth Rescue Club located in the district centre.
However, these three interesting professions do not limit the club's activities - audiences of numerous courses and seminars will also be able to learn the parsley case, disaster medicine, parachutes, and get basic knowledge of psychology.
For example, the knowledge of listeners is not only theoretical - the club's program also provides practical collections.

- German Mikhailovic, how do you play Eurofeeva?
- You know, I really liked the game.
Emotional, nothing more than we asked.
He walked on the door and created moments like an episode with Vitaly Kratzov when he didn't hit the empty door.
He was very impressed with the first game.
I think we'll get him to play further.

They were represented by an ex-MVD staff member of Ukraine, who is currently working as an agent of one of Ukraine's insurance companies.
According to the press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle was in search of Interpol since 2014 and was therefore detained in the territory of Russia and transferred to him as a representative of the insurance company.
At the crossing of the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fecal numbers, but when entering Kiev he re-established them.
He said that he did so “to ensure compliance with the registration car numbers of the packages for the specified machine issued by the Russian representatives of Interpol in the event of a stopover of a vehicle for inspection by the Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures are currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities”, said the SBI.

Zinke also noted that the situation was similar with Iran.
For its decision, the Minister considered that there were two options for the development of events: military and economic.
The first would have preferred not to use, so it would have to be pressured and drained by Iranian energy.

Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Pri Russia race.
"I'm honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I was between the two cars that I was sorry for right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the beginning, right now.
It turned out to be a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
They were hoping that after the rest of us go down the pit stop, we'll fall into the clean air, and we'll be back in a hurry, but the reindeer's gone.
Plus, he fought with his partner, and he was in touch with him.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We've been in this situation on the most unobtrusive track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful if it was true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin's RIA News.
Remember that Sirotkin was the 18th winner in the race in Gran-pri Russia, and the British pilot "Mersedes" was Louis Hamilton.
I called the absurd removal of Glushakova and Eštenko from the base of Spartaca
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpištev commented on the removal of Moscow's "Spartaka" footballers Denis Glušakova and Andrea Ešchenko from training with the main composition after the laity of the team's chief coach Masimo Carreira, reports "Sport Weikend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unscrupulous nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It just deepens the breakdown in the team.
First, these are verses, read and understand them as you please.
I wouldn't have reacted to this at Carrera's place.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury.
If deaf people and Estenko make jokes, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I don't think the Italian has enough flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve as a normal climate in the team.
The Spartacus has no games today, so this situation has not been required to break up.
Maybe when it was time to laugh about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of inconsistencies in different lines, and there is a lack of harmony with youth.
The internal relations of the teams, judging as a matter of fact, do not add optimism to this match," Tarpichev is certain.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 7 p.m. in Moscow time.
A former "Sportaque" John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Sirius students discussed science-based environmental technologies
The students of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended the lecture of the National Research Centre "Kurchavski Institute".
The presentation of researchers was made within the framework of the Global Forum on Convergence and Environmental Technologies organized in Sochi, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, is reported on the website of the Education Centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film "Kodi Kurcchaov", during which the President of the Kurcchav Institute, RAN co-rapporteur Michael Kovalchuk, described the global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture published on the Sirius site.
Schoolers have learned that modern technologies need an enormous amount of energy.
Alternative energy has not yet been able to produce such quantities.
To address this problem, according to forum organizers, will help the environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised responsibility for the development of environmental technologies, as well as for risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge favor.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of environmental technologies is actually the technological reproduction of natural systems.
There is a turning point: targeted intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
There was a car, and people walked under the wheels.
But cars still use them.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass loss," quoted REN TV as saying.
After a review of the film and discussion of the current scientific breakthroughs, the school members were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The speaker was the candidate for physical and mathematical sciences, head of the NBICS NBICS-natural-like technology NIC "Kurchavska Institute" Julia Djakova and head of the NBICS-Technology NBICS-Vycheslav Demin.

Macedonia: The referendum did not take place due to the low phenomenon
The referendum was called upon to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The name has led the former Yugoslav Republic to open its way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE, only 34 per cent of the cases in the resurrected plebiscite “did not touch” the constitutional threshold to 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse to rename.
As soon as the polls were closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, the advocate of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if more "yes" appeared among the votes, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the unaccompanied quorum.

Cameroon’s Warfare Contradicted
On 30 September, a report appeared on the famous Khmer page on the social network, indicating that the rudder animals were freely dissipated in one of the local shelters.
The small herd of animals passed between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed their differing views: some of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small hornet on the site, and their appetite could even help to clean up the territory from the weeds and the grasses, but some of the city's inhabitants did not have to breathe:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's something for the barrans to do.
Of course, you will not say that they're expensive, but it's not the case."
Either way, one of the observatories noted that the animal-mediated problem was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Let's get out of here, how's it going?
There is no word of pressure.
That's right.
The word "smoothing" means "smoothing, exerting influence, impacting" is only phonetic, because we hear a sound instead of "smoothing".
We use this word, assuming it's going from the word "press."
But "press" and "extending" not only are not just close, but even in some sense are opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Getting away (cerk.-book, old) means "full enough, full enough, enough to be enough for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Have fun, have fun, have family words.
Previously, it was still important "not to depend on anything, to be self-sufficient" - "to be self-sufficient."
The ancient Slavic "devil" by the family "breath" and "voice".
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
In these words, the now frightening "family": Daos is "wolves", die is "to die" and "to distress" in the spirit.
A similar phenotic form of the words "press" and "full", as well as the imminent ageing of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we had the same "d" as they used in the letter "a", which is, better, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Well, that's right.
But that word is outdated, in its proper sense no longer being used.
If you want to note that some circumstances/people have a negative influence on you above, use the word "smooth."
You can also use the design "to show pressure", but remember that it is an office.

Our machine is noticeably slowing "Messedes"
"Ferrary" pilot Kim Rykkonen is about the qualifications of Gran-pri Russia, which led him to take the fourth place.
"Who, did you have a chance to fight for the pool today?
How good was the car?"
"It looks like Mercedes was a lot faster today," says Rickkonen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car has been the best since the beginning of Wik-end."
"In the course of the qualification, you did not enter the speed of Sebastian Fettel, but eventually the retreat was noticeable.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was not bad, but then it turned out to be some Mercedes.
He was ready to try, and he could have missed me, but it seems I've lost some time.
However, this has hardly had a major impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to wrap, the race starts as a key moment?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it goes.
It's not going to be easy in any case, because our car notices a slower Mercedes machine.

The flower really deserves a place in Formula-1.
The Russian fighter Michael Alešin is about the return of the associate Daniel Kwata to Formula 1 as the Toro Rosso pilot.
I think it's just amazing news: Formula 1 will have another Russian pilot, and it will be Dana.
I think he really deserves this place, and he hasn't said everything in Formula 1.
Yes, often not everything was as it should be, and I think he hasn't even realized a part of his capacity yet.
It will be interesting to observe his statements in the coming year," says Aleshin SMP Racing.

With the assistance of the operation in Syria, Russia has turned its back on terrorists
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85 thousand of them destroyed the FF Air Space Force.
In connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the WCS, head of the Federal Defence and Security Council Committee, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-fighting equipment: Air-space forces were inflamed and continued to strike precisely on terrorist sites.
According to Bondareva, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, for example, about the stockpiles of munitions, reinforcements and headquarters.
With the help of the Russian aircraft, the defence of the Georgians has been broken, which has become a crucial contribution to the advance of the Syrian Government's troops, the interface is being transmitted.
However, according to Bondareva, our military operations in Syria have allowed Russia itself to be protected from terrorists, many of whom were Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, prohibited in Russia) and the Djibouti-an-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the Gender of the Armed Forces, some 4,000 Russian civilians were on the side of the IG and about five thousand post-Soviet nationals were transferred to the TAS.
And this is only about registered persons, not to mention those who have not been identified, said Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country.
Thus, he noted that in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism in the far-off countries - otherwise, this evil would be “deceptive to us”.
Boris Johnson's telephones and a number of British ministers went to public access

According to the TV, a number of politicians have received “unsatisfying calls”.
The technical problem has been resolved, and the application is now safe.
We are studying the causes of failure and apologizing for any problems caused," said the Conservative Party.
In the worst cases, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in politicians and journalists' profiles.
Thus, in the profile of the Minister for the Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gowa replaced his photograph with a picture of the mediamagnet Rupert Merdok.
Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian MIDI, Valid Muallem, accused the United States and their partners of military crimes in Syria and the support of terrorism.
The [West] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rhaka, destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are military crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners have provided “direct support to terrorists”, as the objectives of the troops and the Western coalition in Syria have coincided with and meant “a seed of chaos, death and destruction on their way”.
The head of the IMI also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete, and the country had become more secure and stable.
The museum added that Damascus was also planning to clear Syria from illegal foreign presence and priority in restoring the country would be given to Syrian partners.

Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I protect the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Provenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are not, either east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of Midi in the passport scandal with Hungary, which was intended to send the country ' s consulate from Beregovo.
"I completely divide every letter that has been said by IID," said the President.
As FACTY reported, a video appeared on the network on September 19th, which recorded the time for Ukraine's citizens to issue their passports to the Hungarian Consulate in Bergow.
In so doing, they obeyed the oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Pavel Klimkin, noted that the Hungarian Consul, who is on video with Hungarian passports, had to leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.

More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the beginning of an armed conflict in Syria for seven years.

The Syrian authorities also called upon the world community to promote and allocate refugees.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, claiming that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with fascist actions
The head of the Synod of the External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mr. Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
"It is equally true that in the Fascist Germany, Jews would have a yellow ostracism star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that for this purpose this bill was established," said the Mittropolit at the Russian 24 teleconnaissance (interfax quote).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences now that the Russian-Ukraine conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control of the UPC and to “put it out of the law”, the minister believes.
"These Ukrainian churches, and the believers of this church, are considered Ukrainians, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it was known that members of the Supreme Council were working on the implementation of Bills No.4128 (to change the subjectivity of religious communities), No.4511 (to change the status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (to change the name of religious organizations).
The latter is intended to rename the PPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy Pochaevska Lavra called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The Deputy Sveto-Uspenska Pocaevska Lavra Mittropolit Vladimir called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on the site of the inhabitants on Saturday.
At different times, our predecessors and relatives in the faith and spirit of the Christian congregation had to establish their faith and protect their holiness.
Taking into account the situation and the information we have and the threats of the ongoing trials, it is clear that we will have to survive," said the Metropolitan.
He asked for the support of a prayerful, moral one.
Also, the Lava substitute stressed that "your physical presence will probably be needed."
And the priest said: "The sons of Lenin are in the spirit, and they are in danger of a trial, and we are to defend our holy place."
Those who do not have the absolute destiny of the Pochaev Laver, the Orthodox Ukraine and the world sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, are referred to as being treated.
Mithropite called not for them who had believed to go astray.
UPC has a canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by Mother of the Church.
Now, someone wants to be dependent on a new style patriarch and another Catholic Pope of Rome.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the deputy of the Laver.
He recalled that since October 1990, UPC has been able to be independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need, Tomos?" - said Mr. Pocaevsky Vladimir, calling on the believers and all the citizens to ask if there are any other confessions of Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believed in some measure were stirred up and determined which temple they were walking in.
However, someone wants to see the enemy and the riots again.
Some have become addicted to the light of the dome on the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The Lavre is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 km from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

If we continue to play right too, the win will come
Head coach of Moscow's Dinamo Vladimir Vorovyev - about the defeat of the "Automobilist" (0:1) in the match of regular CHL champion.
"The horror game was interesting, even though it went to the bare end" - the word "Vorobjeva" is the official Automobilista website.
"They tried to play very simply.
I really liked the first time.
They didn't use a few good points.
During the second period, our opponent gave us a bit of a blow, and we stood up.
But we've got a little bit of a "crazy" removal.
The guys played well, they did the training.
I think if we keep playing right, the win will come.
They didn't kill, they didn't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
Good luck if we keep playing in this direction."
"In your opinion, the Automobiler added in comparison to the meetings in Lower New York?"
"Then there was no foreign bell.
In the pre-season, the teams had other tasks, many young people played.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
The Automobileist is a good charity team.
The tournament table makes it clear that the team is playing correctly.
A good hockey, a kind atmosphere, and on the arena, and in the city.
They can only wish for success.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good doorman.
It was hard, we're ready.
They knew the team was going without any damage, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

Macedonia's main opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, 30 September, a referendum was held on the question of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"

50% of the Taliban movement (restricted in FP).
Another 10% for IGIL terrorists (prohibited in RF).

And Greece will secure the right of its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy."

Against the conservative opposition and president of the country of George Ivanov.
According to the journalist Tvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no idea of joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with them: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government in the head with Zave is forced from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have a negative impact.
I'm going to lose sovereignty first.
There are obviously countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country has fallen apart.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine not only the future of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole."
