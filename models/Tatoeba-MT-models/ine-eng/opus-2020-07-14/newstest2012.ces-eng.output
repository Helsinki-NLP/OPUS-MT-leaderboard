Parliament did not support a novel liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to cancel within the framework of the new criminal law paragraph, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment that would open the way for the release of the prisoner's victim was rejected by the Members at second reading the proposal for a reduction of penalties for economic delicacy.
In October, Germany was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into a seemingly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal against the defendant shall be brought by the court in December.
Tymoshenko marks a judgment for the regime's political verdict, suspects from the court's inception have also called for a trial in the West.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 from the criminal law, on the basis of which the expert was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
For his approval, 226 votes were needed.
Libya's Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
There's still a definition of the winner.
As is customary in the country, in the election of the victorious Islamists, it's about whether or not the settlement is radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of the Sharia and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because a hand is cut by theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, if any faith-based waste waiting for correction and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There's gonna be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
Only our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and probably not the so-called Libyans for change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors took credit for the help of the faithless dogs.
It is only a pity that from their point of view NATO did not lead a general of America, but Allah, whose size at every given intervention, celebrated.
So if they're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong between them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians escaped the political alliance in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't buy military.
This drop is a problem with the removal of the "crusts".
But are they going to have no company of oil for the Libyan black gold lip?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to enjoy the unfavorable protection of human rights.
So if we don't get a chance to do this, we're not gonna let you know the law of the Sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe went to search for investors
The statistical disaster was overrun across Europe on Tuesday.
The individual States have published the HDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy was stagnantly stagnant, Germany and France are growing.
The long-term market, but today, it's the record market.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical authorities in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's HDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data in the second quarter, where Germany was better off than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France stated that it was found in a slight decline of 0.1% (original data were referring to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, over a quarter of a year, the gross domestic product (HDP) was stagnant and, according to the ČSU, it confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than analytical estimates.
Most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but stagnantly.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally calculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent between the years.
Her 10-year-old debt account is 28.45%.
The outputs of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel even Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The Czech 10-year-old bonds account for less than 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, it seems that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million process
The football performance was the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brown Peter Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football, with a lot of luck in the second half of the year, has pulled the luxury jump from home and won't miss the European championship again.
IHNED.cz was monitoring the progress in the detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech representation and thanks to the domestic death in marriage, the great Czech Republic and the hero Jiráčov won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
For the precise defence of the Czech population, the Montenegrins got to the pressure until the second half.
The fighting smolderers became Damjanovic and the Dominic, who burned two great odds.
Even thanks to the great Czech representation of Peter Czech, there will be no shortage of Europe's championships next year, plus the reward of some 200 million crowns in foreign football.
A lot of fighting football has been playing since the opening minutes.
Both teams were just hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the semi-trailer.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, and the long defenses were being rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several sets of high school students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their gesture of support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday morning, the students prayed before the object and then spent the death of the United States and Israel.
Several of the students of the University of Isfahan in Iran created a living shelter around the Isfahan nuclear technology centre, where uranium is processed.
They suggest that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran, in all respects, did not cease to strive for nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is being referred to in Israel.
The students prayed in the afternoon before entering the isfahan nuclear facility and then spent the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme as much as possible, it would be, according to Israeli pressure, in addition to the isfahan centre, for the purpose of the installation in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Obtained child's menu: not eating and eating
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with an excessive weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and dependents being 5 per cent of children.
Adolescents, however, usually come from a family with an unhealthy lifestyle, as shown by current research.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns in which it is wrapped.
For example, on the table in pregnant children, females are less than half of the time in families with normal weight.
The fried pancakes had no chance of more than 19 per cent of them being spent for dinner prior to the research related to the light action called Obezita.
There is also no habit of sports in gang families, but most of the families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The research was carried out at the end of last year’s school year and attended by 900 children from basic schools from all over Czech Republic.
It was already the second anniversary of Obezita's action is not an accident that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
The right feeding and sufficient movement in the family is, however, one of the factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, stated that she had been in breakfast-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," one of the results of the research.
No breakfast and dinner dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development, there are also significant and relative details, including regular family breakfast time.
In Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren are in the same period.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst was finding out that in ten households he didn't eat at all.
Breakfast, then, is the basis for the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in pregnant children’s families, poor diets are much more common.
Almost every - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 per cent).
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, their parents had less than half the result - 15 percent.
Set up your dining room.
The next part of the study allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up of the options offered by their own dining room according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dissatisfaction of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of wet, massive and sweet foods.
"The alarm is in particular a large form of sweet lemonades," the final survey report states.
At lunch as the main meal, the pasta won directly over the poultry.
However, children practically didn't want to be caught and the shape of fish and frozen vegetables was low.
Health Annex
At the same time, the research has shown that children are willing to adjust their feeding habits if they receive the correct information.
"In the review group of participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the lighting lecture, Obezita is not an accident, in a number of cases a significant shift of preference was made towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are indicated.
For example, it was marked by sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Also, children were more often inflamed in the fish and poultry questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and nuts.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard-earned professionals.
In the opening article on how to teach stylistics, I had so little experience that it had been a lot in the opening hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, the clothing of problematic posts and the seminar on how it works.
And it'll get worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks we have.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "caught."
This time we were discussing with Director Alenko (there is not one boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly consistent attitude.
And that's what most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy's attitude, no proper curves, and someone's over-exposure.
The stylist must know how to optically change the broad shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've got guys like Jennifer Lopez's women, so bigger breasts and sides and tight belts, I'll be very impressed and at the same time don't dress a woman too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the side is such that the skirts or pants do not really sit, then it will pay to keep at least one such piece in peace.
You will certainly not regret it because the perfectly falling clothes are for non-payment.
In a dress at peace you will feel much better than in a dress that keeps changing you, hugs you, stays in a walk, and so on.
A boy’s attitude may allow him to wear clothes with tear, application, sweating or pickup.
Of course, this kind of information is a lot, so I'm glad that I've got all week to put all the information in my head.
And I'm afraid, given the homework assigned, it's up to now.
Each of the courses received a dedicated celebrity, which is intended to invent two outfits: day and night.
We need to take into account the current view, fashion style of the given personality and type of position.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am personally better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently taken a hundred pounds (or, please, in the underside of the roof), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the sheets out of the magazines or search the Internet and print and then process the graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result says, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in journals (on specific tasks, such as trendy cables, cables, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But it's until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
On Saturday's lecture with information on the types of posts, three of the guests from the field were arrested.
Stylist Honza Korný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a slick stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
In this case, variability is key.
So you have to wear a piece like that (or if you want to start a piece of trenchcoat) you can wear classic across the jeans and shirts as a coat, but you can also dress it up on a bare body, round the boat and picture it as a dress.
Or just to pick up the gloves or the straps, and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I assessed the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are all concerned with what we can combine with, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines.
You don't even talk about surveillance.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist must have prepared a lot more choice of clothes than how many are going to take pictures.
So in the fashion story, which will have ten pages (then ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "post" at least fifteen.
And it also looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different than in fact.
So that's what we have to do when we make the outfit.
That the image and style make up half the success, Honza Pokorný confirmed.
Just look at Madonna, who's not just a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing made her the world's old man.
In Czech Republic, access to the use of stylistic services is far colder.
Even the familiar faces of her are considered to be extraneous (unless I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone from us is going to create a styling, then we have to calculate that with great probability he imposes on us a completely different size (less) than he really does.
Then there's nothing left but to google and find out if the bulwark didn't say that the celebrity in question was in vain and so on.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday at the heart that the stylists are not enough to guide themselves in fashion and to manage the outfit.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he wears, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To honor people, not to complain, to stand up for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to order her a dresser and fill her up on nice pieces, you can't go out the whole box and say, God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what they are able to carry," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything must contain the so-called "placow" or the bag on the spot.
It's the one you turn around the belt and you have all the necessary properties.
In addition to clear things, such as knives, hairdressing, or closing spindles, there is also a silon thread (with it the stylist helps with the photo of products such as cables or hats), special clips that we turn behind the dress if it is larger (the spindle or other screws are not allowed, they would destroy clothes), or a shirt.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick our shoes properly.
And when you're taking a picture in the studio, where there's a flat surface, the scarf could hurt itself, but out.
And so we're stickers and stickers.
We can't even touch the boots so they don't get hurt by chance.
So there's a real need for engagement.
Mario made me happy when my creation without exception praised me.
I'm not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
I'm starting to be as clear as it is to be dedicated to styling at the professional level as it really isn't a walk of pink fruit, whoever wants to say to himself what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Originally unannounced rides change in the routine morning of the track due to a series of completely left-wing errors.
Ambition has done a great deal of work, but it's not worth anything when it's obvious that no one wanted to do anything else.
A new piece with the title The Run woke up before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that by flying the race series Need for Speed would again move a piece in the new direction and from the playable shows appeared as a game that in the race of action would not only be counted.
We were also curious about how the inserted passports, in which the main hero would come out of the car and go after his own.
As with the NFS series, many are in the result of a little different than we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down several remaining errors that appear in the series for more than a few years.
So it's not really a mistake, but it's rather a manifestation of some sort of incomprehensible initiative of developers.
Adventure is starting very well.
You are mentioned in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution he offers to participate in an illegal race against America.
You will be seated on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to get to New York as the first.
The idea is that there are several interesting elements.
The track is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It turns out that each race goes on a different course and the stages are involved in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't even have a moment to feel like the game is still the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous series parts.
So it's nothing global.
But the ride across the desert, the underground landscape or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the competitions have been staged by some non-typical element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you get into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be caught by the wool.
Besides, they're pretty good at being hit by a single race.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
This is how you try to spend the required number of competitors (mostly a classic race), then you get back to the time (classical fight with your feet) and then you need to wait for a duel with the only opponent.
The police will also be involved from time to time, which continues to make your efforts more difficult.
The news is passing out of the car.
It's more about such interactive animation when Jack most of the time pushes before someone and you have to help him so that at the right time you print the right button.
It's not complicated.
It will surprise you, though, that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (in particular, maybe only three).
As a result, however, it is for the benefit of things, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, it is a matter of the elements that threaten the game.
The riding model goes in the feet of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely no longer anyone today, but it can't be said to be a resistance.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more familiar the race here is still quite good, even though we could find better in competition.
By the way, everything's fine.
But problems start to develop after a while.
Unlike the vehicle model, it's no longer a good model.
From games of this type we don't expect complex deformations and collisions, but if you don't have the least idea how your car is kept, then it's probably not all right.
Typically when driving or changing cars in regular operation, you will sometimes only easily heal each other, but otherwise in almost identical situations your car will end in wild pirates.
Or even a straight attack.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it doesn't matter at all, but it'll make you feel more confident.
The restarts are solved so that if you break up or go far outside the track, you will be thrown back to the last catch point on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
When you cut them out, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help in case you don't say anything than you could say something about them.
Sometimes, however, even restarts will not help, it will be necessary to learn to remember the race.
The big inhaler of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some loops are needed in a specific way, otherwise you will not be able to see them briefly.
You will meet again at the "civil" location always in the same configuration either first, five, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
The anger is especially in situations where you can see the competition between two anti-trafficking cars in front of you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to drive them or speed them up.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will find several places where you, once again, no matter the time, always run the same opponent in the same place.
Mostly it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
If it goes in front of you, it's going to make you worse in the anti-trafficking car list, so you're starting to get a lot more and more out of it.
The intention is to make the game more tense and adrenaline, but the implementation is so obvious that it will be done away with you in a reliable way.
And it's a shame, because even through a simple driving model, it's playing fun and places and so much action that sometimes you literally don't try to follow where you're flying.
And it essentially doesn't matter whether it deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, a series of races so that the nude doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
The non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the road, because you can change the car right there, even though in most cases you can stop what you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sporters are suitable for urban areas, strong American bourbons on equal distances and exotic supersports on technical driving, for example, after clicking mountain roads.
With the main story mode, hand in hand and way of challenge, which are competitions in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To obtain a higher level of drivers, different items are removed: they start cars and end up with backgrounds for profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the on-line Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understanding digs is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your vehicle you will reach the tunnel of the metro where you will find it in the dark of your wheels.
On the tachometer, you can see the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (stay) and in the background, you can reach the meter and you will be uncompromising.
In the editorial we'll probably have a few more days to discuss whether nobody really thought about making the game, or whether the authors really have such a big fool.
The technical game page is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It's so cold that in some of the more drunken moments, it's a little bit tragic, in some cases.
However, this applies mainly to a drill with a larger number of participants, when you would no longer be able to use a flashlight.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to love the widest scale the younger audience created soundtrack from the category "every other dog", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game will probably not be bought.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so dismal.
If the game was to be avoided with a complete remaining error, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS for the last few years.
That's how the game works.
It's definitely good fun, but be prepared to see that mistakes will blow into your eyes by the force of the airport reflectors.
The UK Singing Councils will sing at the Student Summit concert
The association of the International Day of Study and the Year of the Samet Revolution with a musical experience offers the third festival of Festa Academica.
During it, it is represented in twenty high school and high school singing congregations.
The main focus of the festival is two concerts held on 17 November.
"University of Karlova has a great share in the festival."
"One of the participating congregations is the Pévecký spleen of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies, the director of the festival committee Václav Hampl," said the leader of the organisation team, Jakub Čaloun.
At the end of the festival, the public is freely available a concert of high school congregations, which will take place on 17 November from 14 hours away from the National Technical Library in Djvice.
On the program is a composition of a significant Czech jazzman Karl Rožičky Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Summit" will be held in the halls of the National House at Vinohradech, which will be attended by the colleges, including the singing congregations of the University of Karlov.
Festa Academy aims not only to celebrate the International Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samet Revolution, but also to present the public music at the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The main contractor is the Union of Czech Singing Congregations in cooperation with the Gymnasium Jan Kepler.
Throughout the event they took over the protection of the Prime Minister of Prague Bohuslav Freedom and Rector of the University of Karlov Václav Hampl.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
The harmonogram also offers in addition to the performances of the concerts of the whole series of music meetings, the student's happening, the mating and other shows.
Detailed information is available on the website of the festival www.festacademica.cz
Velwislandy at EU Vicen:
Czechs have the reputation of negotiators and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly undermined the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little settled, calms down, and all the players will get used to their new roles," the Czech embassy began her lecture at the Law School at the European Union Milena Vicenová.
Since its motto "Achievable and Open to Europe" is taken seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lecture when it was able to describe the individual EU authorities and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that it could envy a number of lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"The criticism has recently shown that it is not significant that it is the sixth official that can't play any role, and I must say that everyone's breathing out that the role has become excellent."
"It is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new High Representative's post for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in reply to the question, "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unity and greater readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to stop us from breast-feeding.
Vicenová has also dedicated itself to an agenda that the European Council has lived, and will live as soon as possible.
The Czech Presidency has been a success.
The Czechs solved the current financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or arranged a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's fall at this time was marked by a major negative that has been very severely damaging to the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very thorough.
The word "fmol fact" is said to have been not only a Presidency but also the next financial crisis that has been resolved so far.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be smooth and sustainable, which sectors will gain the advantage that the countries will be supported more and less, that is all in the order of the next negotiations.
She also remembered her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe Understandably".
"I really don't like bad shorts, foreign words, a gloves that no one understands.
How does a citizen understand that there are no curved or curved curds in Brussels, bananas of various sizes, or that someone really has to ban us from the acid."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the press, Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who are more aware of those negative than positive pages of things.
She also regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to it, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she then raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when Poland and Hungary are coming to me and the Slovak is approaching, the French next to me will say, "Hey, what are you hiding there, what are you doing with your Visegrad Four?"
In the future, according to the Vice-Presidents, there are, in particular, new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a very real then, the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, is more than a new "European Federation".
"We have a eurozone country and a country outside the eurozone."
"We have Schengen space, we have a strong cooperation institution."
"It was first said that they should cooperate only in countries that they want and those that do not want to be left behind."
"These institutions will be more and will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the adoption of the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.
Burning history:
IBM Innovator Starts the Second Century of His Existence
If anyone were to look for a word that would be the IBM strategy, it would probably be "longevity."
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company that is very current, and yet it has been established for hundreds of years.
Based on this longevity, the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already broken the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a print, about which the life of the future giant will take place (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to come into IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and then did not fear to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century, we will be able to achieve even more," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano for the year.
Processed system
Watson, in his thirties, had access to care for his employees, as did the Báča business in Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first US employees paid off, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system to reward the best employees and traders.
It also has a long-term IBM and a customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company has been brilliant in the challenge of talent - as one of the first world companies has abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that the Palmisana in front of IBM will set up a woman - Virginia Romatty next year.
It has been in IBM for thirty years, has thus far remained the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years IBM has made so-called jams, on-line brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are emerging.
It's not surprising that ideas are enough - it works in the company almost half a million people.
Good Name Institution
The firm's firm position in the business ensures the company's strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Forrester Research Consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market evenly.
IBM - or "Great Blue" - as it is seen in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most widely used technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in product scale from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents from all American technology companies and his five employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its findings include banknotes, payment cards, financial swaps, chain code or diskette.
IBM became the second largest technology firm in the market capitalisation (the first is Apple) this year, when Microsoft was first introduced in 1996.
Front View
Not all products and innovations come to the taste of customers and times - IBM for example did not rely on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the front, you can't get emotionally used to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which is basically standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM markets, the largest share of services is, after about five is made of software and hardware.
In 1990, however, he was with more than half the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-cost assets worth $15 billion, while it has also invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
The investment continues since 2008, when the first world was overrun by the modern financial crisis.
According to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, IBM, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is undergoing the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM's action since the beginning of 2008 has risen by 120 per cent, the net profit of the company is growing continuously.
The IBM password is to change everything, just not your values.
That's why it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History IBM: From the puddle of cheeses to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was created in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken up until 1924 - it was originally a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The basis for IBM's later merger was four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technology like the famous "snakes," that is, hours recording employees' income and departure.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired the head of Thomas J. Watson's competition company to help him run the company.
The leader then exposed the founders of IBM - in Watson's thinking, an invincible corporate culture and identity has been built so far.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from the bakers of meat and cheese after the store.
During the first four years of Watson’s business, he doubled his turnover to $9 million and began to expand the company’s expansion into all parts of the world.
Watson was so inconvenient to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson Junior, was expelled from the boss’s chair.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous year of man for the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "peecake" that developed the computer standard at the time, with the name IBM 5150, came into the market in 1981.
About 20 years later, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers Lenovo, on the other hand bought a consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to give full advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of smarter planets.
Its objective is to make smart use of technologies in the field of unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in urban transport or management.
For the area of trade, IBM has recently launched a Smarter Trade platform, which helps traders drive the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a research team at the world level dealing with the recognition of the voice.
A searcher for an unfaithful husband:
Iveto, leave the ass, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtāřová (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtār (53) became not only a protector of Ivety Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she's not ready to wait, and she's set clear rules for her next life.
"The Pope may return home, but not as my partner anymore," said the Knight.
When Darina Richtārová offered asylum to Bartoš in her home in the summer, she probably did not give up on the end of her marriage.
Although Iveta moved out of Greece after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
In Darina’s time process, she re-evaluated her husband’s relationship with her, and now she even gave him a good name.
The hunter doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If the Searcher and Bartos were to break up, he would not be waiting for his wife at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him away."
"But it is not like my beloved, misguided old donkey, but like a man with whom I have certain ties," Ristārová declared, saying that she had already given up her husband and lasted only for mutual obedience.
Joseph's closing Darina's back door is fine.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The husband has arranged a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I'm taking care of repair, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darino and I are totally normal, just because we don't share the beds together," said Bleska Searcher.
If she also finds a new love, she won't be able to defend it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph said.
The worst women's abuses: Do they concern you too?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female abuses, they all got into one very early out of the hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know in the following lines, where there are a number of women's abuses that can completely release blood in the veins to men?
Shopping
Does your second half tell you that you're dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one hat a week?
You're buying love and together in discounts?
Then, in your case, it's about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that their shopping passion should be at least a little tight.
But tell me, who would resist this just to go through the clothes shop, look for good falling ends and then try all of them (ideally in different color renderings) in the cabin?
Although for most women buying a horse, for men it can become literally a hell of a lot.
Just remember how many times you told your friend he'd rather wait for you in front of the entrance...
Unsatisfied
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't those words remind you of anything?
Is that right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but many men are just allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their views.
Stronger sex is also consistent with the increase in the frequency of this complaint, which makes women more disgruntled.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless roundabout.
Clears the windows, wipes, wipes the teeth, wipes the dust, draining the bathroom - and at least twice a week.
You're counting on your partner to slip a dirty foot on a clean fire, to the kids, to smack the drained toilet and tossed the damn living wall with which you've done so much work?
In case you're suffering just like this, try to realize that there's nothing to be overlooked and the order and purity should definitely not be within the family in the first place.
This unharmed desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship and family atmosphere.
Rape
"These used coaches put in the basket."
"Are you gonna take those old socks on you tomorrow too?"
"There's no wet breeze on the ground."
If you have a partner like this a few times a day, you know that you can handle him faithfully.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, but you want to make it all right.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have had to do so much shit again...
Apologizing, shaking
For some women, it's also their own conversations, jokes, and insults and sexing against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe every one of us is gonna get a little dirty bitch or a curse out there.
Hands on your heart, it's your own for all women.
On the other hand, the roots of the worst grain, which are usually sweet and often ripe, may turn everyone around and are particularly dangerous - especially within the framework of the female working group.
Jagr and Voraček helped with the victory assistance of Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the NHL's Monday match with two assistances for the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolin's ice and is again in the head of the production of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, a nine-year-old star who added one more recording and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jagr's partner Jab Voraček.
The Jagr, after beating the marine journalists, claimed that he predicted a big night for Giroux.
"I told him before the match, he's got a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel like it's going to get over," explained Jagr, whose action gave Giroux a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A second time later, he had a Czech lead team.
The Voraček fought behind the Hurricanes cat and presented it between the circles of Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
In particular, Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he shot a third goal, after which his shot was overrun in the fourth branch of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the best three," Jagr evaluated his center.
"I would never think that at the end of my career I'd be playing hockey as he is."
"I'm happy for that."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in the NHL my co-players tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Caroline from the game made a drama, Tuoma Routua's head and again Dwyer, who took advantage of the criminal shooting, got a difference between one branch.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who ordered the number two to one.
"He's done well in our Pronger band."
"He hit the cat, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a more distant point."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," described the final race from my own perspective.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
Czech defender Montreal Jaroslav Špatak did not win a match against Buffal, in the second third he resigned due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candys, along with the experienced beak, lost two-legged leadership and lost after the penalty shot 2:3.
One of their rides hasn't changed Tomás Plekanec.
More than lost points, the home coach hated a vast marodic rear row, with only five defenders playing the match.
"It's bad."
"We played the escape with only one experienced player, the rest were young men."
"But there's nothing to do with it in a short time, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We've been under control and we haven't been able to resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game more, put a crack out of our band."
We had gaps in it," one of P.K. Subban's defenders added.
The Czech rabbi Ondræj Pavelec contributed thirty powers to Winnipeg's 5:2 victory over Tampou Bay.
The jets that broke down the five-track series of probes were divided into five different shooters.
How entry prices have evolved since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Chedok, Sportist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the dry majority only trips to the socialist bloc country, as travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci na Krymu zu Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime joined the West and the Czech tourist routes to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not for the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also for the Czech Slovaks) to travel freely on an individual basis even within the socialist countries.
In case the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, it needed a letter calling from that country, otherwise it was not an individual journey possible.
Traveling offices at that time offered trips to the West, but there was a need to stand the front over the night with a pack or to have in the travel office "well known".
But it wasn't even saved.
The so-called foreign exchange clause, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people", who could not suffer at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, without a foreign currency pledge, so it was not possible to obtain funds (West currency) on the West road.
However, most of the Czechs spent their vacation abroad, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalaps that the Czechs have set up and this habit survives today.
Traveling the Czechs has been a real revolution since 1989.
While we were allowed our maximum in the NDR or Bulgaria by 1989, the Vultures spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that for us today, the most popular Croatia was not able to travel freely until 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Towards the end of the 90th century, visa requirement was abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria or Germany.
The Czechs could not afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech authorities burned in the parks in the states, as our current incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or pension.
The typical route of the Czechs was at this time driving their own food, cans, salads, etc. to save it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely interchangeable Czech crowns, which, after many decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and the average payments, however, have come to an end around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of increased travel demand, travel officials have regularly started to prepare charter flights since 1997 and flight tickets have proved to be incredibly low as compared with the past.
By the end of the 90th century, Czechs had already had virtually no link to all the developed countries of the world, except for the United States, which continued to ease our journey.
Another interesting moment in the history of the evolutionary journey occurred in the year 2000, when thanks to a considerable demand from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter flight to the exotic, was to Thailand.
Since this year, Czech tourists have been flying direct charters to warm distant countries each year, this year the winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100 thousand Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our evolution, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished a visa for Czech tourists and thus our country definitely joined the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign leave (50.3%) and the first in history spent one foreign leave including the cost of staying more than 15,000 CZK per person.
The Valna assembly is to find the president, but again threatens the pat
Nearly five months is Czech football without the president and threatens that the successor Ivan Haška in front of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not even know after another extraordinary event that will take place Thursday in Nymburc.
However, there is still no agreement under which the rules of procedure will be taken.
Without it, no vote will begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading the Czech football has Jindřich Rachel, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and, at his departure, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead to football in the future.
However, in the era after the Haškov football closed back to the track between the two bond chambers, which cannot be matched on the joint candidate.
It was fully shown on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates gathered at the National House in Prague on the Smíchov extravagance, because the conversation was blocked and it was not just about the way of the election.
There was no agreement, therefore, on who has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives, or even trustees full of power.
In this single point since then, a partial agreement has been established, which has also helped to recommend the Constitution for a state and law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, there is still debate on the electoral order.
Too clear to the situation, even the executive committee, which, in its discussions, whether right or wrong, does not essentially solve anything else.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neurologic point is still the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the 3rd cycle to exclude the possibility of a pat?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," one of the three Vice-Chairmen of FAČR Dušan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the terms of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate wins, which will have more percentage support in the chamber than he is running for.
It is supposed to be willing to go to the election to win the candidate, who receives a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the weight of this percentage.
"But then it would miss the meaning of the two previous wheels, it would completely contradict the two-legged concept," grasps the opposition of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to move and choose according to the current positions.
This is a bit of a surprise that even Tomáš Paklík, although it is estimated that the rulings are based on the rule of choice from all the candidates most of Pelt.
"I'm hoping it'll go up to the top of the flats."
"In order not to think of any reprehensible nonsense as in the past," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first running and in his statements he was first opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburg, according to him, the new president will know and believe that candidates will work constructively in the future.
"All of us will be truly calming the possible process of today's national team on Europe's championship."
"The football will be on a happy volleyball again, it will be more willing to cooperate," my apple maker, who has three of the biggest experiences with football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very disbanded."
"It's not between Czech and Moravian people, but there are efforts to adapt the rules."
"This can cause the walnut to be blocked again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's no time left for all parties to make a deal.
Some of the events were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, only who would be the complete football generality in the match.
The aircraft special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, other than Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rachel, did not fly out from Prague in the morning due to technical disruption and sought a replacement option as part of the executive committee's mission to the event of the barage takeoff.
Finally, there may be a decision-making meeting at the ministerial level, which can be reportedly in the middle.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to get the disbanded parties inside the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot of this in the game: state grants, football reliability and also a valuable crowd of CSTVs, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazky.
The package is fighting for the president because it does not see an appropriate candidate.
If the leader of Plzno Paklík had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary Vale Assembly, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) and would not have joined in the struggle for the ultimate function.
"If there's a quality adept, I'm fighting for it and I'm not going to make a choice."
"But in the current situation, no one could find such a person," CTK Paklík said.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelto and Jindřich Rachel's wife Pacík's motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favorite choice, in the way to FAČR.
The Panel also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he would only stand in the role of the president until 2013, when there is a proper wave of events on the programme.
In function, he would like to see an experienced and peak manager, who is not too involved with football.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that they didn't even want to identify with the Czech football right now."
"I would like to change such a view," he said.
Paklíkovi is now the most prominent figure in Pelt's connection with the President of the Plzeńska National Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial history, who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates on a volleyball assembly.
It's so unacceptable for Paklika that Pelta is in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is being served, and nothing in the football would move forward."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a capable merchant, it would not make the football even more successful," said Paklík.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was recorded in the envoys during the investigation of the corruption affair, but Pelta left without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's football victory would bring."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who is also taking care of his former sentence that he would "sold a plzen club if Pelta became president".
If Paklík triumphed in the fourth election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelt.
He also considers another Rachel candidate, whom Paklík supported in front of a shooting wave that ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"I have great abilities."
"I'd like to introduce him as the head of the representation."
"But managers wouldn't be able to run an association."
"I also don't lose my nose where I can't," said Paklík, who, in September, raised a great deal of attention by standing behind the decision-makers' committee in front of Mr. Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
The hell he claims to be a troufl for the leadership of the association.
He is referring to his ability to run private companies, and since last year he has also led the Plzni, who, with his support in May, celebrated the premiere league triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the impact of some interest groups, which need to have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to unwarranted situations," said Paklík, who is not hiding their antipathy, for example, with the chief of the state of Spartan, Daniel Kretínski.
One of the priorities would also consider the suspension of FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax in the political spheres.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be committed to."
"If gambling is being taxed, as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to say where the money goes," he noted.
As a consequence now, Paclík does not even take his connection to the Plenary Club, claiming himself that the President of FAČR should be "foreign".
Pelta's connected again with Jablon, Rachel with the Prague Duckle.
"It's not perfect."
"But I can't see the point of converting my actions to someone's cover in the Plenary Club, and for a year and a half, he came back there," Paklík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR positions that would exclude the election path
Two days ago, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of an election, the FAČR would have new positions that would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonian official is an optimist in Nymburce before the fourth reading and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly disable the possible success of the football representation today.
Pelta had already promised before the election in September that it was intended to focus on the representation and acquisition of finance in the case of an election.
He decided to go for the last minute before the election, and then a two-month delay could be put on him to discuss his ideas about football management and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been making football for a long time and expect the president to know on Thursday."
"It feels that it is the best time for an association to lead," my husband, who is primarily associated with the apple club, but who has been working for several years in Sparta and the executive board of the bond.
And that's why he's supposed to have enough experience to drive a Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are euphoria, which prevailed during the reign of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, in the June Vale Assembly, there were approved states that were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had the president since September," Pelta said.
The process of recasting the most important document of the civil society has been passed on to delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to assume personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a fundamental thing we can't be without," says Pelt.
He's trying not to get out against his rivals.
He had previously warned that he could be able to work with Jindřich Rachel, who he recognizes for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He hasn't even attacked Tomás Pacík for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave a dry spot on Pelt.
"Something moves in football over the year, has already achieved some success."
"But his attacks were invincible and a lot of people in the way of election campaigns jumped."
"That's why a number of them now doubt his real character," said the opponent's address Pelt, who remains a faithful proclaimer who announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competition until after the representation.
This should be a football show.
"And I would also try to put an end to all the affair begins with the cause of Bohemians or the sound of a previous corruption scandal."
"Now I would like to engage with the private and state sectors to ensure that we have enough money for the whole football," the CTC said, a 16-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the front of the football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I would first have to meet with the full number of individual employees," he pointed out to Fear, where from the long ruleless rule there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are taking place, they believe that on Thursday delegates will not go to Nymburk for the rest of the day.
"If it's the only controversial point of how to choose in the third round, then we can move through it."
"The football needs confidentiality, and it only gets here by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains two days ago, perhaps deciding on the day of her career as an optimist.
Rachel promises that under it FAČR would start working hard
If the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association had been elected to the fourth round of elections, today's Vice-President Jindřich Reichl, many people in the association would not have enjoyed it.
Rachel promises that in his election, he will start working hard.
He wants to propose systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue in the work that former President Ivan Hasek started.
"As president, I'd like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, youth performance football."
"But I'm not saying that I'd do everything on my own," said Rachel in a conversation for the CTB.
"I am a team player, and I want to divide the competence within the executive committee so that each member will be dedicated to certain areas."
"And I'm going to give hard tasks to push the football forward in each of this segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start to work really hard and not just criticise the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he wouldn't run again.
"I know I've been doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will always throw their fists under my feet and question every step of my life," he explained.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up because then they would give up."
"It's a trust I can't just throw," he said.
It also motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes launched that will be heard within a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that in the event of another candidate Miroslav Pelty's election, the situation on the bond could be returned to the time before Haske.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing that I don't think Mirek Pelta can."
"There are, above all, binding people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can count a lot of things, but it's certainly not that I'm a stranger."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then they'll all be well and not just your election," said Rachel.
Deviation and claim that he would only be the Czech President.
"Even if some people are trying to argue otherwise, I'm going to do the maximum for Moravian."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where only three Moravian communities are in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
Since he also took part in the fight for the president and the head of the Tomáš Paklík Plík Plík Club, Rachel will not be able to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice-president and sees that I have clear success," said Rachel, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiation of lottery law.
On the contrary, he thinks that the bond does not attract one race.
While Pelt states that he is "disqualified from returning to the Czech football of trust", the second of Paklíka's competitors considers him a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt he's done a great job in Plz this year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not have changed his personal presence in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for his own good," the rival's evaluation of Rachel.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
From the view of Ufona, a wellness pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or travel let his tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book shows where wellness is at the water's most beautiful.
When Iris Meder was released in the last one and a half years on the open road, she shouldn't have been missing in her purse: her swimsuits.
Standing on the water, she looked into the height of the articulated dome, swam across the marble road (putting a little naked boy, child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and looked at carefully restored dry vessels.
If some sailor liked her, she took her mother into her bookstore with remarkable details about how to build and the history of the building.
More than 200 sailors examined in this way the historical architecture of Meder and now presents them in their recently published book "Badefreuden (Radost of bathing) ": People's navigations in Munich, the historic palace of navigation in Schwarzwald", the hard core of concrete buildings in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Way to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a truly enthusiastic floating culture.
With sport it doesn't go too far, says Meder - only in water it's something else.
The only thing to do with the relationship is that the fans' swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the healthy runners can breathe the humid smell of the pine forests or listen to the happy glowing birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the sailor must always be so shy," says Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"That's how I started to collect nice vessels."
Water level doubles architecture
Swim in the Scotch pool and essential oil for the sauna - the factor of the weather is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders have tried, the sailors can be a real eyebrow: "The place of the floor is a man in a pool of water."
"It's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
It's all optically duplicated: high cloning, thick tiles, jumpscrew.
The Maloformatic image link "Badfreuden (Badfreuden from the bath)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but in particular the taste of jumping into the blue.
The remarkable specimens revealed Mrs. Meder's collection of sailors during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spas, like 100 years of old Széchenyi spas in Budapest, she found water with the contents of the original beautiful cave (the famous spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal spa, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle (Várasios Termámáfürdö in Jászberén).
On the contrary, they offer many heated vessels under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. As long as a person has from the Curry’s roof bath in the whole city, in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can be seen on the snow covered Arlberg - and: In the pair of spas there is a window from which you can watch the movement on the ski resort.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the swimming pool is expected by guests in Langenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the top three of the open lords in the winter, a few climbs to the sky in the background of the mountain of Ötztal.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not every sailor's pool collector, Mrs. Meder, came up with a chlorine scent.
Many thermal spas are feeling after cheese, in the spas of Arpád in Hungary’s Békessaba, it smells after a hot oil to the extent that a person hardly believes that he has reached the treatment spas.
The tail comes from therapeutic water with alkali hydrocarbons, which is almost black and its plants immerse themselves in the skin as soon as a person enters the pool - some special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioned spa Luhačovici, she came to the closed area.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovic was designed to close the bathroom.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the breaking windows of the red-white-yellow secession buildings, she saw how the crowd might grow between the curtains.
On the contrary, the sun was built in a magical yard in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; a person can discover not only the New Romanian elements that come from the time of his creation in 1844, but also the Maurice Blue in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite spa resort of the swimming pools of Mrs. Iris Meder, not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some power to connect so diverse construction structures to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace there is a subjugation in the thermal pool, apparently a territorial matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank leave its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor.
Then in January, the boss of the group wants to draw the results out.
Hamburg -
For the population, the point is clear: 84% of the Germans, according to one study, find it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey from the credentials of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows by the author Harald Schumann that the stakes at the global comedy fairs are causing prices to rise and the banks are therefore bringing together on a global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, comedy bets were intended to ensure that traders would be able to avoid price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that participants in the capital market, with the interest of high-risk trades, have withdrawn from supply and demand - and have gained profits on account of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he reacted to Ackermann's criticism: he promised that the stamps were checking and said that no trade "is not worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank in bet".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Foodwatch-Report Task Force is controlled.
By the end of the year, the check will be closed and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank - together with the recommendation to be made.
Then, at the end of January, the bank representatives want to tell us what the consequences are.
Finally, there could be a reduction in trade in commodities or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works by himself on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The rise in food prices is particularly drastic as banks today are harming the general good."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, be given responsibilities.
"Deutsche Bank must tighten all the items in its portfolio that use money for food bills," Bode said.
"Shortly, Mr. Ackermann is about the hunger of suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the delegation would not go to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And the potential loss must not be taken into account - it should be the end of his successor.
Anyone else would say the raw material investment
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have been involved in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey asking 1001 people at the Institute of Forsa on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, only eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank is offering investments that are linked to food prices.
Many customers would also draw on the personal consequences if they learned that their bank is engaged in such transactions: Each other would, as a result of the survey, report all the investments in which the money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 per cent would warn the bank, 49 per cent said that he was thinking about answering his account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Russian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 was awarded prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern military architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold lighting and new construction materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an outstanding and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and highly functional structure of steel and glass.
The building is still a milestone of modern architecture.
He praised the architect so that he built the Pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
At the end of 1973, with its legendary four-walled BMW-palat plus as the key to the next building in Munich, he was internationally celebrated.
His temporary exhibition building, which was designed after the world exhibition, was located in Schweizer Garten at the Viennese Südbahnhof (South Station), rebuilt and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But suitable for the museum building was not, both spatially and technically, missing walls to hang artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art had reached a new stage in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been increasingly chatting.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon has rebuilt, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere will open the first exhibition, which includes the palace - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco was held in 2007, which became the new director of the Belvedere Museum of Austria.
Husslein-Arco, a leading historical art with a significant career, including in a young beauty store, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum, and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has greatly improved the reconstruction of politics and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the associate Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited with the same hope, the coffee shop and the bookstore should be created, and the office building must be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was an ideal obsession.
Not only did he rebuild and expand the secessional buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because Schwanzer studied at the Technical University of Vienna and Pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where "most every weekend" he attended the exhibition.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which, when he moved to Vienna and changed the use of it, had lost its prosperity and ease.
At the present reconstruction there were far more problems: the building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facades were replaced, used by glass fibres, the glass insulation glass and the glass roof were replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled roofs were healed.
Two underground floors provided a space for new use, an abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads to the bridge - almost a new building, but still the tower of Schwanzer.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is built in an old anti-corrosive red tones.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And it's all under the strict supervision of the memory office and the low budget.
"It often had to be found material that was good and cheap and also liked the memory office," Krischanitz says and points to the collapse of the basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems, and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficult thing was with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels", recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "be appropriate self-conscious".
In this case, however, it is not the House of the 21st century in an insatiable place, because urbanist happy coincidences have occurred: A completely newly designed "City district at the Main Station" has been created around Schweizer Garten with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy occasion: The house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanit's building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporère Kunshalle and, as you can hear it, already has one with the city of the neighbourhood in the settlement in Schweizer Garten.
Road is planning a package for the winter crisis in the millions
The road was a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against cold train accidents and delay, Deutsche Bahn publishes more than 70 million euros in news reports this year.
The "Build" news reported in advance with a call for an internal group plan, that it is estimated at around EUR 300 million with investments in 2015.
It is designed to achieve better use of trains and rail networks under extreme weather conditions as well.
It is planned, inter alia, to double the number of internal and external workers per 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and fittings.
The aim is to avoid the entry point for operation and 90% for operation of the necessary displacements during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Dr. Rüdiger Grube warned at the highest level of meeting with the government and industry before train accidents and delays also during the winter.
In the last winter, there were significant problems in personal transport, since, among other things, there was a lack of reserve under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Spolkov Railway Authority.
In addition, delays in the operation of ICE trains
The route has not been able to do so for years, and it is likely that ICE trains will have to be kept track of more closely when one of the ICE trains arrived at the Cologne main station to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the United States
After a break around Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is a new highway in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, it was still in the field of his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million in one balancing operation (106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
NCUA’s financial market regulator calculates a number of large banks, that the cooperative banks have made false promises to buy financial products; that the risks have been reduced.
Such papers have been lost during the crisis significantly on value and have thrown the banks with them into ruin.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the issue without the need for parties to intervene in court," spokesperson Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt when it's settled.
It also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get a refund for the damage caused by billions.
Now the final equations are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks and in the summer he complained about JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the questionable mortgage lists, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble collapsed around the property in 2007, it became a number of financial companies doomed.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the incident occurred a few years ago, the strong wind is now blowing the banks in the background.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed a number of complaints in order to achieve corrections or raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) dropped the biggest wave of complaints.
It is clear to 18 international large banks that two state-owned US financiers dealing with the properties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in transactions with mortgages amounting to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which is about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses " without, however, giving any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests potentially in IBM IT.
Since March, he bought a stock worth more than $10 billion.
So far, a significant American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers, as long-term company development is only expected with difficulties.
However, he now read IBM's commercial reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand a long time ago that IBM is offering services in particular and has installed computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Bufftta's investment in the financial world is set to fit in the knights.
As a result, it may be called the mother's horn IT IBM now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has produced at the CNBC's American economic announcement station that since March, he has purchased an IBM stock worth $10.7 billion.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management that was trying to achieve even the right results for the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been able to use the luxury IT services, such as the operation of the computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer advance also offers software and advice and efficient computers for companies.
Buffett with technology companies has been avoiding more than today.
He claims to invest only in businesses whose activities are also understood.
Instead, Buffett sat down after the freighter, after the maszil manufacturer, or after the production of machinery.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries also shared in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Ret.
Mr. 81-year-old took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built with it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
That's why it's a cultural attitude for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha's Orakel (Omaha's Azazak).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock was raised by one percent before the start of the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion in stock exchange and is placed with Apple and Microsoft companies for the world's most valuable technology business.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to perform.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The risk is substantial
After the discovery of "Bunňky in Zwickau", the Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
The news even speaks of "blood ideology", which is now alive again.
The killings of eight small Turkish-born entrepreneurs and of one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legally extremist background.
In Turkey and within Germany, the German-Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and anxiety.
For many of the German Turks, this brings back the horror that has long been claimed dead: From the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
There was no doubt about this in Germany.
However, the legal extremistic network is revealing the extent to which it has long been unable to observe.
"Reliving Bloody Ideologies Again?" were the titles of the online edition of Turkish news "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the news "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical church.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with a strong response: It recalled the weekend demonstration of silence in front of the Brandeburg War of Racism Victims.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, recalled the act of celebration of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, a common life was enhanced - like a success story.
As a policing here, several Turkish media reports: "Darek Germany to the '50s" is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany is not allowed to take place to prevent this thinking connection.
"It's starting to smell," sounds like the column title of Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights that people who paid taxes and their work were murdered and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical thing is to discuss in the German Internet Forums the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why the German authorities have not come up with a long time ago to be admired by the author after suspected patrols in the right extremistic circles.
Thus many are taking place at least rhetorically ready to use the drastic means: "If the activity is continued here so superficially, it will not prevent immigrants from doing anything other than their own defence and arms".
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of explanation and the suitability of the whole network depends very heavily on the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
Which means, if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of Solingen's bedroom is deeply rooted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown here to the Turks more clearly that there is a material threat here and to the Germans that mistrust and deviation can lead to legal violence
However, the assassinations made Turkey's side more sensitive to each other's feelings.
Do Not Repeat Errors of the Past
The Turkish press then criticised the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those who survived in Mölln.
After a fire attack in Solingen, he sent a co-sponsored telegram to the Turkish President, but in Cologne, he had his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees Turkey had paid.
It's just as if the value of a person is measured according to the height of his taxes.
The current news of Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the present state-law arrangement.
In addition to the extensive explanation and new assessment of the right of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
The scandalous bank at the Curyš Lake
The most favourable bank of Europe has no home in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then is from one crisis to the next.
Now a German has to compare it.
Then Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his sound departure from the lead of the Spolk Bank, it became known in July that 2013 will take place in almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank - an unexpected and luctative step in the career.
Axel Weber was happy in the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new strength and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS reached the scene."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One dealer from UBS in London hanged all the bank's security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS representation Oswald Grübel, not only a recognised banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board of Directors is also as well as armed since then - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that the Weber bank has been allowed to work since February 2012.
And we will take over the Presidency of the Governing Council in May - not only in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and a banker, and he'd probably need time to work.
We will then assume responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which has once again proved that it deserves the title "The Bank of Europe's biggest scandals"
Because UBS, however, is huge - until recently, has been the world's largest asset manager - and more recently after years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank saved.
It started with a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid, but also of the smart owner of the property is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in the investment banking industry.
Thus, UBS adjusted 2007 to one side with $1.6 billion more money from potential customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has become an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made sense.
The former banker and later long-term bank professor in Curychu Hans Geiger will say, "I've always given UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, man asks, "How could I have been wrong?"
He was wrong.
It was first apparent in 2007 that something in the UBS had turned out to be correct.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who had been appointed as a highly intelligent and also a genius banker, was surprised.
A few months later, he was wondering why he left.
The investment division of the bank blew subprime-papers and had to save billions.
To stop it, UBS has announced an increase in capital of really 13 billion francs.
That is why it is true that investors have been found, however, such as those that they would have recently covered their nose: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that no one knew their name.
But it was just the first shot.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to admit the new billions of losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Opel, 2006 the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, has resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS became in view of its poor investment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank has bought out UBS for tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for a mandatory variable bond, which could have been a co-founder of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is the second one.
For several months, UBS has been capitalizing on the tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to issue data to potential customers who, as far as possible, have cut taxes.
She also agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on unauthorized profits from these transactions, including bribes.
This led to more or less open UBS being able to help with tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that had been the life of her capital in the competition for rich customers: a sanatorium of discretion.
After this scandal, there was no Swiss banking secret any more than it was before.
The position of the head of the delegation and of the President of the Governing Council followed.
And the exodus of customers' money.
The bank thus lost its credibility in both central trading areas over the course of several months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of property to help tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS was back on track, this unfortunate commercial anabasm came in here: the only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it probably still doesn't care.
"Abololi's case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance Professor of Finance at the Zürich University Bank Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not manage risk control."
However, that was exactly the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had come up with long ago to become the guardians of the world's big assets: no too high a risk, so security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic has increased the world again.
Swiss banks' vaults have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is even more suitable for good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
It's already classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyš Lake, which is trapped by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental of shops is the highest in Europe.
Clothing like Tiffany's is found here among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli sugar.
The Swiss banks have been established for centuries: from the National Bank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private bank like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entering difficult turning doors.
Inside there are walls covered with marble, there are possible leather chairs in front of them, next to the bank's window, a big direction to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss Banks, both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, has sometimes, however, been suppressed or betrayed by the head of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the papers, eventually closing up like all Swiss bankers, as well as both large banks.
UBS has probably increased too much, it finds out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Sailed have expanded.
The Swiss probably don't have anything to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have contributed to the Anglo-Saxon Ways long ago."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, led to a high profit and then a loss: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"On Wednesday, the government coalitions of the small seven million countries fell to the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to protect against the bankruptcy of a large bank.
How could that happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a potential group.
A bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
It also helped to complement the two different bank predecessors of UBS: One rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich with a life in property and poorer management, but internationally more heavily involved.
Here, internationalised investment bankers have come in favour of a lot of money that could be used to spread a large roulette.
With this UBS rise, two names are linked: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS and Marcel Opel Group, then the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Opel were a team of futures," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Opel, a person who is in charge of the stomach that has been fully developed from banking science."
But Opel's been relying on Wuffli until the end.
And Wuffli probably finally allowed himself to make decisive mistakes: "I guess he thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, there was a fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of the leading workers, on which the Group Chief Wuffli repeated the same password again: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The U.S. bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
"League Tables," a series that records the success of the bank at the time.
She was trying to put UBS on top of it.
A few steps have already happened to her.
In the exchange of currencies and shares, the games were fully involved.
Business advisors, who were entrusted, however, stress one weakness: In international interest trading, in the words of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, the UBS decided on an adventure that had almost become its existence.
Cold by growth, the bank itself invested as well as its risk-based fund in the US Subprime investment.
She developed into a powerful machine that converted valuable papers into American mortgage loans and passed on - but she also kept the risk itself.
Even when the other banks were looking for the east.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS was buying," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep down.
One manager after the other had to leave, when the attempts to clean up were harder than it thought.
UBS positions have become a catapulting seat, and so far they've been hooped.
Who's running the big bank now has almost impossible work.
They have to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End of investment banking, concentration in property management, return to Swiss roots.
That's how far the bank still doesn't want to go.
But investment banking is going to kill so hard, it's so clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood as only a transitional solution when the bank suddenly split up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he went on to say, "It's a long time to run UBS's business, the curry bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money for?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already handling.
Publicly, however, she's just saying that she's going to find her lady's apartment in Zurich in the first place.
Next year.

The legend of Warren Buffett's investment just confirmed this view: In one CNBC interview, he said it would not be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too soon to invest in European government loans or banks.

Smart Gates Expanding in Cities
In many places there are stored harrans full of "problem birds": However, from the city long ago, these highly intelligent animals cannot be released, hard experts say.
One of them likes to be friends would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The gates already belong to the image of the city after centuries, although in some villages the people gather complaints about uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no way against the "problem birds" in the field of surveillance.
The Havranes are probably not able to get out of the city anymore, the experts have declared the first impression of the gates in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the community consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature defenders, however, also removed the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected farms: The use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to destroy the traditional areas for life.
Tracking, growing construction and planting typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
The holes are protected.
A large colony with more than 600 nesting couples are, among other things, in Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bré and Leer.
There, he launched 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the rural period of a negative title.
Critics have marked the capture of animals into pastures for birds and the killing of claws in particular brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," found so many urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by cutting water or planting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the great colony is plowing and splitting into other places."
Fear is only considered an exception in hospitals, infirms or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them anymore."
Without the surrounding area, there was no problem in the city, the opinion of ancient Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is thought that the combination of animal expulsions from sensitive residential areas and their attachment to settle in other places.
"The information table instead of chain-pillars" promoted Uta Maria Jürgens' psychologist and ethnoologist for a completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can finally be the best thing to stay conscious."
Ms. Jürgens joined Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scientific feedback path, on which they provide an information table on the life of a highly intelligent, full-blown haven.
The project is in the meantime to accept tourists.
Also at the criticism of the noise caused by the bird, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Havrani fills not only with help to reach Pamlia, but even as a help, he will make his tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of the four whales of the pollinators as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that the stones must bring the cutting of the structure to the larvae.
Without great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to make a collapse of the surface.
In the second attempt, the wounded crows had to solve a more brilliant problem.
In all the war that was set up, the researchers placed a small supply of larvae.
The birds could not reach their advantage by sight.
The researchers, however, put a piece of the wire in there.
Of these, all four of them made hooks, using them as a smoker from the tube of a container.
Three of the four full harbors did it even with a stake.

On the other hand, Stark carried out a controversial criminal coup following the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the European Vice-President of 2004 explained everything with four trephams.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended up in 81 minutes as well as the last doubts.
This leaves Europe's champion from 1976 to the fifth in a row to the European Championship.
Coach Michael Bilka and Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1.F.F. Norimberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.

Damjanovic fired at 40 minutes from the border of the criminal territory just right around the Czech branch.
After the break, it had to be easy to save the place of the already wounded Czech world class, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The branch just before the end finally explained everything.

Massacre at personal level
Emotionally strong new book by Peter Engunda, entitled Beauty and the Sorow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of emerging figures that you will find out.
One advice on how to keep this page: Carefully pull out this page and make it a tray.
With all the people you will get to know Mr. Englund very well and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a Mayan - at times when you will feel as much confused and lost as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new job at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite politely, as "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it almost lacks evangelists, energetic journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not as much a book as a book about what happened, it explains the author as more "the book about what it was." It deals mainly with "senses, feelings, experiences and moods".
"Beautiful and condolences" combines the war experience of 20 more less tactical men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to after the horoscope, doctors, rescue driver and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, end up insane, or die.
Their lives are like flames of candles burned in the church - new ones are added to the coincidence of fate while others are thrown away.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classical historical novels.
He's correcting the idea that the first world war was just a horrific war on the West Front.
"Beautiful and condolences" is handy to explore other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems by falling on their nests, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or dealing with the presence of the tse-tse flies.
It's almost the beginning of a very interesting reading.
The war will kill people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, breathing with gunfire.
When the shooting starts in the distance and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the entire war was fought.
"Vakuum caused by lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with ghosts, suspicions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fammes."
"Breath and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories have been taken over from biographies, letters, and other material that has already been published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and deceptive, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and reliable.
Many of them agree on the struggle and reconciliation with him.
In the story of the German student, the author says, "Refunds, all over the place."
"The backdrop of the coffee, the similarity of the aluminum, the imitation of the rubber, the paper envelopes, the wooden buttons."
He's still going on and describing food substitutes in Germany.
It is referred to "mass made of liquefied rice cooked in spoof fat (and added to the fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, botanical bottles".
It refers to that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about dignity and mightiness.
One American finds himself in the inner flood of savagery and brutality, which declares the principle of war: "You will finally understand that this is human nature. Never sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind this scratched me there is no barbaric behind it."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest probability he will soon die, and no one will ever notice it, just to grieve.
"If a person finally turns to being sacrificed, he would at least wait for it to happen before the eyes of a grateful audience," he writes.
But instead, it seems like a "criminal who secretly hangs him."
Further notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new threats.
"The more conflict became an economic competition and a competitive fight," says Mr. Englund, "the war between factories."
He caught what he says "the new kind of creature of the coming century: an expressive and ideologically committed mass murder in a dress cut to the peace that his bloodshed carries out without getting up from the table."
People behave totally unexpected, subjugated with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexually transmitted disease to avoid the service on the front.
"The most important example of this behaviour was the trade with gonococcal gear that soldiers bought and stole from them in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," she writes.
"The most ferocious of them have even cast him into the eye, which has often blinded him to the end of life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Gravese, Mr. Engleunda's exclusiveness, but it does not show anything, which fits his human theme perfectly.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which the war has "resolved completely insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders have to fight.
The best books on the first world war mostly worked with signs, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or the Romans as "On the West Front Peace" by Erich Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most disturbing marriage that there are no periods in popular scientific literature.
But I won't betray him to you.
But you'll look like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled out a page from the list of heroes out of his hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute exactly planned time
Hundreds of policemen took part, some in the traps used in street riots.
Monday night on Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except for a number of high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that it was a practice.
In front of the event, police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
Cases in the last few weeks should not be repeated, for example, when the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators was used, which violated the rules of the department and, in addition, the free sympathy of the public was transferred to the side of the squatters.
That was why a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders allowed themselves to be inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercise for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders reinforced the so-called peace suppression training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of policemen - with a focus on the city part Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last moment" by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "practice".
"I know a few policemen who were also invited to this event, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on the condition that he would remain anonymous.
"The fact that he was going to Zuccotti Park only knew the highest position of the department."
One reason for hiding was a lesson that the city had already received.
On 14 October, the city representatives in the park plan had to clean up, but then they withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they moved to the park before the start of the operation.
The internal actions were attended by police officers from various units, including stakeholders from all over - dozens of police officers who are usually used to strengthen the quarter with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day in the park, there's a large number of people leaving, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start action.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there will be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the units expressed themselves, they set out on the street of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, freight vehicles of emergency units with cloud lamps and amplion.
The light and the recorded message from the amps of many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
The police say that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't touch a single apartment, which she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things up.
Other police teams were watched as they gathered at the park's edge so that they could enter it if there was a need to make a stop.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson of the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed it was so safe for them.
Many reporters, however, hold the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and that some policemen were also rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on the Church Street leading along the western border of the park could film without problems.
The police took the western direction and launched a thick set of personal protesting items, including lockers and Igelite bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygienic department, who immediately took away everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park.
The most vulnerable group of demonstrators moved to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some of them created a spell, and the police started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of emergency services were invited to cross the locks.
Until 3:30 in the morning there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, it sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place for the reason "organisation of tension and arrest resistance," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also participated in Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives at the Department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in operating," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street Street, a block south of the park, were struck with tarasses.
From these places, the police have developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, policemen, many of whom were armed with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most savage events of the night went south from the park.
About five o'clock in the morning one protestor was seen south of Pine Street, as he jumped out on the police car cap, and several others who fired air from the pneumatic police supply.
At one point, a piece of a scroll flew out of the dove.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant were hospitalized.
The Association of Assistant Workers will sue the city for their release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants, who came to work last month, are planning to appeal to the city on Wednesday. They claim that leave was not necessary and also it was discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 committees in their efforts to reverse the decision to leave.
On 7 October, six seven hundred and two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees lost their jobs among the city's highest paying staff. Their resignations were described by the city's leading committee as a payout for not being able to access the health care fund managed by staff members last year, through which the city wanted to get a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives categorically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the Council's members was immediately concerned that the budget did not specifically address the release of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue her. On Wednesday, they allow the press conference, where they formally announced the complaint at the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be indicted in the process, while the complaining party will have eight employees, all of whom are African or Spanish, as well as most of the other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the law department of the city, said that the city had not yet seen the complaint, and that is why he would not speak to the individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times had been able to obtain, the committees focused on the number of people left in poor parts of the city who wanted to support their claim of unfair conduct. Thus, they maintain the view that poor schools have become more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient financial resources.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island part did not go away at all and only at least in the Upper East Side part, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 in Brownsville, there were 17 school assistants and in the District 8 and 9 parts of the South Bronx there were even 46 assistants.
He recalls that in the school of Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68 per cent of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not a neighborhood of full speech parents who can raise funds to balance the budget deficit."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and the school also paid money when the city changed its way of calculating bonus finance for every registered poor student.
In addition, the Committees claim that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which a document approving the release of parent coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, so to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the teacher's movement from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are played by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators have been released," the complaint suggests, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is at the end, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something regarding the rise in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time, the dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and the United States unit's participation ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should thank the Libyans for their successful rise to the American units for "statistics".
"By this statement, we want to assess the courage of the Libyans who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above words may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy so far.
During the years, the legislators on both sides have consistently agreed with the White House on the amendment of a series of declarations to approve or reject the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced resolutions allowing limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Shadow because of the different opinions of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the 10th day when this proposal was rejected in November, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission in Libya was literally in legislative clearance - Congress criticised the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members clearly did not interfere with it so much that they stopped supporting him in his work.
The importance of the convention finally preceded other events.
The rebels in August won Tripoli, and on October 20 he was killed by Kaddafi.
The mission then officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations, in its statement, "happily congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and amazing generosity, which they have shown in their efforts to free their people" and "honor men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary stability and professionalism."
The declaration also states that "the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya is confirmed."
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be once again divided into two-halfs, as was the case with the adoption of the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Chief Representative of the Republican Party to the Commission, has been set up.
Lugar's speech on Monday said he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
In November this week, there will be a vote on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole of November or Senate.
The other legislators, however, have not yet made a significant effort to push their proposals to the vote on their own.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were presented at the congress and affected wide ranges of different themes.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted by the Shadows and the Senate - and others are only minor exchanges of others.
Only at least 15 versions of the balanced budget add-ons and other items can be found in Snowford, which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are similar, but their supporters - especially the starters of Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can be fooled by their "authority".
The proposal for a budget regulation, which was approved in August, required that Snowmow and the Senate vote on an addendum to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an unconditional declaration to support the creation of such a supplement.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the number of periods in which members could serve the Congress, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in the office of President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would also guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The long-term proposal remains an addition banning the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition banning the burning of the flag of the State.
Some legislators also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws in the event that two thirds of the States are set up against them.
Although it seems that Congress members are very active in designing various supplements, compared with the previous years, however, they do not explicitly evict from the average.
At 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while at 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activities are even pale in comparison with the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate libraries offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The last addition added - 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Clouded, but not defeated," says Gifford in his first television interview from the shooting
Ten months after the shooting at the public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on the national television on Monday night, she sang along with a melody from the Broadway Show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than going back to Congress is about healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the production of seeds still makes her trouble and needed help as she walked.
The whole series documented her difficulty in reconvalence, which was necessary for the damage caused by a bullet that had pierced her skull in front of her, penetrated her left half of the brain and left her head out.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to Snowwood to participate triumphantly in the voting on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview from the cold shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described his refurbishment as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she replied to one-four years of Gifford's, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour specialist in the "20/20" series, which was released in the evening of the release of this new book, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special followed the entire Gifford Reconvalence since the 8th January shooting.
On the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, it's like seeing Giffords in a hospital bed with a hairy head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords was arrested, sitting in a wheelchair and being taught her how to do simple activities.
Keeping your head down.
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she needed changes in her breakfast.
The video released by the ABC station shows that the difficult role for the refurbishing of Gifford's music: Congressman sings them together with the therapist on the song "Girls Just Wana Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer found that from the day he got shot, he didn't remember anything.
Her husband said that the Giffords read news articles about the shooting until 12 March, when she first asked him who was the sixth woman who was killed at the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of the violent drugs he is awaiting trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Morning, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer found out that at one point his wife said during the reconvalence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got a load.
But you can do it, you can do it together, and you'll be back stronger than ever."
Military units meet more with compassion than with respect
This event was a gala dinner on Wall Street, which cost millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors were around him.
A gloriously dressed crowd rose up and cried out joyfully.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged the spring benefits.
In addition to this, the chairman of the headquarters committee was also admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units in a different way.
"All were represented as being orphaned," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
It was just what I saw, it wasn't respect.
Thus, the opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often balanced, sometimes praising the American public.
The army is quickly included with praise for its victims.
But these praise stands for something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like an individual in uniform regrettably.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the units in Iraq and would soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to make us a part of the unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or show their relations with the public whom they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are found in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat operations, where they served as members of the seabed, their father warned them that people would be seen outside the army from two corners.
From the perspective of some, it will be a feeling of respect and admiration because they defeated enemy uprisings and visited exotic sites.
But the other will turn his head if "under the surface there is no evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who took part in the wars in Iraq and after returning took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who had been interviewing him had inadvertently indicated if he could cope with the stress associated with the work in Washington as soon as he returned from the war.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The army's concern is partly driven by American greed for war.
The success of the battlefield is only a few times in recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a little of its own benefit.
"As a nation we no longer regard military herory as usual for the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the United States units in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are named for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to fight violence
This week will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other designers are ready to file a complaint.
Elizabeth Lyman's first class of soldiers was on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the wife on the airport base Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she hit her male colleague with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her so they could have a drink in her room.
"In my head there was a bright light," Lyman described.
But the Texas family totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband went to her, threw her to bed, and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington in Virginia and will be discussed in it as to whether an accusation against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is in contradiction with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
During the following months, however, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army, and the army failed to investigate, punish, and any abuse of justice.
Burke's claim is that he's going after the highest-ranking army commanders, because the problem is just starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts? The Supreme Command."
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of the other complaints submitted in the future.
Its strategy: More than collecting all the charges in this case - it put all the eggs in one basket, as it itself says - will file complaints in several cases, if the pressure is not to rise.
The defence team is led by the United States State Representative Neil MacBride, who, together with his employees, has been invited to refuse the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy - the principle is that the present or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court regulation, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Frequent injuries are related to the military services of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the '50s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in the battle, it is only a word of mouth: in modern wars it is only difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers continued to play a greater role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for the modernization of the army to take place, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except in her case, three other legal representatives are involved.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Legal Service Seminar are preparing a complaint to the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere conducive to hatred for women.
Regardless of the unnecessary organisation of the American Vietnamese veterans, he collects the grounds for his complaint against the army. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "infringement of personality", which was allegedly found in the victims of rape, so that the army has a warrant for their release - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a purely common practice.
In December, her group had already filed a motion for a complaint against the state organisation for dealing with veterans who were accused of discriminatory practices, to whom the processing of requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service was due.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of senators and Members of both political parties and proposed a whole range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Solved Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year.
The report issued in March also includes the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were received in 2010 - half against the civil justice system.
In the case of Agent Burke's, the complainants describe attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, the first class of soldiers, Lyman, reported alleged rape of the military police not an hour after they were supposed to come to him.
During the night, she said she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to the police, doctors and commanders eleven times.
All the investigations were carried out necessary for the purpose of rape, and in her bed was found the blood of an attacker - from the wound that she had done in custody.
About six months later, in April 2009, Lyman graduated from the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she was in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were invited to testify in favour of the alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day when judgment was brought," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was having a baby right there at the birth-- I ran out of the courthouse with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his court, it was mine."
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed her personality disorder, marking her as unfit for service.
In January 2010, the army was released without charge and therefore without appeal.
Whether Lyman's case and other prosecutors move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From the angle of my view, they should be able to move to further stages of the discussion."
However, there is this doctrine between them and the verdict, which has been criticised since the first time that the light of the world has been seen.
I'm the only lifetime critic of the Doctrine of the Faith Doctrine doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their duties do not allow them to comply with the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard on him... but it's important for them to try."
The change only comes when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoa, the plaintiff, will gather hundreds of other persons who are prepared to file a complaint and start working on other charges relating to this matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue from where reform does not come," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of justice in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-hospital opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murder warrant, after which 77 were dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in computer preparation, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right group on social networks.
After this year's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - just go out on Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The coverage of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says it has been enough for scientists to use the advertising on the pages and, thanks to this, clearly identified the demographic group that has been looking for - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million fans of rights groups who have focused on them and sent them advertisements, but instead of calling them to new groups that have been created or offering them some diet products, they have asked them to fill in the questionnaire, which raises questions about their education level, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line rights groups are all young men who encourage the growing degree of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hiding behind the computer screen."
The DEMOS team is just one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering attitudes updates, contributions on the screens and printed "I Like You".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on average every day, which from this social network makes the word "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, whose name is Facebook, has increased to about 800% in contrast to the state five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It was already paid that when you wanted to do research among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd never been left," says Bartlett.
"This is all about Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social and health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who chose their drinking performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept silent about this topic.
Morenová proposes that the students' team monitor the site and come with an offer of help to a student who publishes too many alcoholic status.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and Director of the Center for the Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify dangerous children that we should not have the chance to discover."
Facebook is constantly investigating data from its users.
The information team of the site developed statistics on the relationship status and St. Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction factor (mainly using the information they had access to - the Internet freedom defenders have long claimed that the site should access its information treasure to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility of playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it is necessary to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is available to everyone.
"In my opinion, most users did not even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using public facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they took information between them and their friends."
The following is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching off-line, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook there is no way to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years in researching new technologies, thinks that the prosecutor and writer are still the best tool available for research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Community research should be about companies and social activities - and the hell a lot of social activities are still going off-line."
"Cool and Non-Aligned": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter "defense".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian movement of resistance and among the Norwegian temple knights," he declared before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I hate the opposition to the court because you have been given the mandate of an organization that supports the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't confess any guilt to them."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought himself a ready word, to allow his relatives to speak at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned any contact with the media for 4 minutes and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to the hope that they will be able to look into Breivik's eyes, others to make sure he's held firmly under the lock.
They all took part in moving the case to a quick closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and unlucky," the NRC commented on one of the remaining attacks.
"It wasn't nice, but I can say to myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved on a little bit further."
Breivik, in the dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the time. On arrival and going to the building without difficulty looking for present journalists and surviving in the eye.
Despite Breiviko's bizarre idea that he was part of a major "response" movement, the judge found that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he would have a partner.
For someone, it can be comforting that the attacks of June 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
This, however, does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she would look like a creature, but it is not," said one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to the movie this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear, and they chose him for his genius as the most modern inventor.
For the recently republished Job's interview, which was designed for a special film that is heading to the movie this week, will be for all fans of Apple's company the fact that his creative mind completely understood the commercial processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a snowman and a self-employed member of the hippie movement, but at the same time also a pedant organizer and a person, who every detail ships into the smallest detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the really great idea is from 90% of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent result product is still a long journey of work."
In 1995 Bob Kringely worked on TV series Triumf of computer crazys, which discussed the creation of personal computers. During the film, he played a unique, more than an hour conversation.
At that time it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands working with his new NeXT computer company, and he was impatient to see how wide the public accept the Internet.
Finally, only a short part of the entire Kringely interview was used in the TV series and the original copies of the interview were betrayed that they were lost during transport.
Shortly after Job’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
Just this material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute image of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which leads to selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has expressed his desire to provide more conversation, Jobs here is so surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also looks like a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation, the question and the answer will take a longer pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when it is to see how Job’s answer is perfectly thought out to be as sharp and clear as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism is on the surface, when he acts impatiently and moves him to get faster on more important issues and topics.
The interview was made even before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and there are awfully prophetic thoughts in it, when Jobs values what other companies are doing well and badly, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job’s immortal evaluation of his career, but at Job’s, which we see here as a creative dream in the beauty of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision here of how things could and should look.
It didn't last long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also started putting them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How did he learn to drive a company:
"During the years of business, I always asked myself, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: "Well, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about things about business.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify the accounts in Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started by writing "standard costs", about their height could only be imagined. At that time he decided to express his own way - developed an automatic tool that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined during the moment.
How he made a barbecue on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modora Box", which was designed by Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively get on the phone and call anywhere in the world for free.
It was written in the past a whole series, but Job’s enthusiasm when the Blue Box describes it as a tool of power is literally contagious.
They tell how the device was tested with Wozniak using the pay phone and during the call they were allowed to connect from one AT&T network to the other while using the largest number of satellites.
"At least a dozen times we got so far around the world, so when we called on the pay phone, it was a minute later from the second phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young, and we found out that we were able to build ourselves a thing that is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that could have managed to control a lot of the bigger thing - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have come up without it.
Jobs continues a description of the game that almost ended with Wozniak. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, and they were giving up Henry Kissinger as best they could.
They were gradually invited to continue the membership of the Catholic Church to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they raised their own pope on the phone, the two spread and sat down.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he scand the spare parts to build a kilometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone number and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what such a society is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited a firm research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer that was ever made".
He was big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right now.
As a teenager, I acted up and up in HP, flaked around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation invents:
In a few jobs during the interview, they talk about how they invent new products after running.
In the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of boards with a flat connection, one customer asked him to put the whole computer together for it.
Only 30 paid days were available, during which he had to think, detonate and add the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalled the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had a pretty wild fight... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
About ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
As a big company, there is a breath:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs deliberately predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, there is already a government holiday and marketing, so companies are taking over people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are being questioned by the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led the company to its unbreakable position, is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could have been Microsoft for the '90s...
But instead of winning, they won the prize.
How to take innovation as an art form:
"There's still a long journey and a lot of work between a great idea and a great result product... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to come to the full range of compromises - certain things just do not cause electrons, glass, robots or factory.
You must keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and set them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to prevent them from doing what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists were copying, but the best artists were stealing.
I've never been ashamed that I broke the best ideas.
Macintosh was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and the world’s best computer experts at the same time.
Not being computers and new technologies, they would prove amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the opposition of the Health Care Act at the time when their case was handled by the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind the closed door to discuss a political controversial question, whether we would accept an objection to the President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in the celebration dinner sponsored by the legal firm that will participate before the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases considered was the complaint brought by 26 States questioning the radical reprocessing of health care that Congress approved last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the appeal would be heard. However, in March a 5.5-hour discussion is expected, which will also further develop the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full course at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who is standing before the court and will try to achieve a denial of the law will, most likely, be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney-General of the United States for the George W. Bush government.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society Group, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations of questionable laws, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in a process based on huge financial resources.
The dinner was held at the Washington Hotel several hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
She was also attended by Mitch McConnell, senior representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed opposition to the Health Care Act.
And host introductions?
This is nothing new: This two judges with action group Federalist Society has been participating for years.
And it certainly isn't about anything that would conflict with ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are just related and other organisations in order to obtain financial resources, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be introduced into the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomase with two law firms operating in the case, as well as companies with enormous financial interest in this case, was richly sufficient to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and negligence against the code of conduct is contrary to the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate for social benefits together with legal representatives waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of insecurity, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed their critics just a little bit of understanding and showed them that they too, without problems, combine their judicial responsibilities with the actions of groups, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a highly established conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not with Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the governments of President Obama when the first opposition to the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics pressured her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she was fighting so much for the law that she could now be uninvited.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record order for the $18 billion flow aircraft
Aerolinks Emirates order 50 double-hull Boeing 777 airships with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six-year-old Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air airlines, for which it is investing more than USD 1 billion.
If a company gets an order on 50 pieces of its products, it's mostly no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-year-olds makes up a record of USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important report is also from where Boeing received the order: Middle East, growing gold for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airports in the Middle East will need $2,520 million in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history regarding dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double-inch Boeing 777.
The sensory order came from the Emirates airlines in Dubai.
Boeing company at the 2011 Dubai Air Show fair announced that airlines have the possibility to buy another 20 aircraft, which would result in a total value of USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is much better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six-year-olds exceeds USD 1 billion.
"It's an excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airports in the Middle East belong to the darkest nations of the world.
This means that they have not only the money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - most damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself makes oil at higher prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as they are with other airlines that they could cancel or withdraw aircraft orders for fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract confirms Boeating’s leading position on the market with a wide-ranging aircraft and leads to the narrow Airbus SAS that wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives have announced that it will be the first flight of their largest A350, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
The removal was due to the customer’s demand for more useful aircraft loads and flights, so the manufacturer took time to allow the machine to add more engine power.
Boeing Co has increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The Mexican President's sister was defeated, according to everything in the Mychoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon, from PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the cave behind the governor's throne.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon, in the violent state elections, lost a governor's post in Michoacán. On Monday, she said that one of her opponents helped drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results contributed to the leadership in the presidential elections of the Western state of Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The mandates of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and, in particular, then to yesterday's elections itself is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion study group... they had fun with the polls, they had road jams... and they let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI side ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the Presidency came.
However, planning a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the elections, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative side of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Valleyon as a winner.
The third place is Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, who has so far ruled the governing authority. For the party that has been divided and persecuted, the party is going before the presidential elections in 2012 with a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of the state, on behalf of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and invites other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and in December 2006 he launched a military fight against converts.
However, the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, the leader of Luisy Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the election and many candidates from the election were out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks like for the PRI side, victory on the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected PR representative in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington Valley, congratulated and said, "I think that this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
The ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could reach the overall decline of the world economy, which would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the ADB Bank, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" in order to help quickly build a currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European problems "too unresolved" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and funds would help to welcome the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So everyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is appropriate," said the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay during a discussion.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months.
In the last few days, Italy's loan costs have been dangerously rising and the Italian and Greek presidents have retreated.
The growing debt crisis in Europe was alarmed by the fact that the global economy could re-launch the recession and the call for new emerging leading economies to link up and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of loans from the Fund for European Union financial assistance, the European financial stability institution - would provide the Asian partners with more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and the withdrawal of foreign capital.
"No one wants Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a gross fact, because otherwise we could find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indians, have nothing to do with European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashtosh Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to explain aid to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One could find that the Greeks go to retirement in the 50s and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, likewise questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain a well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous dominant effect".
The Bank predicts that in Asia between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth, it is now facing a "risk of decline" because of the European threat.
He said that vulnerable developing markets must create "predictable spending plans" to protect themselves from the decline and significant withdrawal of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon on possible defence traps
On Monday, the Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, in Congress, firmly added to the bell when he warned that the emerging automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing through the fighting in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a budget reduction of USD 450 billion over the next ten years, but it is now worrying about a reduction of USD 600 billion if Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these scraps would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach a budget agreement and hence a so-called halt would cause 23% to slow down and stop many new projects.
"Because of this huge reduction, which is used in this disproportionate way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three-quarters of the building or ship. In addition, it could cause serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also have to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is so fast, we will also have to send almost certain civilians on a forced leave to be able to meet the targets."
"These changes can poison the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously harm its readiness."
Finally, the wreckage touched and the fighting units, Panette announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations in the sea do not directly affect this stock, darker operations will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual staff, which will result in delays in agreements supporting the military efforts of our people."
"There will be reduced rates of paid employees, from which the late payments will also be paid to suppliers and the subsequent interruption of legal and political support."
Both senators of Pannett wrote to him ten days ago and asked him for details of possible impacts on the automatic damage to the defence ministry.
"The consequences of the situation at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a global military power."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not the conclusion that we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned conflicts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Panette's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of restricted areas.
Panetta has recently been more open in discussions about possible shortcomings, although he himself went to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was going to leave in the dark.
At the press conference a minute a week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a brief picture of what his resort can wait for - an army crash, which will be missing the core.
"They'll be like a ship without sailors."
"They'll be like brigade without ammunition."
"They'll be like a plane without trained pilots."
"They will be like a tiger, like a married army, a building and a bomb without enough trained soldiers to finish the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the Pentagon talk.
"They will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to balance a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex to the letter to McCain and Graham's Panel, it specifies how to reduce the result of "significant operational risk: late response to the crisis, conflict and disaster; significant limitations on the possibilities of exodus and deployment worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future war operations."
Panetta also added that some of the largest defence projects could wait for termination, including those that have already been tested, and those that are just in the early stages of planning.
For example, there was a project on the F35 aircraft planned for a new bomber, a ballistic substation of a new generation, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based combat vehicle that the army and the seabed wanted to replace humvee.
By halting further development and testing of the F35 airport, 80 billion USD would be saved over the next ten years, but its stoppage claims it is a necessary further step in improving the army that is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Identify the Lie
The summer view of recent news headlines tells how serious and all-powerful lies and deception are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full hand with the charge of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other is lying.
The managers at the Penn State University were accused of a false witness when they tried to hide the records of a retired football coach sexually assaulted the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught, as American President Barrac Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, told by a microphone released.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and close up the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately distorted by unmistakable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the funds from his campaign to try to hide his marital status.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that was shooting around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in charge of his sexual drive with Monica Levinski.
It's just a story of cheating at school and at the university everywhere.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students a test answer, just to make them look good in their own judgment.
Mentors who are supposed to teach vices send out a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show that you are lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases on a single day.
Suppose a lot of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, foreign people were lying three times.
The definition of a lie, or "the recognition of a lie", is a necessary skill that everyone should gain, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharad, when a person screams, "I have you." The identification of the lie is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the investigation is that most of the old myths of the lie were betrayed.
Lies are quietly looking into your eyes.
It's not like they'd stick around, cocktails, reds, or sweats.
However, do not take it for granted that it is a difficult lie to warn and expose.
The school identifier lies can reveal the truth from a large building, small expressions in the face, how to create questions and their timing.
I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the vast and developing sector of the recognition of lies and it is clear that the discovery of the lie is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your duties include the appointment, the arrangement of interviews, the negotiation or the management of people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be taken into custody, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men behave more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly because to protect some feelings - that marriage people lie less often to their partners than free people (although the lies that they say are mostly "unparalleled").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "the initial observation."
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Note the keeping of the body of the subject, his smile, the work with the voice.
You should know if someone keeps sticking to your feet so you don't unduly blame him for lying just because in the middle of a meeting, you start to stick to your feet.
Then try to determine the meaning of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider it just as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tip of the button can move to the door, move to the exit, significantly change the position of the body, or give an indication of "the relief after the end of the conversation" - exaggerated sudden breathing and change of position when there is a difficult response to them.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see what will look like after it is finished.
Take the subject's language as well.
Famous is the story of Scott Peterson once saying that he used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which led to a state-wide search for her body.
Claiming individuals can also say in a fair way, "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Levinski" or the difficult question is all over again.
The most common verbal signs are just very subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "aggravating language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... of what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In this response, we do not know too much about the facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to gain skill through which lies can be exposed.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of finding a liar and a liar in his personal and workless absence.
Controversy plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the US Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was respected by the committees, but calmed by environmentalists - the company with the pipeline building announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could be moved again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that the transfer of the planned route would be a tube from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebras, and is convinced that the project will be approved as well.
This decision was notified by the company at a press conference in the headquarters of the Nebraska Government.
TransCanada's Steps Alex Parbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipe will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last week that it postponed a federal project permit decision, from which it did not conduct a study of possible replacement routes, which would allow it not to enter the Sandhills area in Nebras and Ogallal waters, extended groundwater resources.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebrasky for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have withdrawn any decision until 2013, i.e. the year following the elections next year, however, the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the Ministry abroad and expressed his support for it.
1 700 miles long tube will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refinery in Texas, it protects 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
This way will have to be extended to six states.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the tube.
However, the legislators in Nebraska have set themselves up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to enter the Sand Hills region and Ogallal waters, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, however, the source of the energy industry said that the general inspector of the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
It was once that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who in 2008 was counselor of Hillary Clinton, did not represent the conflict of interest program.
Next, whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having returned fear because of her battalion
New York's family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle almost threw into the vestibule of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter so that she got rid of that fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" hits the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of other people," her family claims in a complaint to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
On November 10, last year, Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a teacher at the school, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Rosane Monkova met down in the lobby of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and carried with him and Genevieve.
Rosaanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a while and she put her child down for a moment.
"Somebody showed up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle's pregnant woman was suddenly bitten.
"An aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter in the door," said Rosane Monková.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking in silence, screaming out the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started looking for me.
They say Genevieve got hysterical arrest.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." "Mother said the child.
LaBelle went to her mother - who had still in her arms Genevieve - threw her out and had to stop her until her escort, which subsequently dragged her to the waiting car, said Rosana Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she returned, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but no reply was received.
Lawyer and speaker LaBelle won't respond to our phone calls to make a statement about the whole cause.
The complaint calls for closer unresolved compensation, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family is planning to spend all the money spent on charity for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is intended against a teacher from a school holding an eight-month-old child."
Climate's Unhappiness Distorted the Economy
During the first year of government Maria López Valdez grew unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them and the economy
The year 2011 is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which itself calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it a great expectation in terms of economic progress, but for reasons of adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and there has even been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low autumn temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the potential for growth in the state economy, have a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first half of this year, and a 31.16% decline in agriculture, which has disrupted the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to reports of the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
The decline in economic activity until November led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, unemployment rates in the country increased during the first three quarters of the year. From January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa, representing the unemployment rate of 4,53% of the economic active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6,19%, representing about 74 000 unemployed.
Less Liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment related to various factors. Among them are the loss of liquidity on the market for reasons of limitation of resources due to legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally strengthen their dollars, it is not easy to make, invest or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes stated that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, but this is because of the slow entry and then because even though these people get abroad, it's hard for them to get work. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so the unemployment is growing," he said.
Untrusted
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening because of the growing uncertainty that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed people in the state are working without reducing social security administration.
Other labour market features, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and non-reliance. In this administrative area, the lowest payments are from the country as indicated by the registry of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, deep under the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Abbreviation of direct foreign investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, there has also been the most significant decline in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment of $630,697 was achieved from January to June, representing a decline of 87,74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State has made investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Dluh
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government of this country requested in July a State Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be aimed at investing in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. By November, no profit was recorded from the debt, and no sector in the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdès indicated a lack of governance.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transforming Industry, said that in 2011 there was a failure to comply with the will of the individual sectors, including the state's own governments.
"The evolution of the economy in Sinaloa has been truly inconvenient during this year. We must work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, fail to harmonise the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully, the next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López pointed out that events such as the beginning of the year had stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"A weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the cold. One of the main consequences was a slowing down of the economy, which was not remembered enough quickly to re-establish dynamicity, which would enable the acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services to be achieved.
Responsibilities
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, the President of the Employer's Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to move towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we note that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared, in which the objectives and economic direction of the State would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future, which would better control the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress with regard to the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be attractive. I can say that there is a job done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Accused for 8 kg of marijuana
The inhabitants of Navolato were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of imprisonment for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuel Sandoval. He was convicted of a criminal health threat, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 at the crossing of Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th station in El Castillo district, Navolato.
Dealer drove in a delivery type pick up white colors. In the car in the box had a black bag and on the seat of the co-pilot a small boat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Legal Impact of Offences.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of the programs such as Habitat, Public Places Protection and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger of not being touched to the end or of being very late for lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of urban social development has stated that, if construction work has progressed so far, it is now threatening that the government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require more than 11 million weights for three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million weights. The state accounts for 25%. Only the Federation and the city were added to work at this time, so it is possible that projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to secure nearly 12 million and although the year is about to end, we're not getting anything, and even though we're supposed to get a share already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we've started and continued very bravely, but we're missing the money."
He pointed out that last year, the government of Jesse Aguilara Padilla failed to comply with the relevant supplies, so at the beginning of the new period, he had to ask for a loan to pay more than 7 million who did not have the government.
"The same thing has already happened to us in the previous sixties, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the aforementioned programmes this year, we had to get funds that would cover what did not end the state," he explained.
In spite of the fact that there is an appeal from the State representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that Armand Villarreal, the administrator's secretary for administration and finance had been sent to speed up the proceedings and that the corresponding percentage had arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is near the end, we've never gotten any weight."
The court approves the "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador against the presidential decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "offence of analogous signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He found that there were no eight votes necessary to disarm it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to earthly digital television.
As a result, the complaint submitted by the Senate was rejected, and because the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order to enable the Court to express its determination or inconsistency of the said decree, which remains valid.
The proposal for a judgment drawn up by the Ministry of Finance, Mr Sánchez Cordero, proposes the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all radio and television issues is a matter which is replaced by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) under the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Ambassadors supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight against the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of the Ministers also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Ambassador without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not be structured through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analogous digital signals is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It relates to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is believed that to remove the change would mean to remove the benefits of digitisation that requires a decision in the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "need the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the State. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the State".
He recalled that a whole number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to bring an inconsistent decree, which to some extent affects the area of power of Congress, into the area of administrative compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PreP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent. So far, votes 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The "voice-by-voice" option appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections was not all 27 per cent, and it has not yet been counted 879 votes from the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this connection, the President-in-Office of the Electoral Council in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandelal Zaragoza, recalled that a number of measures were approved by the electoral authority a few days ago, on 9 November, to harmonise the local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán has not officially confirmed its political institution nor its State Election Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period was due and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel mentioned their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official Public Prosecutor, because he had some objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the State's head of state in the matter of constitutional reforms as "inapplicable and illegal", because it has no right "to approve them or veto them".
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal answered that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, the General Council of the IEM would be able to carry out partial and comprehensive calculations by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of counting of votes and calculation in the appropriate box or the president has not available them; or if there are errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all election hours will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request by the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when, after proper reading, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also when there is an explicit request by the political party whose candidate ended in the second place. In this case, the electoral packages in which the partial calculation was carried out will be determined.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second non-totals 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be blown up in the Fireland, confirmed by the family.
The rest of Felipe Bacio Cortés' pilots were transported by Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, the ceremony and the evening Mass will take place.
According to the family, it was a Colonel's last wish that his ashes be dissolved in the Fireland.
After the family returned to Coahuil's main city on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and the closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, he arrived in the chapel in Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 p.m. there was a dissolution at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which organized his former colleagues from the technology school and members of the American football team, whose Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of the graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was to have his ashes dissolved up in the Fireplace. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and went to the college of college del Aires in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that he was driving a truck, but he always followed his dream as a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him of him as a very good man, "sorry he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died at what he had in his life best: flying.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, deputy commander of the Mexican Air Force, we have given up all the directions that the governor Jorge Torres López, the citizen and government of the state, the Mexican army through the six military zones, the Mexican Air Force alone, the leaders and students of the University of Saltillo Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he won both in the study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter that was driving. He was also on board the government's secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05 the remnants of the Saltilen relative Bacio Cortés (recorded) arrived to be handed over through funeral services by the Mexican air force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where his family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, relatives and other relatives, students and teachers gathered together.
There were three abandoned dead bodies on the ship Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the military was found, the representatives represented 11 persons who were detained in this area for crimes linked to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and heads were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was located at 1.5 kilometers from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the chat with the bee-coffee area had a door open from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three feet [3 m] away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person had yellow sports shirts and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to it, a person was also sitting in a sports shirt with white stripes.
About a few meters further, there were other persons dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face to face.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three persons were probably murdered elsewhere because they were not found.
On the floor of the chat area were found messages addressed to one group of organised crime the other and also a number of feet after bullets, both on the building and on the doors.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secrets represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyt and who were linked to kidnappings, murders, persecution and unlawful burial.
According to the information published during the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detainee was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6 o'clock, military personnel were on the run in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he noticed the car without the SPZ and two persons in it.
After the car was stopped, they took a look and found one gun, a gun, and 18 guns.
Then, based on these statements, on 13 November, around 14 o’clock, one of La Frauda’s complicities was detained. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that this country is holding over the economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country above the economic disaster and which has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report stating that Monti, appointed on Sunday, meets with President Giorg Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
It is expected that it will represent the government with a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet obvious when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks, which he led with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to create a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in just three days, so much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in an unsustainable debt.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim must approve the hard package of resistance measures required by European leaders, which will only restore Italy's established credibility.
There is a great pressure to speed up on Monti. Due to the instability of the markets, interest in the Italian bonds BTP with a 10-year maturity was exceeded by 7 percent, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Employers' Organization, told reporters after the meeting with Montim: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this nuclear situation.
Monti's hopes for success have been significantly affected by the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis took place on Saturday to resign.
"We assume that the efforts of Professor Monti are doomed to good results," Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the media, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because so far, a whole number of its members have turned against the government with the technocrat majority set up by Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament to promote non-popular sustainable reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure and warned that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started a discussion on Monday with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, which allowed for a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi was giving a demo, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical border and responded to uncertainty as to whether the new president of the government was making a success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is in the amount of EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the scope of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should hold power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that say politicians only give him time to carry out reforms and then issue early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to join his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to remove Italy from the country's difficulties due to financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate attempts to engage in government and political personality.
Spanish with participating international matches more often than Costa Rican
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 popular players has reached 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and Europe champions, the number one-month FIFA rating, have on their account a wide range of class A inter-selective matches, Costa Rica has only the defender Michael Uman, who as the only player played 50 international matches.
Tohoto numbers reached last Friday in the struggle against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Battle of the Stars and in the strong clubs of the first English league, maintain an intensive activity over the year in the league championships and home cupcakes and high-level matches in the European Cups like Champions League.
In the past, we also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in the complex struggles for European and world championships.
On the contrary, the Costa Rican players have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the field. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign hits from the Spanish representation has on its own account Iker Casillas, who arrived at the former Andoni Zubizzerreta with 126 international hits last Saturday in front of England (the 0-1 in London).
Casillas also comes against Costa Rica today and gets a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were officially declared UEFA last week with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their own account. Among them is Zubizzarreta with 126 and the mid-term attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred approached Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Next Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cec Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and near Michael Uman are moving the left wing of Junior Díaz with 48 matches and Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 won 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 matches, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and is followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, has two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, base Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next week.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play at Costa Rica is a complete dream.
That's what the baseman and the founder member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the course of the tour at the occasion of the 20th anniversary of its existence, and on Sunday 20th it will be the only stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the English group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the conversation you will find on the La Nazion pages on the internet.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming reality.
In South and Central America, we were hardly the second and present experience was great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to spend a few days here.
So we're very happy that we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because the group literally adores this group, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most scalable beneficiaries?
Thank you for staying with us for so long.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that causing more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been created in the horizon for several weeks.
We took a few great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to that concert.
We love this country, we love serfing, we like jungles. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rican and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best surfing places. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played here, we have no limits that we can't do.
We will try to play the best show with various compositions. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 collections and everyone likes other collections, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we'll remember why we liked them and that we may already have forgotten.
So it's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour you celebrate 20 years of artistic careers.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
At first, I think none of us could imagine that we're going to be in a big rock band and that we're going to stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much has been given to us and we are impressed that we can still play together.
We love each other, and we love to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which they are represented by the great ones themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a move comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group will emerge in the city, but it is much less common to have five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that arose in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to keep a relationship and have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think we're all lucky at first that we're still in this world, and the second we play is that we're always interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and this has made it possible for us to open up music paths that leave every person with sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, respect each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word of praise was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually the easiest way to find a balance.
We're trying not to go too far on the tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of dawgs and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it. You can't let yourself get away with being famous rock stars.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something big.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released any albums until Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy how incredible it was as I talked to him. It was always the joy to work with him, laugh, play music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Corps will be entrusted with launching a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as an advance?
Yes, the production sent us a video with a few suggestions and this group liked us the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas will offer alive and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter alive?
That's Eddie Vedder's question, so I don't know.
He sings her and I think he's adding the first thing he's gonna do.
Who's affecting you as a base?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Etwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though he's not in fashion anymore?
I think we've always felt a slight separation from the grunge word.
When the grunge is said, I imagine the groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And if this music applies today, it's something great, because it's the music that stands for it and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it's more positive.
What's behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that in the new album there are a few compositions that are easier to make, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered to be very dull, although they can sound positive.
At the two when Ed played it to me, I cried, and it's deep dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs for me represent this.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still do the silent music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he was to be tested for muscle loss, which he suffered in the area of lower limbs, informed his treating doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who suffers from 25 years of deprivation of freedom for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including cancers of the tongue, which have been operated four times and are now under control by doctors.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is hurt and why he loses his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could obtain mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not deny it because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times for cancer of the tongue, weighed 18 kilograms, and added to these problems other disorders such as severe erosion gastritis, spleen cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and running problems, appointed a doctor.
Fujimori has been punishing himself since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murder squad of an army unlawfully operating in the first years of his government.
Music at a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by a number of ministers and businessmen, starts a visit to Mexico Tuesday, with the aim of reaching an expansion of trade between the two nations and touching the political themes of the region.
The music will meet with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with the representative of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office published on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to adopt Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy made a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, and this declaration raised a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico is the president of the G20 since November. The G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With that Latin American country, it has since January this year concluded an information exchange agreement to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to concreteise a tax exchange agreement with a view to getting from the "black list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is countries that have not established all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of data.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has strengthened trade between the two countries.
Vousate installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting illegally for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's crimes, but has never appeared in 3D before: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl with stereotypical technology.
The title, which comes this month into all shops around the world, has been created from the beginning to use all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a post that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created especially for this carrier", because so far successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations to existing titles.
Speaking Nintendo said that besides the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and exhausting game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go to the "second wheel" at the level games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not depend on optical curves".
This new Super Maria in 3D also suggests a return to the transmission console, which has not been reached since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the notes of those who watch the saw and repeat a successful formula from the previous pieces. It includes that the installer of a man's vassate will have to go through dangerous latent platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the movement, in the surroundings, in the embraces, and also among the enemies, Luigi is also shown.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who will be responsible in the United States for spending 70 million dollars.
This is the end of the process, the purpose of which was for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country, which requires the issue of Portilla, so that it can be judged.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He ensured that during his term of office, he "did not interfere" with the decisions and allowed all the issues that he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and severe health injuries and Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means the execution step after all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to lead the proceedings against the former President who ruled in 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
The Portillo was found innocent in the case of a 120 million in the Ministry of Defence at the time of its presidency. This process was preceded by the release, but the Ministry of Public Affairs withdrew and returned the case to the game.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization has been created to help children without education so that they do not feel at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of Trinijo's social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has helped them over 25 years to overcome difficult situations.
To this end, it is necessary to add a hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
The last year also served to present the balance sheet under the celebration act, which took place in the former factory premises of Fabra and Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijo's organization was created in the fourth Trinitt Vella in 1986, with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work dealing with drug dependence or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Last night, a large number of representatives of the organisations and institutions involved in the Sant Andre meeting, who worked with the association in the last 25 years.
The various political representations at the time of the elections showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijos.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall, and former mayor of old age and current environmental-socialist council Richard Goma participated in the celebration act.
In the large hall Fabra and Coats, a current councillor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and General Director of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived.
Mas said that Trinijo was born in a very difficult time and that today's time also sparks a whole series of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President cited Trinijo as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it is doing, I'm doing nothing new," he said.
There was a ban on the house where giant parties were held
Windmills own 11 out of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupyors left the house yesterday at noon without putting up the resistance
It all points out that the nightmare experienced by neighbors in the 51st Street of Balmes is finally over.
Yesterday, 12 people volunteered to leave a building that they illegally lived in and where they organised giant parties that built neighbors. They left the building from the court regulation and did not have to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the manager said.
The occupants who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are settled - took all the electrical and partly water facilities, and also painted the walls and left after themselves all kinds of waste, especially bottles after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and blew up other tenants.
There's a discotheque next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that after the construction, the markets fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasises that the occupants of the buildings made it competitive because they sold drinks for 3 euros where the discotheque stands at 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the demands of neighbors for noise. Although the problems did not affect the visitors of the discotheques, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, in particular, those who attended the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks have grown, according to the scattered inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and would forgive her for nine months.
The local police have also confirmed that over the past few weeks, they have received more complaints from their neighbors in the situation.
The president of the PP People's Party at the Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately removed and thus ended with problems of civil coexistence suffering from neighbours and destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one staircase had been removed a year ago, but in recent months, the inhabitants had reached all the patrons of the building and almost all the apartments, and even in one of them there had been theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent if it concerns the consequences of the civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday the city police also cleaned up the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes the police arrived in building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by the neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the writing of proceedings that carry more than the issue of honours
The city selection process on 16 branches reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the greatest flowering already disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collerola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metro park of Barcelona.
More than that, it was complemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not point to the north or the north - but up (hora) - down (the sea).
The Collesroly qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild bears instead of Yogi bears.
This was the position until September when the Council issued a mega competition of 16 competitions for the same number of entry gates to Collesroly.
The gate, of course, is recording more of the park's thoughts.
Either this or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on a reflection about the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as sharp as the two members of this old caste chosen at the meeting in the elevator hand in hand.
And that's exactly what he called one of the rare harmonys between what three Barcelonan architects think and the prestigious university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its reasons.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "must be discussed also about the "mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerd's presentation of green apples was not touched to the end.
"We must come from the principle that the longest Barcelona Park is the beach.
In addition to its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said an architect, for whom the name "doors to Collserola" in itself is "lexicological paste": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of the zone where it is possible to operate".
The module, like Roldán and Bayon, with the experience of urbanism, qualifies as a "intellectual challenge" that sparks "some danger".
The danger arising from "the indiscriminateness that today represents a public place project" after the experience of the 80s, which had in the forum "their singing lab".
The first concern is the very definition of borders where it should be built.
"Something is meant to take another step", it is in principle to move on.
"There must be new urbanist and planning tools in mind, because those current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real loss".
If we look more closely at the question, the Modol is believed to be "considered to be a park", but the Barcelonan part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
The module also recalled that there is already work that Patronat de Collserola has done, which "must not end at the site", even though he welcomes the fact that the workers offer his gruesome, that the project will take place from "the first moment".
And it also understands that the proximity of the mountains and cities is sort of a breakthrough that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he adds), which should be created: "Architects should be only tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because in the basis for the selection procedure there is a lack of global vision of Collserol: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no further study that would look into the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least him to join all 16 electoral procedures.
On the other hand, the project of one gate may challenge the concept and definition of the neighboring gate architect.
In his opinion, the Council should ensure that the band located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure that the entire area of equipment is extended to ensure a gas transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed to Jonas Larrazábal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legislator of Cadino Red granted his brother the grace of old age Monterrey in the process in which he was sought for alleged exorbitance.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal officer Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in a particular county, which discussed the case of the kidnapping in which the old-age brother of Monterrey was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel jonás had to apply for an economic quota to allow the workers in Monterrey to operate illegally in the auction house.
After a public complaint, the Public Prosecutor's Office initiated the criminal harassment of a Panistian elder brother. On 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours before the Public Ministry Agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
The following 49 days after the second prison regulation was adopted and the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs lost the possibility of co-existence or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta to suspect that the owners of Casino Red had lost one and a half million pounds. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to arrest, issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that, almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence had been collected to prove Jonah's guilt. Among the evidence, for example, the payment of 1.5 million weights to casino representatives in exchange for a claim that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal officer of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the old-fashioned brother of the region. On this basis, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal discussion with the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners decided to grant mercy. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
On the basis of the Official Journal of 197/2011, the legal mercy of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process that was led against him, no complaint will be made. Nor can it be requested to compensate for damage or punishment.
After being remanded with the legal power, about 15:50 the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, went to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case was transferred to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the air crash, where the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the incident, in which the government's secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, had died, showed that the helicopter had fallen directly to the ground with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the Secretary of Communications and Transport, stated that before the start of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions allow for years.
"Parts that appear indicate that the unit has come in contact with the field several times, the wings have been intertwined in the tree plant 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, so he met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of assault.
"The search found that parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane was found on the ground as a celestial.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The ground is fresh with a glass of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary has ensured that it is most important at the present time to obtain the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the attack, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at the speed of the flight and an accident occurred on the soft elevated terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that in the time of the accident, it was a regular over-flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome appointed six key investigative points:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is headed at the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico, the ground level was clouded at low altitudes.
Selected tracks:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of attack.
The coordinates of the attack and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that before the attack there was no loss of control or failure of the flight path.
Dissolve the residues of the aeroplane in a restricted area:
The information we have currently available allows us to assume that there has been an attack on the same tractor and on the side.
The design of the rest of the aircraft indicates that at the time of the attack on the ground, the helicopter was celeistic.
There was no fire or explosion.
Unfortunately, no evidence was found to testify that there was an explosion or a fire.
The final results of the investigation show that it could have come to several contacts with the fortress.
During field work the rest of the aircraft was found up to 9200 feet above the sea, the ground is cooled, the height of the wing is from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the pictures that were likely to break down along the routes mentioned above.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could reach contact with the country in a number of places.
After a careful search in the area of an accident, in an area that is more extensive than the area of the drain, no remains were found in the helicopter, which reinforces the belief that the attack occurred in the condition when the helicopter was still celestial.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance began a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to find the gene responsible for the care of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts research to detect a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" allows for results in excess.
In a report by the Head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team was set up consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers.
This team is supported by experts and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Joining the research can also be a wide public, with or without authorisation. People can join the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every congregation will be conducting tests for 8 hours.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Non-Zahualcoyolt Sports Centre (Mexico State East).
As soon as data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sport Centre of Independence (so far from the Federal District) and finally at the Sport Centre Morelos (so far from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the ingredients and the importance of genetics as regards the development of obesity, and to highlight the risk factors for Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the objective of collecting data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, was to apply specific food questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It clarified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, band range), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are being performed every Saturday and genes are being tested (try to identify genes that share child obesity).
Cruz López stated that this research reflects the concerns of doctors about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
'The health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and a 47% increase in girls.
He stated that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the belief that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics are usually explained as a failure to burn excess energy, which we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will be given an overall assessment of the status of children, which will determine whether they have any known superiority or obstetrics.
He noted that even the presence of dark-coloured (acantosis) arm (acantosis) arm and forehead suggest that the individual in question would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
The information is still reliable, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in lifestyle that they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the current way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, full-day exposure to television and the use of means of transport instead of a short distance walk.
The emphasis also causes a large caloric intake, which is greater consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fats and proteins and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no challenges in Asphalt with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If there was a need to correct almost 200 thousand claims after each rainy season in Valle de México, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the University of Chemicals (FQ) at the UNAM, warned that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt claims were adequate, a significant limitation of the claims would have occurred or even could have been completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological Cause of Explanations, which he presented during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that a laboratory under its leadership develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera is believed to be using this type of modified asphalt in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the production of perfumes.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the sum of the molecules of hydrocarbons, the molecules with a large molecular mass called asphalts, and other with a low molecular mass called maltens. Together they supply asphalt with a typical viscoeltic character.
The viscous nature of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost firmly fixed, while at low temperatures it has a tendency to laminate, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures have been observed by the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemicals observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexibilities made of six types of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt cartridge, made of small rocks with asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes a cartridge is to swallow asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the faucet are well spread.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would be even better, considered a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge, the last layer called the plaice, made of fine stones, is also the sand of the asphalt.
In view of the fact that this layer will come into contact with vehicle rifles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt plug and must ensure that the vehicle is trained.
Given that as part of the debt will be a major burden, the plaice must have enough fat and must pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great impact on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the area is wet, the water spreads inside and is hard to get out, it causes all kinds of perforations to melt, and this causes swelling.
He explained that during the creation of an adjuvants, the film was the first to be filmed and then damaged by an asphalt cartridge. However, it is not allowed at one time, but it is a process that should be stopped by the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of the vehicle is another important factor in the creation of an abrasion, and therefore the thickness of each individual abrasion layer must correspond to the load of a vehicle and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that with regard to asphalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research to begin. For example, there are asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and enable us to easily correct the conditions without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to receive Miss Columbia's crown.
Valle's getting the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach Miss Colombia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she had gone to the winning stage, won a silver crown and a syrup, based on which she became the new first multi-woman Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, which won and won Miss Atlántico, the department won the first 14 titles. Melina thus joined the representatives of the women from Valle del Cauca, who had won the winning crown, but finally were declared the first vicemises. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés (Aljure, Castaldo) (2000).
The question that many people are arguing about.
The result is the defeat of a great favor that has shown in all previous rounds that it is to become a new Miss Columbia, and not to become the Queen Police and the Nähezčý face of Joel de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently also took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to name it only the First Most Miss is that she did not confess her answer to the question, "Which book you liked most and why?", which Martin Murillo Gomez put in the literary editor Leos.
The candidate replied to the question:
"I read a lot. I really believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in childhood was the Little Prince, a very deep book.
At the present time, I read "Criminal and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. It is a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not popular due to the term "culturalize" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual cited books had mentioned.
After the conclusion of Melina's celebration, she declared that she was in peace and was delighted with the result: "The world is wise, what is going to happen will happen.
And you people read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotian journalist pointed out that from the beginning the candidate was the most popular, unprovoked, and the one who took all the previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), sparked the addiction of other guests, shook the queen, who then burned on the stage.
It was clear at the first presentation of the sails on the Hilton beach and during two screenings before the final crowning.
Although on both sides, it was known that she lacked the power and the blow that represented Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at Canal RCN's program, believes that Melinda has won the first multi-disser's title confirms the fact that a candidate who wins the most titles during the contest does not finally go with the crown of the queen."
In addition, Valle has been more vulnerable to the media in the last few days, and this has not cost him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Competition of Beauty.
On the other hand, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty stated that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Columbia's beauty competition alone, there is a need to see more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they join the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was on the back of her back. However, it is completely in conflict with the verdict of the jury that chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, admits that Melina had no better body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her ass, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, put on her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, the magazine Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that a relative from Valle made a mistake when she took several surgical steps.
"The surgery's okay, but they didn't happen in Valle.
The body was never her strong side, and here she chose her tax."
For the reason of this assessment, which first made the National Assembly of Beauty, after watching the swimsuits, there was a harsh prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melinė wished not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina began today's year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali, who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, an expert on fingerprints from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints that work for the CTI department, Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejad, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years, was this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the laundry to get to the place where the dead had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the main city of Valle and after he graduated from the relevant courses he began specializing in fingerprints. This science is involved in the study of cutting the skin, which is by hand and foot.
In the week that the operation against Alfonsi Can was carried out, Eliezer was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He went to Cauca on Friday night at the cemetery from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with Guillerm Leon Sáenze's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigating team to the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it for the reason of physical vision.
He didn't have a hairdresser, he was dressed as a peasant in a given area, without glasses, much more silky.
But the prints are slow.
Along with a galton lupu, an inks, and a transplanter and light, Eliezer began to compare the fingerprint records of the dead with the records from the card.
She didn't miss it: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was really the Supreme Commander Farc.
Search stopped
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliezer González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscope is accurate science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding criminal acts.
In addition to the identification of the dead, these people help in investigating criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the case of an injury, he had to remove a piece of house wall in the house because the thief had refused to take out a treasure full of spices and money in this place.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also confirm or eliminate suspicion in the case of murder.
They found a dead man recently with a bottle of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be conclusively confirmed that he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the prints "extend with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the delicent database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that at present there are still many Colombians whose data are not elsewhere," a CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is the way it's shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything you're shaking, it's not gold, it's not everything you touch, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Smoothing" protests in New York City
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to settle.
A large part of them were waiting for a clearance order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Movement Obsate Wall Street provoked on Tuesday the representative of New York when they tried to get back to Manhattan by court order, where they were expelled in the morning, and then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through the court order that allows the "stolen" to return to the place. The second part of the movement responded to the cleansing by taking the park to the north of the city where another detention took place.
"If the court won't allow us to go back to the square, we'll sit in another place and continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, and it's both through the assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers, "Let's stay on Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the answer to the "suffered" to the removal of the camp, which he himself ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was reached to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent removal of the camp and allowed the protesters to remain here.
In addition, they took another park located on the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Netherlands tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the plot of the Farah in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take their place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to support them and has also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zukotti, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to be held on Tuesday, during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave it to members who were watching the venues, which called for "some small shots", Bray, who condemned the fact that some politicians were demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use the "laws that were published after the notice began, or to prohibit the protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used earlier".
Starosta Bloomberg stated for the press that in view of this court order, the city had stopped opening the public space again and the protesters warned that local laws did not allow them to return to their state and packaging.
The city's highest representative personally defended the early removal of Zuccotti, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined because the protesters were "infringing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate places because there was "a place where people didn't protest, but violate laws and in some cases harm others", because "some shops received dangerous letters" and "the neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The early cleansing was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests in the face of the American working people," he added the speaker's move, who accused the old man of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they plan to organize "great actions" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organisations to recall two months after the protests took place.
Pamela Anderson will represent Miss Maria in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, she will appear on December 1st, in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was assistant Tim Allen in Home Improvement, a swimmer in "Baywatch", a playboy, the wife of an annual musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be Miss Maria in a special Christmas series of Canadian television.
The private TV station CTV today announced that Anderson will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, with sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known as Internet-based porn videos, will appear with his former husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as the Lady Maria holding in the little doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen.
Krome Anderson and Peterse will present a Canadian singer, Bublé, who married Louisano Lopilato, an Argentine model in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York's "person".
Japan returns to life after an earthquake
HDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the period of fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now being driven by a global earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have estimated material losses to $300 billion, an injury that despite the difficult global situation is well known.
After three quarters of the fall, the HDP value between July and September was in such a position that it was possible with the definitive validity to reverse the page: HDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year beginning in March 2012 - also predict the maximum rate of growth compared to the period of January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly possible to explain the purchase of machinery necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending decreases by 0.9% over the period from ice to ice. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes only from a impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis in order to get out of it or to restore infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This change has increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Significance
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saved values" for investors who run away from the euro area debt crisis and from the worrying forecasts of the United States. It is a privilege that is, at the same time, a great burden for exporting companies.
The stronger the currency is the products abroad, which is negative for the country, whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their poor results in July until September.
While markets continue to occupy EU border countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen," the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts instability in the world economy has shown that the main power economy is slowing down.
It decreased by four tenths to 100,4 points to 100,8 in August.
The Eurozone even reached the average of 100. It reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Uncertainty
Papadimos says there will be a positive response, but the conservatives will not sign a written commitment.
With the rapid and risky territorial guarantees and the uncertainty that again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in the maze leading to an exit from a major debt crisis in Europe.
The view that the "judgment" of the new transitional Greek government is given to Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, admitted that there was no alternative to structural reform and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new supportive measures would in no way support and repeat his requirement to write new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will take place tomorrow by voting on the government's confidence.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not explain any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the help of the Transitional Government, but we have not committed anything else."
The president of the Conservatives went a little further to the EU and the IMF. These organisations have to block 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time declared that it will not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the resistance measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, which has already been affected by Papandre's play with the referendum, stressed that its requirements are irrefutable: it does not block any aid unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign a "written commitment without duplication and as soon as possible".
Speaking for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors will return "very quickly" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek friar has just a moment left of what.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Kingdom raises Spain's main position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "have achieved a significant position at the global level with regard to microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become a second donor to the planet, as far as this tool of cooperation is concerned, "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
Last night, the Queen launched the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid, convinced that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation is "very necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about fulfilling the goals that are to achieve a reduction in the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, that is, the amount that sets the threshold for poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsible", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended above all.
"We've already reached a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The sum of micro-loans should be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that it was the goal of 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and of 100 million families to the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloan was extended to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what the head of Muhammad Yunus thought on this road," the queen said, and added that it was a "act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as "a wonderful idealist who went on the way to fight poverty." She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first worldwide summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the 1999 Slovene Coast in Canada, were followed after this experience. "In all these meetings I was able to discover constant development, the Queen explained that, thanks to her support for this project, she earned the title "family head" last night, which gave her in Valladolid "the movement of the poor".
Queen Sofie arranged her performance by urging participants to engage in discussion and search for solutions and thus enabled them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative", which all democratic states must manage.
In this sense, she said that it would be wrong to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the balloon habitat, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez is believed to be a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever the governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to become a victim of crime.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State Secrets for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people who are all closing the door. Starosta Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city who "opens their gates of the spirit of solidarity which is infectious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general voting rights
Without serious difficulties for the office and president of the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkel, the first day of the Christian-Democracy Union (CDU) Congress took place on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it became until the fall, in particular to be satisfied by the members who consider the government's policy to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians as lax tomorrow.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates objected and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of sheep stands at the end of Angely Merkel's performance and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the office and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: it responds to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to officials in Europe, "the time has come for change".
This could be expressed by amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the convention's proposal, which is clearly the inspiration of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all the twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against the British and CDU leaders, Nicolas Sarkozy also thinks the same attitude will be taken.
But the direction is out.
Likewise, delegates refused a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's representation, depending on the weight of its economy, which would clearly lead to the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
She was led to calm the climate inside her side, the office made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to get a conference on the "small" of European states or on States that are in difficulty willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
The proposal on Europe is, however, devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", not quoted by Angela Merkel's France.
It's just not fair.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in working disability?
The UMP party and the government of the offensive against incapacity for work are supported.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address the topic of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is intended to make savings in the context of increased urgency, but is not less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of incapacity before they start receiving support in the disease.
Clearly, without the agreement of the company, the employee who is sick would lose four days of pay, at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
And also the measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic achievement: to give public employees one day of unrestricted disability (until now they have no disability against three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority will also go along with the subject of fraud this time on the ill-treatments associated with job failures.
"The controls will be much more extensive and further: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat inappropriate in view of the truth of irregularities in the event of incapacity for work.
These were in fact the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance disease (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 daily refunds amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were maternal contributions and labour losses and 54% were job failures, i.e. €6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the health costs.
According to the study by Alma Consulting, France had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which conceals certain derogations: another survey published in 2007 on the work opportunities pages of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that no day of disability had been chosen.
Another study, this time carried out by non-patient insurance institutions, makes it clear that in 2010 37.8% of disability was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% went on.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more than prone to inability to work elsewhere.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incapacitating in the workplace is only a very small part of the opposite of black work.
In the case of fraud, these are just a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on disability for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that in 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of the 285,000 were performed due to short-term incapacity for "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled disability of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were estimated at 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million employees who had disabilities.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to MPP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the year-on-year selection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to rebuild its economy again.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos presented those words to Parliament and added that a hundred days given by his government will not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To put our economy back on foot, we need support from our European partners and a new saving budget plan," the head of government said on Wednesday when he found his first public speech at the start of the debate on voting on confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as it added the participation of our country in the euro area in the game.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "about 9%" of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right to refuse new supportive measures
On Monday, the Justice Leader, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support with an approved measure to try to avoid the debt crisis, but noted that his party did not commit itself to any additional supportive measure.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed the meeting with the Members on his side of New Democracy.
We have set out targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating flooding, but we are against any policy that would defend economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantee to all the parties supporting the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, the committee of experts says
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians were killed.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and so on in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of opening up death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make a decision in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government change the criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this choice is deemed necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the experts quote a recent survey by independent agencies of Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada was 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die in a home that has a majority of Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
As far as the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide is concerned, the authors of the reports come to the conclusion that they are against the position of the federal government that has already said that the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also subject all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides against persons who do not belong or disagree.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downe, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases at a teleconference yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Adequate suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are attracted to euthanasia
Consider that according to an Angus Reid's 2010 study, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of old or disabled people has a lower price.
With regard to persons engaged in assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of care for the patient, the situation is less clear, reports authors say.
The list of recommendations also suggests that the criminal law states that a derogation from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional physicians be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fear of a criminal offence.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and so on in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia, and to subject it to the same procedures.
Remuneration of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report by the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the experts-signatories of the report as "extreme", inter alia, because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia at the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation when anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide," says Pierre Descamps, who was studying summary reports yesterday.
P. Deshamps also argues that it appears that the authors of the reports have built autonomy of persons above all other values that create a social prejudice of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also said "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "manifist for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly suspicious of the data on the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the American state of Oregon.
The Jordan King calls on President Assad to resign
The lady's talking about "complexity"
Syria is more isolated
Yesterday, Bashar al-Assad's supporters protested before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who supported them with Russian support and spoke of "complexity" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union increased its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring country, took a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad.
Jordanian King Abdullah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday, who called for President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed "before power".
"If Bashar had any interest in his country, he would have to give a demo, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu said that the efforts made by the Turkish media in the Syrian regime which had been established since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with an attack on neighbouring Syria, which Turkey applies as much as the line goes.
The United States was pleased to see the "enhancement of consensus against Assad and the wrong conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying the more hard tone" to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed "by gunshots and concentrated shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobbar" in the area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualm estimated that the country "was on the way out of the crisis".
He has also responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend the membership of Damascus, which he believes is a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not withdraw", added with the assurance that "complexes against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to withdraw the Syrian membership, the League of Arab States currently considers "the mechanism for the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also welcomed the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he considered to be "paranoidly".
The new special meeting of the League is called to Rabat tomorrow to raise its opinion on the plan for a resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which included in particular the deployment of armed forces from the cities of armed conflict and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the decision of the League of Arab States to be "missible" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while protecting itself from any possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for some time to be able to design his team and start applying a program that will contain "victims" to regain the confidence lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting with representatives of experts and employers.
It should be composed of a relatively smooth cabinet composed of technocrats other than parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups of participants in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini photo gallery expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express confidence on Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti representing the small team of twelve ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented nervously on the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy pays precise terms" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understanding".
Its appointment as president was initially favourable, but anxiety reappeared after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team including, above all, technocrats, even though he stressed that he would like to adopt "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President, the new government of Gianfranca Fini will receive Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency after his departure, and with the aim of re-establishing Italy as a strong article in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speech stressed that "and with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that in spite of the difficult plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new strong measures.
The head of the ConfIndustria Emma Marcegagliová business union, which meets with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy again "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the "resistance challenge" and "other Italy", is a "local change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great unknown time will be the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place public bonds by April 2012 at EUR 200 billion.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapons, announced in Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specialising in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency.
Last week, MAAE announced its "serious concern" with regard to the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute of Widespread Documents, V. Danilenko (nar. 1934) had been working three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Čeljabinska (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the centre to set up a "nano-diamanty" company in Kyiv.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, MAAE recalls "the clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" came from "the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of its work career on this technology in the framework of the country's military nuclear programme from where it came from".
Protimoslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased or decreased slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase in the treatment of 13% in Catholic violence, 4% in Jewish offences and 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "insensible criminal acts" was very easy on 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which according to the FBI were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the 2009 stay, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and decency to stop again," the Human Rights First organization stressed with regard to human rights, "the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leading actors of the Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "individual criminal acts".
"Immortal crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the period of struggle for civil law.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service page introduced a change in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of the followers, somewhat similar to her Facebook service.
New offers "activities" and "name" allow you to better and get to know the activities of other people who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") follow you.
This allows you to know whether they can monitor contributions, whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday," said the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was familiar with its little instinctive function, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated expansion of someone else's contribution, followfriday to recommend a different user) making the bonus des initiés, so open a wider audience with a more comparable handling and that of des reseaux grand public Facebook and Google+.
On the user's network, their "tweets" are different to the importance of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Working will help me better watch some of the elements of my Twitter," @danykronstrom sent.
Austria
entering a golden rule on the balance of the budget in the institution
The government of large coalitions of social Democrats and Christian Democrats, who are in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down a "gold rule" budget policy in the institution with a view to reducing public deficit and avoiding such a reduction in the assessment of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the only social-democratic office Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial advice in a situation where the Austrian public debt is, with its 74.6% high above the criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay every year for three billion euros," argued the multi-cancer and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus calls for the euro area summit to be held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that public deficit reduction and the balance of public accounts be recorded in the Constitution or in the law by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to be reduced annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be expected to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the country as well as the foreigners will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to achieve a public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
The node threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to reinstate on foreign exchange markets if only to continue to strengthen.
"Let's do as we've done the last time, if we find too much inconsistencies" in the exchange course alone, he explained to Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, only again came to the historical values that were forced by the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
That day, Tokyo was sold only for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which had recently exceeded the record of the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since then has there been regular support for the purchases of investors who consider him a "safe port" in the early days of world economic slowdown and a European debt crisis.
The dollar came back on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro fell under a symbolic summer of 105 yen to the close of the level that was the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This development of Japanese currency harms island exports because it distorts the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they transfer them to domestic currency.
"Japan is ravaged" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunamis that devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, highlighted Y. Noda, who is afraid that this disaster will not just kill in the island of the crucifixion.
The third economic strength of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and first in one year due to the export growth survey and the consumption of households affected by disasters.
But the Prime Minister ruled that the high value did not reflect the "Japanese national economy".
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched its political and monetary councils Tuesday to adopt all possible measures leading to a weakening.
But the multi-government of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already adopted "particular measures" which meant that no additional monetary weakening could be expected in the middle.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the institution for securities issues increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of state cash notes and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchases of various securities with a view to cash flow.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fall
The risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to grow.
European storms are still concerned about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday, 15 November, falling into negative expectations.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points in 10 hours.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the revenues from the euro area state loans that are in difficulty, the world-wide stock markets continue to produce only a part of the recent profit."
"Nursing investors are only too aware of the risk of injury," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by the Agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed down by 0.7%, which suffered from the fears of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes focused on Europe, and the change will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyosi Investment Management.
This re-starting does not affect the future of the eurozone itself, which continues in its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level from month to month.
In 10 hours, the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at a drop of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency failed after the party of the CDU office of Angely Merkelov, at its congress, adopted on Monday a proposal that would provide for the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries experiencing difficulties without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
Today, in the autumn, the Italian ten-year bond yield is 6.85% and the Spanish ten-year bond yield is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the growth rate of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded that he adjust the situation in Italy with the poison caused by the higher debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit would be his government's "main task".
Spain is again in the targeted market direction when the country's elections are held on Sunday in the MP's studio.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting the number of reporting growth in the euro area
Statistics say that in the third quarter, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the number below for the second quarter down by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is, it's the fourth quarter that the economies worry the most.
Germany has recorded a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts have to win over the dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term differences or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural for the elections to be an opportunity to think about such investments and about the place that takes power from the core.
The debate will only succeed when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development has led to a double demand for electricity from 2050 to 2050, if we do not want to save a significant part of the world's population from the important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and we cannot forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is the subject of environmental debate at present.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case, however, in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find another resource capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which only considers to be the right building of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit refurbishing the construction of one power plant interrupted by the Three Mile Island power plant.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
Berlin's election is reflected in the reduction of electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a rapid increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of land and coal plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European wind energy champion, which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are higher than 65%, or 50%, than the European average.
On the contrary, due to the uncertainty of our energy policy, our neighbor's electricity bill will be paid by 40% higher than the amount paid by the French households.
While in a globalised energy cost economy, the key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry in the national territory is that the French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make the illustrative beautiful declaration of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as it does not essentially oppose this energy, as public opinion surveys show.
Remember, our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
A strong export sector will attract a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises, which cannot be transferred abroad, to the international markets.
If France had decided to abandon the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have come at EUR 6 billion a year, which the country will receive for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which owner of the power plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years, while planning the collapse of its manufacturer?
The solution to the energy equation should be allowed to assume that there is no magical source for energy production, although there is no devil.
The development of low CO2 production facilities, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations implemented by the French industrial group AREVA shall testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the National Nuclear Safety Authority, which performs non-compromised and transparent supervision over existing nuclear power plants as well as over the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionality is recognized, have a sense of security in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
The only thing in Three Mile Island has happened under normal operating conditions and has remained without human victims and consequences for the environment.
In Montenegro, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and irrevocable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the disaster was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take training from this disaster just as he did in the two previous years.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor represents a concept capable of responding to such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to be an excellent gift to the competitors of the AREVA group and EDF and to free up the way to strengthen the leading position in the nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our countries, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmates and machines control the debate so that the economic, social and financial situation of our country will prevail.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised by various angles - the counting of police, courts and administrations of detailed policies of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" in France.
Recently it was an administrative burden, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération letter of 23 May) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, landowners and servants".
But so far, it was only a small part of the economy.
It must be said that in this area there is a fairly wide agreement between the left and the right.
That's exactly what Jacques Chirac said in 1976 that "9000000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "could not accept all the world's moments".
The only difference is the degree of magnitude
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the horde of Polish installers in the French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of greatness that we will refrain from providing to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande restricts the banality when it turns out that common development can solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesising the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than pensioners for French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to provide jobs.
Positive effect on wages
Like a surgeon, there will be difficulties with work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between France and migrants cause the income of immigrants to have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the development of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
In European countries, migrants have also contributed an average of 1% of the total budget to social systems.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany one immigrant will bring a net contribution (receiving minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 for his entire life in public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his term of office that he wished to come for the missing percentage of growth "with valued teeth".
The said teeth used to detect immigrants had a very different effect.
Europe came from democracy, left to think of European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, gulags, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that if democracy definitely triumphed over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and make it as direct as possible.
But it's known since Napoleon that it's about the ease of thinking.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become "a tool for printing" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of division and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we live in is an economic crisis, but it is just as from the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the error of the Greek referendum of type yes-no will have in this direction the value of double disclosure: the need for a great return of political power, but also the discovery of a disturbing sense of his inability, his incompatibility.
This ambiance must be considered so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of the democratic attack has moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we demand a number of national referents organized according to necessity and disorganized.
White exposed to European absolutist monarch or jump with tied legs to empty nationalist depths: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know where to stop the report - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is therefore the whole of Europe that stands before the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from their inability and lack of solidarity.
It is, therefore, Europe as a whole, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are disappointed in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it all its nations.
It is urgent that the European project of democratic sovereignty be restored.
Because only together will the Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the governments of markets and prepare for the future by investment.
The outcome of the crisis will be a decision at European level, which will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would bring us to ruin.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all of us today are demanding the European economic government.
Wake up.
But think about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such a citizen, would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to be a Republican.
The revolution in the interests of that could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Unplugged" chips are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere it will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world fair of chip cards.
In 2011, Eurosmart’s office said that it was expected to end up increasing global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is a non-contact technology segment that allows you to pay for joint transport or to purchase only by approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
In 2012, their share was expected to rise (expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total market with chips cards (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the way of APEC countries, Europe receives the land in a non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, there are smaller beginnings: 400,000 visas were issued without contact.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus released 2.5 million wireless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to rank a higher speed level, it is necessary to have their clients dispose of them from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients a free bank card," said Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment mobile
But that's just the first step towards the payment facility of the future: mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is only a small number of devices available today.
"They're late."
"But they should come to their real demise next year."
"We estimate their sales worldwide for 2012 to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Bank of Crédit agriculturale announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will take place from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices will provide about 200 clients and employees with an exclusive payment without contact.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Society General announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay for their mobile phone wirelessly.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaydo in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are links between the Al-Qayda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "no certainty" since now.
"The way both organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help clarify the bridges.
After AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their kidnappings during the operation by special French units.
In the morning after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
An analysis of the calls made leads to a number of people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is a collaborator of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but there is no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and performance of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which currently involve human victims or an increasingly complex explosive device of the same manner of implementation as the devices used by AQMI.
The international community in front of Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems of Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be of little interest to the community of mystics.
Speed of success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "western education is a sin", approves the establishment of Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link is a quick success.
The sect is politicizing and demanding strict observance of Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are beginning to fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram troops became extremely active and fuelled their attacks on police stations.
The government's response is usually the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Joseph sect is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its activities in the north.
On Christmas 2010 he will perform an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will be killed, followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police commander in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local government will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, is now disturbing all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qayda Islamic Maghreb surrounds Mali and games and Somalis from Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a conversation with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of urgency and is prepared to "pass over all the information".
The World According to Candidates to the President
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are exacerbated in simplicity and ignorance.
Can America manage a weakened world using simple or even simplistic ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating a horrendous statement and specific instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republic.
The often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or the help of Israel come together.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the competition for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened the Chinese's call to the World Trade Organisation and their charge of "for the manipulation of their currency", which is the bare theme of America's determined migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this has to contain the launch of a trade war in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obama to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost collapsed in a position that "records" emotions.
He demanded a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last seats in the polls, remains unobtrusive.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if they failed to succeed in halting his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," said the fanfaron.
"If Obama's elected again, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel's military aid, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacities" - obviously unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Protesters of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the defeated "boys" departure from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya, and thus attach a weak label to it.
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Ládina, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military forces that lead to a coup.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild economic America in order to be able to reinvigorate its leading position, Obama clings to the right place.
Nord Stream, new port of entry of Russian gas to Europe
The far-off Nord Stream pipeline, which is directly affecting Eastern Europe in Russia and led by the Baltic Sea, began to function.
They have to add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas station, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday in the opening of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly to the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkelová, Russian President Dmitrij Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte surrounded the Russian gas pipeline in the western European network.
This new pipeline starts to flow 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year with the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the Petrohradu region with the Mecklenburg-Pomāran co-country.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will be able to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same track.
For Gazprom, the temporary completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The image of these two countries is losing some power: the possibility of pressing Russia at the risk of closing access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
The most powerful statement was made by Warsaw when she did not dare to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-World Pact", with a call for an alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security of its purchases.
But it is at the price of a weakening Europe of energy, because the project created markets between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia managed to spread its vision of a direct link between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, which is approaching its end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new carpet that connects us organically," said François Fillon in celebrating the opening of this pipeline and demonstrating where large gas contracts are both political and economical.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas pipeline.
The construction of this pipeline is also a significant technical act.
The underwater pipes are of steel fitted with concrete to protect them from seagoing vessels.
It is located at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
His building had to be avoided by mine fields from the time of World War II.
"Because of their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
The measures for the protection of fauna and flora were also needed.
The single tube is a long metal snake weighing 242 Effelove, which is not interrupted anywhere throughout its length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control area was to be built near Sweden, but the project leader refused it, when the Swedish were only a little eager to see the Russian state company, as it is constantly located at their shores.
"In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of unhappiness, the gas contained in the pipeline will be avoided in the air.
But this case is considered to be a very unlikely case, since the weights were designed to cause nausea once in 100,000 years.
Control of the state of gas pipeline outside is carried out by the underwater robot of the ship while the inside gas pipeline is controlled by the equipment that is circulating inside.
This tube-shaped device of an average diameter of 1 m is inserted inside the tube and is pressed by gas.
Within three days of the journey, the speed 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on any deformation of the metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without the need for a smaller repair.
Gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The lead position remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxes are extremely beneficial.
As a result, Gazprom leased all its gas transport capacity for five years, which can be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a total capacity gain, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was provided by 30% of the shareholders and by 70% of the bank loans.
The total labour costs should reach €7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that their costs will be returned, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The river leads out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sand coast with pine forests.
The valves are 4.5 metres high and form the exhaust gate.
The recorders shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas coming before being transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been accepting one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When the full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Tagger
The Italian company Moleskina, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to re-supply the writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, an hour spent writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine recorder is easily recognizable by its black desks and its leaves sent white colors as if they were old.
The writer of Moleskin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Mode Mode resident in Milan will then decide to place a new design but distinguished writer on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes note of the introduction of the new product.
The pen is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used for example to adjust the surface of the bench.
This type of recorder was highly appreciated by the writer and traveller.
"Moleskine returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became the leading person of the fashion brand.
It's a success here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to accommodate 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 recorders were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to make up some artistic portrait of the buyer, because the writer will take on business as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has today almost a hundred, and since 2008, it has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his recorders to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain of stores into small shops in the middle of cities where he was able to spread his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the author Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Acházka", where architects or artists present their writer.
In August, at the occasion of a film festival in Locarnu, she also introduced a new record record recorder that reminds Leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, bags, pendants on notebooks ... The brand extends to a whole range of carriers.
The success that sparked addiction: In the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was purchased by SG Capital Europe investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskina.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today, it opens 15. Weeks for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that adorable?
"No, it's undermining Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the employment of disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"It wasn't a percentage of unemployed twice at the time, but three times higher."
"There's nothing left to do about it."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons, there are many obstacles to their approach to work.
This is about older people: 37% is over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have maturity, and only 10,000 of 2.3 million students in high school are disabled.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, on average, 38%.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the "core problem", according to Christian Grapina, Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses to receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly developing, but too slowly.
The study carried out in April by IMS-Entreprere pour la Cité found that the questionnaire managers have "a low level of knowledge about disabled persons" with a "overreached idea of persons in the wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the objectives of employment of 6% of the employed workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 show a figure of 2.6%.
"Now we are moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph's organization, responsible for selecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "acquired" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 of the provinces to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with between 20 and 49 employees employ ment workers against 82% of enterprises with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "How lucky."
Before Tuesday evening (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We don't go that far to write that there was sex between them, but the picture is symbolic.
The sittings next to themselves at the court view of Stade de France were briefly and well addressed by Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am with Eden and his progress is very happy, and the truth is that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," guarantees the French Lille player.
In terms of the difference between his performances in the club games and the national men's games, "that's the same thing, he's justifying himself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my badge."
Hazard, a Romanian on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "warn".
He can't mention the notion of joy.
To play against Bleus, who has been encouraging for 7 years and in their winning prizes in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More than that, because they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed right away."
"You can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Kindly, Leekens even mentioned pride.
"Hredst" to fight "fighting" is a celebration.
"Hrdost" also found in the quality of "soseds", that France became a very high-level team after more than a year of trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a great piece of work," he sighed.
Perhaps Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with France direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You'll be aware of this for future battles," including against France.
Portugal very self-aware
The Portuguese watch Paulo Bento starts with a great optimism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there were both teams missing realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football representation, with its corms since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is in fact 90 minutes away from luck.
There is one match and one match - Bosnia.
In the knowledge of the Friday result (0-0) in the Hell of the Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing has been saved.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's worth of weight, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that he would take.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't go out."
But at home at their wonderful Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will appear before the audience, who should create a hot tub there, even though the match is definitely "very balanced", says the optimist, but very considerate Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have a proposal," said a twenty-four-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroze.
An unsolved Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to give goals and win.
A decisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't go out," says Bento.
"We will be playing against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Like in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
