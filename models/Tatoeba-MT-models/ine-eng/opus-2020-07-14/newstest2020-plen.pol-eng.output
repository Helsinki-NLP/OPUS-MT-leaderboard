Joseph Wyko’s father: I saw Jesus in the white room
He's a charismatic.
The holy Mass of liberation and healing, which he instituted, draws the crowds.
He was a couple of years old when things began to get unexplained in his life.
Today, through Franciscanine, others experience this.
To the blessed by o. Wikko Mass of St. about the liberation and healing of the crowds
At one time, the father of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be surgery.
Joseph Witko's father prayed about him.
On the same day the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The strange doctor said, "The operation is not required, the dead body is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were so happy.
After another prayer, Franciscanine disappeared completely.
The Creator has begun to experience extraordinary spiritual activities as a teenager.
In his fasts, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awakened at night and compelled to pray for the dead and for those who died at that time — a reminder.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what would happen to a man who would commit the sins of the dead.
"My body began to change.
I lost the human characteristics and started to take the look of the animal," he says.
The invisible force took him up, he couldn't get a voice out of himself.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"Saturated in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the holy, I was released and returned to the human form...," he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
He's got a call.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not only want to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community Resumption of the Holy Spirit
In the health care tables of the father Witko will be attended by many people who count on the release of the disease.
However, the spiritual one emphasizes that their primary purpose is spiritual healing, not physical.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today's (26 September no.) afternoon team Kolpinga FRAC was awarded the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superligi Table Tennis.
Jaroslaving in such a personal set as they presented with the tombs has no chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He showed this one with Dart Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps a third of the triumphs in the new season would be accompanied by a jaroslaving composition.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown to win with such poems as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most prospective Poles, the Badow Mark.
The winner of Hellady was the largest single star in the MOSiR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both at the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC was running 2:1.
Kou Lei probably won Mark Badowski, and Daniel Goroak after an emotional, five - year - old battle – Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could have hoped for a two-point victory, but Qiyao Han didn't become a Badowska.
There will be no further studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Raphał Trzasksky, a programme of free prophylactic studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and is subject to the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
For reasons, the agency explained that the target group was badly selected.
“These actions may affect the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to an increase in the difficulty of accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with the false positive outcome of the studies”, it says.
The resort's decisions don't understand the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predicted money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is just to lead to a situation where prevention can be made more quickly.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and the sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," Rafael Trzaskowski said.
"I find it hard to imagine that running specialists are saying, 'Let's not try, because there will be longer courses with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that there's a health service in that condition,' the PO added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreement with Israel if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's decree on the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, as it is going to be, comes to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he ordered.
"We completely reject the whole plan," he threatened Abbas with pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – little of what will happen – by engaging fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, again received a government-forming mission after the 17 September elections.
A week before the elections, he ordered that if he wins, he announces the annex to the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States sponsored.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold a general election in Palestinian lands.
They were last held in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, considered as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to benefit from the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all respect for the provisions of the United Nations".
The Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "will focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy directed against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership".
However, Danon, as the agencies say, did not refer to the annexes of the occupied Palestinian lands promised by Netanjah.
Warriors want defibrillators at the nerve points of the Industry
The history of the border crossing shows that an AED automatic defibrillator can save human life.
The Voivodship Station of the Rattunk Warehouse in Industry wants such equipment to be found at the city’s neurological points.
For their position, the officials received congratulations from the Vyvojvodjska Ratunkovska Pototio in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, former Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wöjcik is the official of the Podkarpackic Office of Treasure Fees in Mind.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukraine border crossing in Medica. The official of the Customs-Skarb Service noticed a man lying unconscious in the area of walking.
The Chinese activist died in a prison for torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, an activist's wife, on 23 September, the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village called to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In Cao's temple, she saw a man's body slaughtered, not to be recognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says the woman.
"They didn't let me take a cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a "successful accident".
105 million zł for companies in the video game industry from the National Research and Development Centre
Nearly 105 million zł funding hits companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on a real-world real-world real-world game engine, together with an application for the transmission of data by users; a testing-school platform for the verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional excellence using VR and AI technology; an innovative game for managing real-time production processes using a innovative model of development based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real-world using the concept of industry 4.0 – given in the Communication of NCBR sent to PAP on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video-game producers on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was 1.85 billion zł and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already 300 million zł support for entrepreneurs under this sector programme is an important incentive for further, dynamic growth of Polish gaming," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The Government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as B+R facilities, excellence programmes, IP box or NCBR support programmes, encourage innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market," the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication, assesses.
The head of the science resort points out that money for innovation not only affects innovations in the form of project financing, but also remains in their pockets – from the B+R facility in 2018, three-quarters more entrepreneurs than a year ago.
‘The estimated costs for B+R activities amounted to 1.7 billion zł, giving more than 300 million złm of savings for companies benefiting from this facility.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three editions of GameINN," the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
Director of the NCBR Dr. Ojciech Kamienecki also recalls that 78 innovative projects have been awarded over 211.2 million in two previous co-financing tenders.
The huge interest in competition III and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly gratifying that there are projects on solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million zł could be requested by entrepreneurs, the consortium of entrepreneurs and the consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
For the NCBs, 87 applications for the total amount of funding amounted to approximately 317 million zł.
The tender budget at the time of the invitation to tender amounted to 100 million zł, but was increased, with 27 projects allocated almost 105 million zł.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN competition III is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing the watch of Kasper Dolberg
The event took place on 16 September.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajaksa Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, focused on training that his watch had disappeared from the barn.
They're not cool, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish the next day didn't show up in the classrooms, translating into stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
The footballers in the barn have private safes available, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he was granted a theft at the end of Diaby-Fadiga.
At 18 years of age, he apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised Denmark to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 30-year-old to get his first team three years later.
This season was held in seven matches.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper "L'Equipe" said, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
At this point, the disciplinary procedure was initiated against his predecessor.
Nice, at least officially, will reject comments on this matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of infections, you need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands to a sufficient degree.
And most of us are short!
Just warm water and regular soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors are treating it).
By washing, we wash not only the bottoms and the tops of the hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (joined or individually) – cut them with the wheels of the inside of the second hand, the space between the fingers (prepayment of the hands, cutting the fingers by itself), the fingers – each finger we cover with the second hand and in such a hug we turn to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hand) we should shake your hand with a wet brush and then use an antibacterial gel (in dregs, 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hand-washed pads or doors (the recommendation of the Health Inspector General).
Open it through the paper manual.
President of Iran says he has rejected the US talks, Donald Trump rejects
Tehran did not hold talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US's offer of sanctions, President Hasan Rowhani announced on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that this is an Iranian side that requested the removal of the restrictions that he did not agree to.
According to President Hasan Rowhani, the United States has proposed the abolition of all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for the adoption of negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile construction programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to take these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He stated that he met with American diplomats because he was appointed by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not take talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
On the day before, the Iranian leader said he was not excluding talks with the United States, and he accused European parties of supporting US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the United States had entered into a nuclear agreement "with an initial condition that did not allow" to be linked to the dialogue.
If we are able to cope with this initial condition and if America is going to suffer sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with the President of the United States, Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation during the next week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian side request.
"Iran wanted me to bear the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" the U.S. president insisted.
Voltage with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some way to save an agreement with Iran from 2015, which was signed by the signatories.
It decided that, in exchange for the abolition of Iran's economic sanctions, it would withdraw from the nuclear-weapon-building programme and that the nuclear sector would be subject to the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed their wish to maintain the agreement in force.
There's no way out of it at the moment.
Washington is using the maximal pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Teheran said that if he does not receive permission to export the raw material, he would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement by 60 days.

The Court of Justice of the Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emitria, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsApp, participated in the trial against the judges, was brought back to the ground by the NSA.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to support the administration of the WSA Wojciech Mazura to remove him from duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary speaker at the NSA, initiated an action against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not yet been turned against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take the decision of the President of the US within a month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge who publicly told his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office from the Heterian Group because of suspicions of participation in the Heterian Group, returned to the ground and issued judgments on behalf of the Polish Police.
Judge Smydt denies his participation in the Heterian Group.
He claims that he has no evidence of this except for the false screens and the words of his wife who divorces him.
That is exactly what the other judges say: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't push her finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, he also silenced the contents of the phone Emilii Smydt, which was the phone that kept in June in another case.
The police didn't kiss the finger to protect the devices of the people he was after in the case of Judge Waldemar Žurek last February.
There's no evidence – there's no Smydt case, there's no "Kasty" case.
Also, there is no case of chief NIC Marian Banasia renting a stone to the sinks and concealing income.
The CBA shall verify its financial statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will not take part in the Banas Commission because the Sejm has been suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow come together to take a decisive decision on the removal of the representatives of Banasia and the appointment of its legislator, although the law does not provide for such a forward-looking combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake, about how a wife comes home and stops her husband with a lover in bed.
She's so surprised and confused she can't express her words.
She's standing in the door open, and at the time the lover jumps out of bed, she's dressed and out.
And my husband's got a bed.
When a wife regains her voice and cries out: "What is this to be?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, what kind of woman, honey?
It's just that in the case of Casty or Banasia, it's about the state parade.
And that's not funny at all.

In the end, I will have to jump more technically," she admitted to the Eurosport camera Ličwinko.

Cornell Morawiecki is in a hospital in a difficult state
He went to the hospital, and his doctors define his condition as severe.
You have to add that he's conscious.
"We believe that it will come out of this, that it will win again.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close person to Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with the Super Express journalists.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running to the Senate.
"My closest family and politics are keeping me alive," said Cornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave two weeks ago to the Super Express journalist.
In January "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Cornell Morawiecki had been studying at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I experienced strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
It turns out I have a yellow spot.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a computer tomographer was surveyed, it was found that I had a new bite...," the Prime Minister said.
A few days later at MSViA Hospital in Warsaw, Cornell Morawiecki went through a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Dud sent his own personal chaplain, Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours, and it went well.
"I know that a lot of people have prayed for me because I am very grateful.
Luckily, I don't have any breaks.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to doctors of specialists who are rather good at thinking.
I have to go back to some state of use after this difficult operation.
I hope everything will be okay," said Cornel Morawiecki in January in the conversation with the "SE".
"If I were to be able to study too late, it would be tragic and I would be grateful to this fall..." he added.
Kraków: 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Kraków are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stoklosa.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is invited to contact.
The 26th of September, she left her place of residence and did not return to the present time, nor did she connect with her loved ones.
The last time I saw her was at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, measuring 167 cm, has blonde hair and gray-haired eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in blue, gray under and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is requested to contact the police under number 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of lead jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports professions, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15th on the hypodrome on Oleandra Street in Oław, may be for some mistaken.
To the real power of the road is far away, but that's the way one of the kind of horse rivalry is defined...
The race of the jumps lies in the defeat of the rider and the horse of the ever higher obstacles that in the most prestigious international professions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still unpopular record of the world, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olaw, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also the worst...
The trades organised by the unscrupulous Jan Sienkiewicz and other operators of the JKS ‘In the saddle’, were a part of the earlier ‘Integral barley trades’, which we write in this issue on page 22.
There were eight Amazons training in the Olivévé in the JKS.
Four competed on hips and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra was best written, adding to the crazy Sprinter.
This small, but what a dynamic belt began to overcome the obstacles at 40 cm and ended only at the station with a top white distance from the ground at 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals was the competition jury removed from the competition.
Amelia Pawlak, "Fami", and Lena Borunj's third on "Harmider", took the second place in the jumps.
The youngest participant in the tournament - Inga Aksman, who is galloping and jumping through obstacles to the "Carmen" cry.
Even greater emotions have accompanied the starting Amazons and see during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible losses were estimated by Paulina Szewczyk, who was a "Declaration" and Anastasia Abrahammenko, who was on the "Lotce".
Luckily, there's nothing wrong with the little kisses, the Amazons, and the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of a young "Wineta" cry on the park had to be added to it by Veronika Lückiewicz.
She needed either a coach assistant or another horse to the pair, and she had a little crazy "Wineta".
After counting the barrier from the park, she also went full-blown, so moments in the boxes and at the diners became dangerous. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down some of the scary sights, especially those young ones.
From the start of the competition of the big horses, Marta Masalska has been a great place in the park, which is a beautiful "Whisky".
This worthy, in a pair of experienced Amazons, in the second approach in the final phase, first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at the time.
After the same height, however, Paulina Szewczyk was also counted as "Declaration", Heronika Lüczkiewicz as "Winece" and Anastasia Abrahammenko as "Lotce".
Thus, all these racers went out together to decoration the fleet and after receiving the goods prizes in the form of a barber's equipment, and finally, together with the amazons on the wheels of the Radecki march, they performed an effective round of honors, ending these interesting and exciting professions.
Thank you.
The Jäzdäcki Sport Club "In Siodle" is cordially thanks to the sponsors of the competition for the power of jump during the XVI "Intensities of Jäzdäckých": the City Office in Oław, the Water and sewerage plant in Oław, the Old Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko withdraws from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal, in particular, to young voters on legal views.
Before the election, Kolonko ordered cooperation with Mark Jakubiak, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions did happen, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko was unable to even collect enough signatures to display the lists in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed Twitter that he had finished co-operation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'm going to expect from KWW to delete my name.
He would welcome my person's non-connection with the entity in question," he added and ordered more information soon.
At the moment it is not known whether the journalist will continue to act, whether it is the end of the formation of #R Revolution.
On July 4, American Independence Day, U.S. journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has heard of the release of a Max TV YouTube channel on which he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It was time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The Party's programme included matters relating to the judiciary (to be chosen in general elections), tax changes (comparation of tax-free amounts for all), war repairs (as military aid for the countries of the eastern NATO, with particular regard to Poland), referendum on the possession of weapons, the reduction of arms or the introduction of uniform electoral circles.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the conversation with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko placed information on his profile in the social media suggesting that #R will connect forces to the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally arrived.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro course will last for the next few months in the vicinity of trap 4,35 zł, so that there will be a weak economy in global markets," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Health Management.
"The expectation of maintaining a steady pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy is talking about stabilising gold notations in the current trap," a specialist in the conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure of the Monetary Policy Council, the Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are making policy easier.
“If gold is properly valued – euro ratings should be maintained within the next months in the vicinity of cap 4,35 zł – there are so little attractive Polish bonds according to it.
Much more cost-effective than Polish papers offer bonding from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of the market allocation in the UBS Health Management company.
According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's economy.
"The global slowdown can still be deepened, but it should not come to a severe recession, and at the top of the GDP dynamics is slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investants should be afraid of global actions that may damage the prospect of a solution to a trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump and Brexit impeachment procedure.
Europe should be relatively weak among the stock markets," the latest list for investors by the UBS Health Management Director Mark Haefele is the latest.
"The euro area shares should be treated worse than the US because they are more vulnerable in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowing down," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the housing in the markets of the most secure countries has affected the profitability of Germany for 10 years even less than 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen the profitability decline.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term and short-term securities should no longer be reduced by slowing the monetary policy of banks.
The biggest field to lower feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the next year's horizon.
The long-term balance sheet for euro banknotes is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19-percent potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further decreases in Fed's feet, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
"The long-term maintenance of the dollar can prevent current and budgetary deficits," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehrea loses its weapons.
Trust the German MON report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19,445 ammunition – resulting from the secret composition of the RFN defence resource.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the Media EditoriesNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office, the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far been able to re-detect two weapons, one weapons and 3474 ammunition.
Among the military equipment that remains lost are six MG3, 11 G3, four G36 automatic carabines, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing for MG3 machine carabines.
The vice-president of the Lewic Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
According to RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “continuing”.
Moreover, only a part of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigations.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as "necessary balances".
She also criticised the fact that the composition did not show whether there were any weapons found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor of Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing a campaign for German policy with extremely legal and racist incentives.
His "black list" of goals that came into the hands of the prosecutors was the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the defender of human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegal possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
It's the solution.
The carrier of Japan Airlines has recently used a function developed with a view to persons for whom travelling in a crying child company is a nightmare.
By means of the website, the lines allow for the inspection of the location of the aircraft.
If the connection concerned travels under the age of two years, the “child icon” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or guardians of the seat.
The same person who benefits from the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place far away from that occupied by the small person.
The BBC reports that the lines have already informed about the incompatibility of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third person or if a change of aircraft has occurred lately.
As expected, the idea was shared by the Internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by listening to noise reduction.
They're kids, we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of places for breathing mouth, swallowing or drinking," said user G Sundar.
Another of the netizens noticed that he had been harassed by crying children on the plane, but he changed his mind when he became his own parent.
There is also no need for Japan Airlines to issue a solution.
"Thank you for warning me from crying children during a 13-hour trip," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel office
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October at the event in Majorca as a result of Thomas Cook's bankruptcy on Monday.
As told on Friday by an autonomous representative of the Balearic Government of Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand contemporaries who would not be able to benefit from the October break in Majorce, they are also persons who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
He explained that 80% of the expected contemporaries who, due to the fall of the British company, had to resign from retirement in Majorce next month were German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons says, because Thomas Cook did not lead tourists on the Balearic Islands during November-April, losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He found that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the Majorka market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to Diario de Mallorca, in October, more than 1,000 people lost their jobs because of the major tourist crisis.
About 800 are fired officers from Thomas Cook's office in Palmie.
Other people are losing their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many major hotels, the owners of the property asked guests for an extra charge per night.
This situation has been experienced, among other things, by a number of tourists from Poland.
By Thursday, the Balearic Government considers that several decades of hotels in Majorce have stopped at least until the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's notice of bankruptcy and his co-operating companies.
In turn, the Friday newspaper "Diario de Ibiza" shows that most hotels in Ibiza, which cooperated with Thomas Cook, are not dealing with the intention of closing the premises in the next few weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British banker had cooperated with 42 hotels.
The Balearic authorities have announced, on average, that they will address the Government of Spain to support the region with an amount of EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook's travel office.
They found that the most damaged on this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is in Majorce.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July–September 2019, about EUR 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland still in 29th place, USA on the front
Women's representation of Poland takes place on Friday in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking.
At the same position, the coach team of Milos Staupinski was classified in the previous July composition.
It's a weak sword of leather.
How's October?
The leaders were the remaining Americans who had recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was kept by the Germans, and the third remained by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify as ME.
They were supposed to start a match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was presented each year, due to food poisoning.
In this situation, Poland will innovate the qualifications of the meeting with Spain on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier "Bialo-Red" will play two side games – October 3rd to leave Cyprus, and five days later in Kielcach with Brazil.
In the competition group Poland are representatives of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winner groups and the three best teams from other places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from other positions are playing in the barracks for the last three trips to the European Championships.
A total of 16 participants – England.
The male representation of Poland in the FIFA ranking in September fell from 20th to 22nd.
“Rz”: Smog has oppressed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air program are zero, and carbon furnaces will dig this winter as if nothing ever," we read on the first page of today's "Rzeczpospolit".
“To date, 82,000 applications for funding of a total value of 2 billion zł have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48,000 were positive.
The accepted proposals amount to over 915 million zł in total," he said, referring to data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the cost is returned from the programme.
The results of the program's reported silence are seen as "low".
Self-governments quoted by “Rz” are facing defeats of “Crystic Air” in, among other things, in too large bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic reporting, e-mailing, possible emission control.
This would improve the action," said Mayor of the Warminian People's Bar, Jacek Wisznowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alert note that in the first year of action, less than 1% of the established target of 3 million collapsing cats was achieved.
Although the programme budget is 103 billion zł for 10 years, i.e. 10 billion zł, this amount is virtual.
"In the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management this year, 1.4 billion zł was reserved," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Bláštak: Now price negotiations
The US Congress approved the sale of Poland's 32 latest F-35 aircraft.
"It is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but it is not the end of our work," Mariusz Błasczak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
Polish Air Force have nearly 32 F-35 Lightning II fans produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the Department of State of the United States expressed its approval for their sale in Poland.
The Communication emphasises that investment supports national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO allies, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
From information from the Department of State it is clear that Poland is to pay for $6.5 billion.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State indicated that the contract would also include the delivery of spare parts and repair equipment, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and programme support and staff training.
Thought Lockheed Martin F-35
F-35 Lightning II fan produced by Lockheed Martin is a unique and unique fifth-generation multitask thinker.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombings and typical fishing tasks for air combat.
Thanks to the use of steel technology, the thinker is undetectable for the radars of close range.
The F-35 thinker recently bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, will also consider the purchase of American warplanes.
The color against stereotypes.
Men's or boys' overcoats, knitted or crocheted
The producer of Barbie placed a series of neutral rings on the market with sex.
He wants to fight stereotypes this way.
Barbie's producer placed a series of neutral sex dolls on the market
Next to Barbie with different colors of skin, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced the sale of neutral sex dolls.
The plays from the Creative World series carry feathers.
Therefore, children can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both underside and dress.
In the respiration of the eyes of the dolls, the girl can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
It was also rejected by highlighting the characteristics of sex characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long beards and soft waists or – in the case of Kena – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children don't like their dolls when they have a set of sex rules, and some parents and feminists are convinced that games made with the idea of a specific sex inhibit girls' ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Barbie's daughter, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathroom and high-end shoes, was in the past repeatedly criticised for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as an unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already placed on the market dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also hijabe dolls.
Zandberg: around or club together can have several hundred letters
Zandberg asked for the ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates to the SLD, Spring and Levicy Together, starting with the common logo "Levica"), responded that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the result of Levia will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levia is not only right, but also has strength," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 ambassadors.
“This may mean that either the club or the club together will have several dozen letters.
But it depends on Poland and Poland.
I won't agree and tell you how this happens," he said.
Asked if Levica together would have a separate circle, Zandberg refused: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think this diversity has been rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that by making a difference, we have been able to do something about the joint programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Vladzimir Czarzasta, Zandberg replied that he considered the biggest beneficiaries to be central and left-wing voters.
In view of the fact that this SLD will receive the full subsidy, he refused that "the political party's goal is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that he was voting for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he indicated that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is still," he said.
"I say, however, very honest and clear that if I found myself in circle 44, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another circle," he stressed the policy.
"I don't think I'd try to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujekowski (KO - PAP)," he added.
In this district outside of Uchikowski, the leader of the population of RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are launched.
Dakar: The biggest match opens in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the opening of a huge match, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot to the Bopp district, where there was a new match that could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The object was built by the brotherhood of Mouride, which belongs to the Sufi nurturing of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
The work on the match began ten years ago in a subterranean area of six hectares passed by the government.
The name of the match Massalikul Jinan ("The Way to Paradise") comes from the title of the essay by Ahmad Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, named by the witnesses as saints.
The label is a career marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The ball in the middle of 15,000 faithful rooms, and the other one can stay on the outside planner.
In richly completed interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant gyrandols and the decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders say the match is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison of the match in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II match in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful men.
The building of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
In addition to the land, the government has founded lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road work worth EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Smile: Our problem is not a Słąsk, but us alone
The pass of eight league matches without winning the Corona ball will try to stop in the Friday meeting with the winner of the Słeska extraclass.
"Our problem is not to engage, but only ourselves, we must work on what we play," highlighted coach Mirosław Smila.
The last and so far the only victory in the people was recorded in the first row, when the 1:0 benign games of the Common Cancers were won on the trip.
Later, the count recorded two remissions and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Lubin in 1/32 final of the Polish Pucharu.
"I am touched by the optimism that in the last seconds, the footballers have been fighting for the gate, trying to get rid of it.
Their fall on the wall after the last star did not result from the collapse, but it was the fall of anger because they were so close," Smyla said.
As he pointed out, Słąsk has very strong wings, which is why he will feel the team playing in the side of the boxing sector.
"We have an awareness of the opponent's quality, but we're also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.
In the game of Friday in the Crown, it certainly does not play a pause for the excess of the yellow cards Firen Gnjatic, which will also miss the conjugated Jakob Žubrowski and Michael Gardowski.
The building is, however, to report to the match of a few racers with the wish of the game.
"We've had headaches, it just seemed to be gone, and now it's gone," Smila said.
Defendant Corony Daniel Düwniel stressed that Słąsk would not be an easy match for breaking the passport of the eight league matches in a row without winning, but in an eviction, everyone can win with everyone.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not show this in the fight, but the moment will come that we will win and believe it will be on Friday," the footballer pointed out.
After nine rows of Corona extracts with a five-point stock, it takes the 15th position.
The sledgehammer gathered about 12 more and was placed in a different place.
The fifth match in Kielcach will start at 20.30.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
"42% of species of trees on the European tree site are at risk," warns the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN) in the "Red Paper of European trees" published on Friday.
There are cassettes and jars on the front of the leaves.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It has been developed by experts who, based on the studies, have found that among the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons the Red Paper shares the rapid growth of urban and global climate change.
However, these trees and plants are most at risk, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of a typical European tree, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are threatened, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and plants, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper deals with errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive abstinence of trees, and further forest fires and changes occurring in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a strong risk of the existence of many European variations in soils, mosses and growth.
"The consequences of human activity lead to a gradual decline in the species of European plants and pose a danger to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," said the report Luc Bas, led by the European Bureau of IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not wish 600+
"Today, PiS wants to buy Polaków, offering them the freedom to make a loan, which will have to pay for the next generation," says Grzegorz Schetina in an interview for the "Rzeczpospolit".
In his view, "the entire PIS policy is a pizza".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be prohibited".
Shetina, in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz, has the idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this respect than the Kaczyn Party.
"Today, people who are aware who want to live in a normal country are more than PIS supporters, a party that has been opposed to the voting values, such as humility, humility, transparency," says Shetina.
The Leader of the People's Coalition and the President of the People's Platform also marked the fundamental foundations of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing will be taken, but we need to set the direction for the future, because the PS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, even if it is a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is about "curing Poland's energy, helping and investing in those who really work - and those who are business".
The Shetina explains that the KO program included a project that at least makes Poland more than 614 gold by hand, and more making – after several hundred.
The politician also said he didn't want to race for divorce.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he does not promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the leaders have objected to the opposition to arbitration, until the end of the country's financial downturn," he stressed.
The scene in the interview for the "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidwa-Blonski.
"We'd like to use their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The dog is moving ahead of the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state like Banas is crystalline," he added.
Leader PO also said he has not yet decided whether to apply for the Leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Big Corners
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, there were six large dead condors – informs TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Condors are likely to be poisoned by means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten toxic waste.
Besides one young man, the rest of the dead condoms were grown up.
“This is a great loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of propagation.
So we're losing a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organisation.
"I think that the use of toxic substances and poisons affects not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a dress for the president
They've been working on recognizing the head of the drug chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy’s office – we read in the “Rzeczpospolitj”.
According to the newspaper, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal badge officially called in the period of the intermilitary siege of the Rzečippospolitan.
For the last time, he was probably used by President Ignac Mištsky.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrey Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate Human Rights Commission has voted in favour of a proposal for a new law on orders and designations in order to restore it.
The newspaper says it's also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the state's head.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has failed by one vote.
This time, work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they were in possession of the opinion of the President's Office.
She was in the middle of September.
"I inform you that the Office of the President of the PP does not give any attention to the position presented in this petition," President Andrzej Dera wrote.
In the middle of the case, the Senate commission continued and again devoted little time.
"The President's Office replied briefly: it's for that to be restored," said Commissioner Robert Mamutov of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He made a request for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be conducted, among other things, on the cross-section of Al-Teeplinski from Al-Pilsudski.
Continual actions have little to do with recent complaints by the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to maintain proper cross-sectional behaviour.
On Friday, September 27th, the police launch the preventive "Transmission crossings" in Russia.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: crossing without getting out, not using light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and so we really make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, the vice-president of the city a few days ago.
His words were echoed at a press conference, where the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars after crossings, which results in the shocks.
At the same time, the president called on travellers to reason on the road, including a faster movement in the light or a lack of text messages while driving.
The issue was somewhat taken up by the Soviet police, who have been launching the "Transport Crossing" campaign since today.
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the occurrence of a restriction on cross-sectional traffic by drivers who are not on the move without the possibility of continuing the drive.
This is a common exaggeration that contributes to exacerbating traffic difficulties and creating shocks.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 zł and 2 criminal points.
In addition, the mangroves will pay attention to the non-use of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of the drive, the late movement under the signalers, the free passage of crossings and the remaining too long distances between vehicles.
What intersections will take place?
M.in. on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellovski Street; al. Cieplinski from al. Pilsudski; Targow Street from al. Pilsudski; Plac śreniawiti from ul. Dębrowski or ul. Hetmanski from al. Pustanič Warsaw.
This kind of action in the capital of Podkarpacia will take place on the next Friday of October.
They checked the company for waste from "Czajki"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Volominian and Air Force Inspection of the Construction Supervisory have checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where wastes from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw are used," said the author of the Volominian authority, Karol Szyszko.
The inspectors of the age of Volomina carried out controls at a plant located in the forests of the village of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Business-Trans" private plant, under the agreement with the "Czajka" municipal waste treatment services.
"The installation was destroyed, and an entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be transmitted to, among other things, the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Vojevodzka Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was found, however, that the company did not collect samples, measurements and groundwater tests, nor did it have the results of the studies of stabilised municipal waste plants from the "Chajka" sewage treatment plant.
After the VIOŠ, Darius Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
The private store "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilised municipal waste deposits from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to waste disposal in the area of production, in the forests around the Greens, waste is processed by a mass of up to 60,000 tonnes per year.
Warsaw City Corporation of Waterways and Canalization reported last Thursday that on November and December 2018 the operation was excluded from STUOS, which was related to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
According to the MPWiK, their monthly export cost is 1.7 million zł (estimated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
The Lech Wałusa supported Malgorzata Kidya-Blonski.
"You have taken on a difficult task, perhaps you can count on my total support," Lech Wałęs said to Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonski on Friday.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word for me," replied the candidate of the People's Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, it is now "only on retirement".
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska met with former President Lech Wałęsa at his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
In a short conversation behind closed doors, Valęsa’s son, Jarosław, also took part.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after the Lech Wałuss meeting.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to us all.
That is why it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and we, all of us – those who love Poland – will be able to support your actions as much as possible," said the former president, returning to Kidawi-Blonski.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about constitution and what it is about," she said.
"Let us show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, according to law, according to respect for others.
This is how you have done your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blonska stressed.
Kibic on retirement
Wałusa, in his interview with the journalists, said he is now "only on retirement".
"Of course I'm looking at it.
I hope we reverse the events, that what was good, proven, will be returned.
The three powers are the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we need to get back to normal action, and that's what I believe we're doing this time.
Because if not, we're waiting for a street criterion," Lech Wałuss said.
“It is therefore so important that the Polish people go to the elections, decide and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-Blonska gave.
"The last chance we'll improve the status of things in Poland," the president replied.
"We need to build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made to Poland, Kidawa-Blonska said: "The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no trifle of power, if the constitution is not respected, we need to go back to the beginning and lead it to become clear and that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move forward."

The Senate decided on the key legislation
The Senate adopted without amendment the Act on the disclosure of the property of the most important civil servants and the flights of the most important persons in the country.
In order to November the Act on the property of the families of state officials – without amendment – voted 52 senators, 14 opposed, three abstained from the vote.
The same senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the mid-term debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to the amendment, they had the law to "civilize" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration of the situation of own children, of married children, of children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person responsible for making a statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Chief State Officers, which was established in the Prime Minister's office, was adopted by Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions require that, inter alia, the Prime Ministers, Ministers, Ambassadors, Members of the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those at the head of other State institutions, will be obliged to place property information on the property of spouses, children and persons remaining in common interest.
The Senate also did not propose an amendment to the Aviation Act of the most important persons in the country.
it regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the conduct of the Central Lottian Register.
Under the law – without amendment – 55 senators spoke, 12 opposed, four abstained from the vote.
In accordance with the law, each flight of the President will be a flight "in the official mission".
Members of the family and others invited by the President will be able to join in the President's flights.
However, the flight of the official Prime Minister and the marshals of the Sejm and Senate will only be carried out “in order to carry out tasks directly related to the performance of the function”.
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegations may be invited by the regulations on the aircraft, including the letters, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; and journalists.
According to the law, in the event of doubts about the flights of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will explain them.
If such doubts are not explained in due time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm office or the Senate of the absence of the possibility of such a flight.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last race
Polish lawmakers took their first training in Paris on Friday, where on Saturday they will compete for a brown medal.
According to Vitala, the road to the title was closed on Thursday with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles on the trip to this one.
This time, without such problems, they met with the Slovaks in the morning with the charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the relationship between the people in the professions, the world's champions were undernourished.
As Assistant Michel Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the same exercise of the siatcaric elements.
“We went to the hall, but most of the time was the time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the racers and the training staff.
"We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two words, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd come back to this game.
We were discussing this game with each other in the station, the coach was talking a lot to the racers.
As two main causes of defeat, I would have shown inability in the attack and much worse than usual meeting with the situational balls.
The Slovaks were much better than us in this regard," he analyzed.
In his view, the "White-Red" did not interfere with the stress associated with the performance against supported by the loud and large audience of the tournament economy.
He admitted that the world's champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semifinal.
"Perhaps if we had a similar failure at the group stage, we would be faster to analyze this lesson and later to play at the further stage of the tournament.
But it's just a joke," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Poland's Thursday defeat will be overcome by aggression in the brown match.
"I hope we will show our true faces then.
There's nothing to fight about.
The last ME medal we fought in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poland during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group, they met in Apeldoorn, and they moved to Ljubljana in the semifinal.
Nick Kyrgyz: cruel punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start ban and a fine of $25,000 - in half a year - for the nagging words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour agents are losing patience in Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the results of the most uncensored professional tennis player over the last few years seems awful – 16 weeks plus a lot of crime, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the step-by-step athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgyz is only 24 years old, but he has been working out for a long time and has made his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on the card and next to it.
Voice curses, strange gestures, non-sport behavior, injury to the judge and sights, breaking two rockets during a lost match with Karen Chačanov – all after the August ATP Masters 1000 tour in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play long, but was able to publicly say that ATP operators were "simply damaged", which caused the organisation's authorities so much pain that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against the Kyrgyz and, after a few weeks, gave the said start-up and further punishment.
However, the word about corruption was forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, it was argued that the investigation showed that Kyrgyz’s behaviour over the last 12 months in many cases had caused serious reservations and almost continued violations of the rules that he had repeatedly injured the Vulgarians in a way that involved tournaments and sights, hence a high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days of appeal and immediately dismissed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply within the next six months with several conditions: in the ATP Tour and the ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgyos tournaments, he can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of Professional Tennisists, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, fight judges and the public, and no other way of acting unfavourable and vulgar.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during the tournaments, as well as outside the season, to consult with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes who do not have proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgyz’s first comment (in social media) was like this: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, as in Puchare Lavera, he had to stop at the nearest launch in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
The ATP Kyrgyos ranking takes 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the thunderstorms he will have a lot to do.
GUS: In Poland, life is getting better
The GUS's report on household budgets published on Friday shows that, as a good or rather good case, it assessed its material situation in ub.r. to 44% of them.
This percentage year was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective estimates of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
Its material situation was considered to be bad or rather bad in the UK, totaling 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% of the year before and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households working on their own accounts is best.
In this group it is considered to be good or rather good by 70% of respondents.
In the second run, there are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to parents of single-parent offspring, including a good or rather good material situation declared 32%.
Among children, this weight (depending on the number of children) ranges from 55 to 60% and among the homeless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before being launched (in 2016), the worst of their material situation was assessed by their single parenting offspring and by multi-family families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poland is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households at the level of voivodships.
The best estimates form the population of the Polish voivodship, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good 48.9% of the population.
There are also lupusian voivodships (47.7%), słąskies (47.6%), mazowiskis (47.3%) and Western Pomerania (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, the regulatory income (i.e. after the payment of taxes and contributions) was 94% of the national average and 98% of Lubuska.
The highest incomes were from the residents of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Słąski (104%).
On average in Poland, the regulatory income per person amounted to 1693 zł in 2018.
As a result of the change in prices, the real share of prices increased by 4.3% in 2017.
Over the past few years, it turned out to be pretty low.
In 2016, income per person rose by 7% and by 6.3% later.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These were converted into a person in the year 1187 zł, which means that they actually fell by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% and by 4.3% in 2016.
Studies in household budgets suggest that the domestic statistical economy currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory revenue, while this share still exceeded 80% in 2014, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

The woman wore a white cell under a black shirt that was very much rubbing through it.
USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – reported the U.S. Navy warship.
In the last two years, in total, five members of the crew of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three Marines were shot last week.
Each event occurred on the ground when the USS George H. W. Bush settled by the coast of Virginia.
As of now, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death is not to be associated with one another.
“It is necessary for everyone to engage in the presentation of suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other impact on the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, commander of the ship on Facebook.
Unsanitaryly critical of the pope.
John Paul II didn't do anything.
In his discussion with Peter Lekszyk Stefan Niesiolovski, John Paul II stressed that in 1981 he was a huge authority for opposition actors.
‘In fact, every opinion was accepted.’
Later, the criticism of some of his actions appeared.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk, and he was greatly appreciated for his pontificacy.
The Redemptorist – the harmor of the Church and of Poland – developed his media in the best way of life of the pope of Poland," he explained.
PO’s politicians admitted: “There were discontents, the pope said something that Ridzika had never accepted, but he had authority and politics could simply throw him out of the church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, like his followers," explained Niesilowski.
“In addition, this fatal case of paedophilia and the Church’s activities has come, and indeed their lack.
I ran a little forward thinking, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know of these horrible things," says Niesiolovski, a journalist.
In the evaluation of the former PO policy, the Church is an ally of the PiS.
“It should be acknowledged that during the time of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celibacy began with the holy Mass, and the cross was hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzik shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black section of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come to pay him," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that Pope Francis will drive Jadraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of that kind," he said.

Unvalidated grab
The old Polish Puchara between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechi Gdańsk with a small hair did not end tragically when fired by the Wejherow rocket drummers of a millimetres past the opposite team's armored team, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After that, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
This case was investigated by the PZPN Commission, which was subject to severe punishment by Griffon, excluding him from future play.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Pucharze in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the cubes will not be released in the nearest match at their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to the league games until 31 December.
Burds at the Łódź Video Stadium also called the Słąska Wrocław kibika.
However, the decision of the PSC was easier because Słąsk had preceded that similar events could occur and felt the relevant authorities in this regard.
In addition, the services have allowed the maritime sector to be decommissioned with raisins, the heating of chairs and the strengthening of the economic sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the police intervention had to use the watercraft.
PZPN punished Słąsk with a one-time stadium ban in the closest match in Pucharze Polski and banned the organisation of the games in this and the next edition of PP.
The ban was also imposed on the league matches of the Extraclasses, but it will last until 31 December.
Foreign names of cities on road signs also in Poland
DGDKiA plans to exchange labelling on the entire managed network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDPKiA Networking
In Podkarpaci, the introduction of a regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure for e.g. the recording of foreign names of cities on the road signs also began after Poland.
For example, "Lows" will appear next to "L'viv".
Our voivodship will introduce changes to 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's supposed to be easier, easier and simpler.
The new guidelines are based on the update of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries are often also Polish words.
Thanks to the changes we have made, they will finally appear on the roadside at our roads.
The introduction of a new marking begins with the sub-carpack section of the A4 motorway," Andrzej Adamczyk, the infrastructure minister, informed.
The amendments will be introduced on 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total investment cost?
200 grand.
In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned until 1 November 2019.
How's the idea going to look?
He'll be surrounded without changing the plates, basically by a sticker.
They will replace the existing local names with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be recorded in one verse – first in the Polish order and then in the original, in the nuisance.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the country where they are located.
Feel the game with Razor Nari Ultimate for Xbox One
Razer announced Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One – the world's first headset to Xbox One powered by haptic technology.
HyperSense ensures saturation in games and ensures better control of the environment.
Razer HyperSense uses the successful solutions developed by Lofelt, a German company that specializes in the creation of advanced successful technologies that provide realistic touch-based impressions.
HyperSense uses special random drivers and smart digital processing signals to generate a touch-on feedback of high resolution in real time, giving the possibility of full poisoning in each game on Xbox One.
Technology recognises sound signals and transforms them into dynamic vibrations, so players can feel in play without the need to install additional software.
Using touch intelligence, sound signals can closely monitor action in the game.
Razer HyperSense plays events – from silent steps after powerful explosions, giving precisely all the activity around the player.
“Nari Ultimate for Xbox One was designed to provide all players with an additional size of play.
Thanks to HyperSense, we allow them to be completely absorbed in their favorite titles," said Alvin Cheung Senior Vice President of Peripheral Razer.
The commercial trailers are equipped with a pan filled with a form memory and a layer of cooling iron to reduce the heat generated during long use.
To make it easier to support hearing aids, a quick push button was placed on the removed microphone and a hyperSense intensity regulator on the furniture and a balance between the game and the chat.
Self-adjusting the shape of the head strap ensures trouble-free and accurate adjustment.
In addition, Razor Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has an Xbox Wireless feature that allows direct connection to the console without the need to use the wireless transmission-receptor device, allowing easy and fast configuration.
Listeners also support the Windows Sonic system, which provides a more realistic sound.
Razer Nari Ultimate, originally intended for PC computers, debuted on the market in September 2018.
Thanks to Nari Ultimate for Xbox One, Razer can now offer this award-winning technology to Xbox One fans.
The set was estimated at EUR 219.99.
Someone shot the windshields.
In the state of Zamec, the inhabitants of Lower Silesia noticed the weaknesses of the wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it appeared that someone had set a target for the animal – in his body there was a hole in the wind.
"The information about the bird was received from the inhabitants of the Wild Animals Rehabilitation Centre in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We made it.
It was right now that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him and not to affect additional stress.
The boat was caught and confined to the vet.
After the first picture of RTG it was known that someone had made a shot of it.
There were cracks in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a rehabilitation center.
Transmitter in center
"The mornings have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where they spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
The release would now be linked to the likely lack of winter survival," Walasek adds.
The staff will be released for the same period in the spring after being rehabilitated.
The authorities of the municipality of Zukowice, after receiving information about the cause of animal health, intend to inform the prosecution.
This event has occurred in the past
Gowin: "We need to encourage Polish, retail trade"
"The effective taxation of supermarkets does not solve the retail problem, it will be necessary to consider whether the country has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
Gowin, during his interview with the "Day Signs" in Radio Unit, found that the trade is under the control of international networks that place so low a margin on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
In view of the fact that the problem is very difficult to deal with, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government was trying to measure it at the very beginning of the term of office, but was given "the opposite of the KE".
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Law wins the closest elections and forms the government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the real taxation of supermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, so small trade".
"It will now be necessary to decide whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake in recognising that Polish retail tax was not permitted by public aid.
The retail tax law imposed two tax rates from trade: 0.8% from income between 17 million zł and 170 million zł per month and 1.4% from income above 170 million zł per month.
The tax was due as of September 2016.
In September 2016, the KE initiated a infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued then that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It subsequently found that the tax had been introduced in a way that was not in conformity with the law.
It also issued a suspension order for the use of the tax until its analysis was completed by the officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The main decision of the EU court opened the way to reintroduction of taxes, but did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU Press Service informed the PAP that the case is now at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
At the moment, it is unknown whether or not the oral procedure is in motion, namely the hearing of the parties and the possible debate.
It takes a good couple of months to make an appeal to announce the judgment.
"This procedure lasts for an average year," the PAP said a source in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you get the baby to be baptized?
Several practical solutions are being discussed.
Baptism is an extremely important Christmas in the life of the infant and his parents.
Often it is the first time that the entire family is focused around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world together.
It's no wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best that day.
Before you make a final decision about your child’s machine, however, think about whether or not it will be convenient.
In stores you can find many machine kits that do not provide small comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for the selection of clothing for baptism is the age of the child
In recent years, several-year-olds have been baptized, arranged in white sets, and placed in the same folds or large floors.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: a few months, a year, and even older.
It's not hard to imagine that such a great comfort already needs something else to be dressed for baptism.
Therefore, if your child on the day of baptism has 3-4 months, it is likely that the birthday will be spent in the car or in the hands of parents or Christians.
The best way out is to show it in comfortable, cottony sleeps or complete.
Although this wardrobe element is considered to be an old day, it is enough to search for its sacred options, for example with a falbank or a crown.
For the boy, ideal points will be displayed with the print of the muscle and the brain.
In the case of older children, you may be allowed to have a greater imagination in the closet.
The girl's gonna look pretty in a simple, tiular dress
Many parents of girls with disabilities look at the rich, falbanian dress for christmas in a complex with coats, tails and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-respiratory materials in which children are simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the appropriate clothing will better look at the Asanti for Kids shop, which offers elegant machines on cotton underwear.
The delicate, tiular skirts, satin skirts, crowns, applications and charming kits will make your daughter look delicious and feel comfortable.
Ideal for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Up until recently, the boys' parents had a fashion on a suit that was a copy of the "golden" models.
Polyester sailors and lower, stiff collusions or caskets often caused young elegators to show their discontent with loudness.
Luckily, today, they were cut off by comfortable, cotton kits.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, hairy undercoats, and the blouse is decorated from the front to the camel's pattern.
These machines seem to be extremely remarkable, but at the same time they do not interfere with the movements of the little world.
Kristina Pavlović published a statement
Kristina Pavlović made a statement at the end of her term of office.
It turns out that the PiS sent 110,000 bad savings.
Let us remember that Paullovic ordered his departure from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of 110 thousand zł
As a result of the statement made by the letter, it takes a monthly pension of 4.7 thousand zł.
Pavlović has an apartment worth 570 thousand zł and a little less that he rents, taking 880 zł a month.
The mission also invests in industrial metals, appreciating an investment of 150 thousand zł.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczynski also published a statement of assets.
Voting on the interruption in proceedings during the Conservative Party Conference
The British parliamentarians voted against the triennial interruption in the proceedings of the Gmin Chamber for the annual Conservative Party programme conference, which the government has referred to.
289 letters were made, contrary to 306.
Usually, the Gmin Chamber does not discuss during the party conferences, so that the Members do not have to refuse either to participate in them or to attend Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the date of Britain's departure from the European Union scheduled for 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the government, 289 letters were made against 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The absence of consent to the suspension may be taken as a political revenge of opposition to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was deemed by the Supreme Court to be inconsistencies with the law and the non-conformity) and for the fact that the judge does not wish to apologize for it after the judgment.
Following this decision, the Gmin Chamber resumed the session, and the most important event was the presentation of Johnson and the following heated debate after him.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the Brexit and avoiding the early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brexit.
It is necessary to implement it in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit has to come to us so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health service, the cost of life.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," said Johnson.
The Conservative Party Conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester on the next Sunday and to be held on Wednesday, 2 October.
The two main opposition groups, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already been held.
One of the reasons that Johnson gave by explaining the long suspension of Parliament was a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-chemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," says foreign media.
The President's spokesman strongly deplored these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, such as "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", writes that Andrzej Duda, at a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Consulate of the PP in New York, said that it is Israel who blames for the recent anti-chemical attacks in Poland.
The president said the increase in anti-Seemic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the Israeli leaders' rhetoric.
He referred to the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel Katza, who said in February that "Polish sent an anti-Semitism with mother's milk."
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel has not apologized for insulting statements made by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Ambassador Polski of Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polac, Polak".
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland".
According to the Spaghal portal, "it's invented."
According to the "JI" speakers at the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, marked by the Cross of the Commandary Order of Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and say that the Jews of Israel "as Israel Kac" are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Boteach portal, Mosberg's speech was to be interrupted.
Who's Banash and what's wrong?
The stone leased by the founders led the journalist to discover neglect in Mariana Banasia's property statements.
We're summarizing another affair that has shaken the governing camp.
TVN's supervisors have revealed that Marian Banasz, president of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not, in recent years, entered into a statement of a 400-metre property stone that is located on the Krakow Podhorz.
More than that, his tenant had in that rock of sexuality (and thus renting rooms for hours).
As a result, the building itself has been reported to have secured the payment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the Supervision program.
The journalist revealed that the stone was rented by people associated with the criminal world from Banasia to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banas replied inadvertently and inadvertently to the charges.
What's interesting, rented by the stonekeepers, led the journalist to discover neglect in Banasia's property statements.
The stone itself was described in them as inexplicable, and the income from the rent was to be reduced.
"The mother of Mariana Banasia and his wife may be between 6 million and 8 million zł.
In total, couples can praise two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal's analysis, Banasia's own stone was worth about 3 million dollars.
The Anti-Corruption Office currently controls the assets statements of Mariana Banasia from 2015 to 2019.
Banas said he would stop his activities at the NIK by the time it was finished. "I'm going to join you for a free break," he said.
Opposition requires clarification.
"We do not hear that CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of the assets statements of Mariana Banasia.
Therefore, we are forced to order the state authorities and to report on the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Vice-President Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Poland had so high a low price for the rental of its property, it would have had 10 checks, a tax household and a carnival procedure," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
This position was called on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy was declared by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party.
Banas was previously associated with NIK in 1992-2005, acting in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczynski.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the police command will be karane
According to the newspaper, the enforcement of a particular order issued by the police is to be a new kind of offence, a threat of crime, a arrest or a restriction of liberty.
This is what police allies want to do.
The idea came to the Commission's seed for the Question of Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million cases have been brought before the Polish courts," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" stated that the petition, which the Independent Police Trade Union writes to the letters on the amendment of the code of departure has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Excise.
He would say: “Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be subjected to imprisonment, imprisonment or limitation of liberty”.
‘Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who are unable to carry out orders, impossible or difficult to carry out the service’, the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "The Rzeczpospolit" that although it agrees with the main text of the proposal for a regulation, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political demonstrations.
"In the situation of free demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and instead of making the situation more difficult, rather than exacerbating it," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of the population have positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and have received 1.5 million urban interventions each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
I'm Topol writing in blood.
Among his predecessors are editors, interpreters, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important battled Czech dramaturgies, today mentioned in one line with Václav Havl.
Thus, from the beginning, the curse of the talent that he was trying to use was hung on the top of his head.
After eight years, he came back with a sensitive man.
Bohaterami are Buras and Soná with two sons, but they do not create a typical Czech family.
They're watertight actors, they're traveling around Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound, and for the second time, he stopped in childhood.
But these are not heroes in this story most important.
Everyone is the only ground for observing a world where there is no room for artists.
It's a world of densely populated provinces, old societies, suspicious people, and so on of young people.
"A sensitive man" places itself as an absurd theatre.
Narration follows didascalia, and the conversation of the heroes creates this world.
The scene is Europe full of fears about its future, but also endless questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian daughter Neckermann works.
The company, however, has problems.
As VRT TV reports, the Brussels Airlines lines have announced that they cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All exits with an office that has been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but in time they will be able to receive a refund.
In Gandawi, the court also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently about 12,000 Belgians are staying abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
The next 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
Another speaker, Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers, said on Monday that the company is currently "in full operation" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company, a mother who caused anxiety among employees and clients.
The Bureau then agreed that the customers who bought the trip in it would go on a vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel offices in the world – announced a fall at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was to break up on Sunday's last chance with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the rescue plan already agreed in August, the company received an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period when the travel agency usually has lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been rising for several years, with the effect of a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
The actions will help to combat the ongoing decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the most moved east of the city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel is attracting 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also competes with a permanent settlement of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which turned into a 25% drop in the city's population.
In 2013, it was made up of 54 thousand people.
To fight the population, officials came up with the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the programme is concerned, 150 applications have been made.
Two thirds of them made big cities.
The program also took an interest in people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was about to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here for four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free homes, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will be carried out on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants.
The information collected from the interviews and questionnaires will help to revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said the program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to allow new residents, offering them accommodation incentives.
The first was Detroit, who introduced a payment program for promising young specialists to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
