A Republican Strategy to Prevent Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre recently considers this a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a beam.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments have enacted new laws that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has been extended since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the pre-emptive voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote to citizens with criminal backgrounds.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity document with photographs.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities therefore rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bill projects in 34 states to force voters to present an identity document with photography.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a document of universal identity, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people aged to vote, do not have any identity document with photographs issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions therefore disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with photographs.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote the most for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photographs issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorise members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished electoral registration on the same day of election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an aid service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of the Hispanics, exactly the same would happen.
These represent only 11 per cent of the voters, which is equal to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the register of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Prosecutor's Ministry intervenes to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law requiring the submission of an identity document with photographs.
However, it is unmistakable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party's nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to confirm whether these legislative amendments at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to make useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough to make men doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
Is the test done or not?
We've asked for advice from the specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, a large index of contagion between sample groups was detected, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, followed by 12 years of age, also showed that between 30 and 40 per cent of the potential for metastasis had not been tested.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are harmless.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the risk level of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered to him or her and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not respond to long-term life, in which case he or she should be better chosen for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress, we offer them treatment.
We are increasingly setting the necessary criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no smoker, that rate would rise at least 50%," andré Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobacco continues to be a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is a huge loss of people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
One hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favour the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Carcase products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its humid, dried, or salted may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each individual with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs's bag in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the responsible mechanism of the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicts the standard model: our better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it's not quite clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, let's assume it's Higgs, because the chances of making a mistake seem to be little, we'll see what it's all about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unforgivable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that norm and don't try too hard, because it will end up doing harm.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of exclusion of Paul, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantical state"; a "state" that consists in a large way of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we meet with the good citizens called Fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand, there are beans, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Piece Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the beans are divided into two groups: the moons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be in some way parental way.
These beans, they could be underlined here, they're not the exotic kisses we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as "messier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone to a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (from light, from infrareds, ultraviolets, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "strength bearers".
Stablest Field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it's about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. In order to activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energy, a bit like it was a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great hadron collisioner is a 27 km circumference ring!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way) don't have it.
Now, what can all these investigations do?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to look at the differences between MS' observations and predictions.
For their part, many earnestly want to meet, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "physical new" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, we must say, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation of gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the universe matter (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The implications of such investigations in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no one.
To see: early in the 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would cause.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell's laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, the laser was at first considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagination...
In addition, applications can also come from all the tools around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light capturer in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but that they never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Committee on Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Dedor's been trying to look for him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying her had given her a breath of two years.
"They had given me five years of life, but I have already taken seven," he reported, a walk, fell into his bed in the Beloeil palliative care center, Victor-Gadbois, the day he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
The disease has caused damage to her: a huge weakness that prevents her from going alone to the bathroom and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetiteful lunch, he accepts the offer of helping him eat.
Valient, even comes to smile, to talk to the strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that disease.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes a foothold," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Ms. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and exhausted".
But the disease has caused her children to discover.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I no longer have any desire in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers to care for the body and help with food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help your death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you are offered with brandy or Pepsi mouthwashes, according to your request.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we used a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the centre of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savores his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his lunches while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying to survive it all.
"For six months, there's always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarvent center come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
One 77 per cent of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a sick person reaches the terminal phase of his life, either in his home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Palliative Care Society at the Grand Montréal Home, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminence of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been on the move to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not sufficiently competent as to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted with euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die only because they don't get the proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are obsessed with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already low when he left treatment with exhausting chemotherapy.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me I was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me there was nothing more to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank their caregivers for not responding to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep with the patient until the moment of death, either in sporadic or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the disease that is not relieved will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report has been possible through a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund collectors of political parties and experts of the Italian mafia have, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
A "industry" that came out too expensive for the Quebec contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system is sprayed once we've hit the big media," irony Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the abuses related to road contracts in Quebec, which the prime liberal minister, Jean Charest, at that time, had only allowed to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", he adds, while waiting to be able to "demonstrate the existing strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau Squad", which, since 2009, has made Montreal's "cartel of the cantarillad" move on to the time of inflaming contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registering a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated subsidies have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally charged with engineers of the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused the Commission to be moved to explain the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
For three years, he paid a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to the Montréal Union, mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of acceding contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an executive of public works, perfectly explained it to the committee: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and corporate bribes in the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all of this in exchange for contracts of alcantarillad.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30% and 40% in terms of false extras.
In addition, a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a bold look at a parallel budget and filled out his dirty money sheets.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay left early in November and led Montreal to an enormous crisis.
Chantal Roueau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she takes "out of a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And it adds that the process is "pangered, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful so that questionable practices do not repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians in the current of the strategy."
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically, "they told me that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "until election costs are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a comprehensive review of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot fall below; we can go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would that advance explain?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Advance day by day on your side.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I didn't save myself.
From my beginnings in the pre-training centre of Clairefontaine's INF to my step by Saint-Etienne, I've always progressed to an aggravating step.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to arguing very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all up.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
It is supported by supporters like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eight-style finals.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league in front of the Porto in order to be able to receive the turn of eights in the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for a long time.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is delivered to its resources to ensure that the project is implemented.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in taking this title of champions.
We haven't reached far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we had the best conditions to finish the first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if the big teams like Marcella, Lyon and Burdeos are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 home in Troyes, they still meet with things that reproach us a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to be classified for eight finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the reverse amounts, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be to ignore our opponents and the champion of France.
Lyon and Marcella, who were not well the previous season, have seen themselves "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, in spite of all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a Zlatendency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
It has come to prove that it is the star of League 1.
And it has shown on all the teams that have passed that it is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the team in France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to take part in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accruing time of play.
I saw things there and I went out reinforced.
Today I achieve playing good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we must have exemplary behavior today.
What view do you have of Didier Deshamps' first month in front of the blues?
You're getting results.
They are well placed in the world ranking group.
The selector is strict, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps leads to Brazil's selection.
Did the Empate (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve to sit the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't had a game like it in my whole career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling without banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equally.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as forms of payment.
The rate of bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before the 10 dollars were returned today (quotations are recorded on bitcoincharts.com).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even on changing occasions).
The social Facebook network also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositaries of accounting books, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key hit consists of writing that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched by computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
This is a phase of file-sharing, i.e., the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical trail.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "crossing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular trail (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphan, as both have different marks.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the computational power.
The life of the network already has its highlands.
The sites offering Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weightors such as Wikipedia refuse payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of account and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November the giants were launched.
"The $30,000 has been changed," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equal to a credit card (in real currency) or to a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which is cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put into practice in trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide you with a address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", requires Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are present.
There is a general movement of revisions of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but there could be a change in 2013," she predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks that are now high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the Tayikos.
Tolerable, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from above the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was ordered.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, watched by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistable advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its control over the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old multi-acids, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, becoming government land to resell them as solar to refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are faithless; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity will also go: capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
Those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to work.
All, including the armed opposition, are greedy of mobile phones. Turkish television and its leaflets that present a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who wish to direct the country be considered to be legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the prime minister that has existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the basis of the elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, their country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no embalming has been arranged, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth was spread.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take possession of them.
No energy to extract the minerals of iron or copper from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavat the huge Buddhist location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
There will also be a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new Treaty of Cooperation provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' colleges, children's colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "gain the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), deleted in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain locations.
These works, greedy to obtain local work, have been able to help contain insurrection: rice, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we remember after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to bring it directly to them.
A Constitution with strengths in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he has decided to play everything for everything.
He took the whole world by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And almost two years ago Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakened institutional stability and led to judicial confusion.
This new initiative has only increased fractures in the country.
For its opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "traiting his word" and "tracing the right".
Through its partners, it is ensured that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the debate causes corruption throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "whether they vote on my text or I hold the full powers," powers which are supposed to reach their end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, an Islamic majority, voted yesterday.
Most liberals did not go to the summons.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed that they could not make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to all of them yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As we could expect, the voting items have been unanimous.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, for the fact that one of the few differences in the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee have come to think that the Constitution clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which provided that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals shut him down of hypocrisy and consider it no more than a publicity craft.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular to anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the assumptions of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not lecturers, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic case law, etc.].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms relating to the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers will claim to be few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations requested, will not be prohibited.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be libertarian.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The Heads of State party took place on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect the holy land, the world's clouds and a salt sea
The promised earth combines the magnificence of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on water, the calming of storms and full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers use the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus here (in Latin "Delorosa View").
Start in the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continue through the streets of the Old City, go to the Holy Sepulchre in the Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombligum of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people from different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to the climb can.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a great flood of tourists.
Even there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On one trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It retains the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the wilderness of Judea, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings there are bands of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesare it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and categorically donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're in it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea they are even bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around you are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with salt water, salmura and healing bars and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to arrange their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of ancient times
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the capital of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and the Persian rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mism" symbol, fortune will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can pass through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to wish for: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shekels (currently $1-3.8 shekels).
The urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast traffic and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's from a underground funnel.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by crossing for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only served kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are wet bean balls, fruits and vegetables.
No street dogs are seen on the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well fed cats who "walk at their own pleasure" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The trousers love the places they compete and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will leave you for 15 weeks a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to the country and to rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% at the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will lead you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While Members and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory review, they have already appeared in the country of shy people who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help your families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force which requires each migrant worker to carry out an examination to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to review the language, unless it is also the Russian history and the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
It is the exception of the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
The persons who obtained their education and diplomas certificates before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examining centres will be served by the Russian Institute of Pushkin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present evidence in all cities, and now more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law entered into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First of all, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many people today talk about the defence of the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebellev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are those of unprofessional immigrants, education, who don't know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebellev, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paying trip" to a exploding and narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," says the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but your own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give children to eat, because they don't talk about clothes, shoes, and buy what they need for school.
When you get to adolescence, these guys start working on the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have such status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only a thousand fifty rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," said reporters the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be quiet, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was shown that not only immigrant registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as much as the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the " diplomas" cannot be purchased, converted by government officials and rights defenders.
Up to now, the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not be able to successfully pass the exam the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illicit arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law with greater rigour in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the Government's reaction to recent incidents: To catch shots during weddings in which there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinográdov, in which to catch seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of trauma weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed" policy.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures be taken of "unreasonable rigourism".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, according to the BBC news service in Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms were committed during the six months of 2012 in respect of a total of 1168 recorded crimes for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a more stringent legislation in the field of civil-use weapons will not be an discomfort for the offender to address the black market.
Now, according to your words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms requests
The first, "arms of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons of police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come out for sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premedicated to cover the lack," one exile commented.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also place their sand granite.
"Now they have distributed private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the line to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes crafts, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explains.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit arms supply on the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons of the black market have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where armed conflicts exist, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The dependant of one of the arms stores, who asked for his name not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators did not buy them for a long time because they were too old.
More often, it says, suppliers address military stores when they need a match.
Through some apheresis, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we say.
"But, of course, the police are on the verge of all cases, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be implemented, they make proof purchases to illegal arms dealers," the addict adds.
"Like in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would lead me to a "honest" where we could negotiate.
At the price of the gun, I'll only get there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"In order to get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the shopkeeper. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to come, we say "on the part of Mr Ivanovich, who asked him to tell you that a tooth had fallen on his daughter".
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to tell him.
The novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was available.
Schematics, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "everything."
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a cat for free: everything that is available can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"They give me an opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal encounters are required for this purpose.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the headline "Buy a gun or a machine."
There the users make their requests and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," he laconically raises his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
And the people went, like a hungry fish to the blind, and then to pull out coals in Siberia.
military commentator and exile Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hiding," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online request is made, one remains unarmed and puts him in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the blind, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Macarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-class leaders.
According to official ministerial statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which represents 22.900, and the number of cases identified for the theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast and supermarket restaurants in the United States are being hit.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken" have been launched.
For now, no one dares to know whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and get together in its first stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a series of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wage received by Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For the time being, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Fridays". That day, in the United States, it was the beginning of the herding organ that captured millions of inhabitants, and that sometimes it was accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some Walmart corporate workers, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protests alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from clothes, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can allow the luxury of selling products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of assembly or hand scanners.
Those "Black Fridays" participants in the event demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in the consumer's shoulders, each visit to the store will result only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12,39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from the 8th of the afternoon of Thursday until midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their registration boxes carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" employees in Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"It's free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is no one), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for illness and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal law and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants will increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wants less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of the U.S. teenagers spent the McDonald's and worked there, behind the indicators, in part time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to eat with.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cheeses and cooks start paying them at least $15 per hour, that is, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from withholding this right and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for the trade unions to include the fast food sector.
One of the most important is the excessive rotation of staff.
Distorts
Ruidos protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place half the half in McDonald's located near Times Square, where several local politicians participated, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of millions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate to the mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the workers in the fast food sector in order to receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every neo-Yorkino deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the biggest manifestation of this kind in the American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people in New York labored.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy"
The topic of increased reality, so popular among modern technology lovers, is recently generally perceived mainly through the prism of special gases.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, Microsoft was supposed to have submitted an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a discussion with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was argued that for the scientists of that company, the cages already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of the handling of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the study object of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its large mass has been trapped in the work phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ago and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as they are all interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer technology must be freed from our, physical, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, you cannot be considered a panacea, it is up to you to resolve the issue of privacy, as you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each one in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device camera, but by a pulse recording the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Either you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have from modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects the man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful for me to work an equivalent of such a device, but it did not require contact so that the frames per second would be more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cams", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, he hasn't introduced his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased technology, gaffes are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from the gap to the smart phone,
The valves are very personal devices, in which is your strength (the private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on valves will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakdown in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactical sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Register the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at making these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger gives a similar feeling to which one feels if someone was supplanting it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrists for the doll that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, this too is a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of racing tapes (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as those of giant globes.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens facing, to the vanguard of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of San Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even being known by Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they want to be displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophytic historians of St. Petersburg, creator of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the San Petersburg vanguardism of the late 80s - the early 90s.
In addition, he is a urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts up all the state of soul.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he matured to do such a difficult role, because of his chemistry, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you going through the red city and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray causes aggression and agitation of properties to be nothing good.
But my provocations are directed to start a conversation.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became a friend of the artists of the new wave, with the later ones who were exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is already over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not for the letters.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to meet at the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an encouragement to many programs before the times of Hali-galivskik.
We told Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and acid customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the event.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Pajasos".
Paddles are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, but being that way now is painful and frightening.
But in the meadows everything is embalmed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a total and mandatory change in clothing.
Now they follow one by the clothes, oriented in the outside, but not in the person's inside.
And maybe that person should not even hand him a hand, but spit him in his face.
And deception will be eliminated when it changes its clothes.
We just saw you on the role of a city organizer.
Who better than me to be!
- All right, but can commercial art best be nice?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, to have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into manadas, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social area works.
And a cultural event goes 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marching.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to waste what you've achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they denied money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were all right, the kings might not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in San Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level that properly evaluate them and open them up.
Now he's enjoying the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our rocks it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art be fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from San Petersburg.
Light up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board depart in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little place to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
It began to address the reproductive problems in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of orbited guisantes did not differ in any of the earth’s varieties.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, Drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under pregnancy conditions.
We get a normal pollution as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this pollution has to find support, keep on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the pollutants returned at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants did not respond to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they would just die.
"And twice we managed to get the pollutants born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the pollutants in space.
The last time a biological miniarca flew to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion", only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies such as this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
However, unlike the small animals, man can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to those who, after long flights, have all turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In terms of zero fleetability, the cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
The water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its birth element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within her mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water.
At first, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In summary, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, women need pregnancy, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy abdominal and pelvis muscles are decreased very quickly, the capacity to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, trusting in the act of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give light in a special camera, this one will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress with a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring the Earth to a disabled person, to a totally unfit person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
In time, however, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships address a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Chief of NKU: The inspection of the "schwarc" system has not done with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is inflexible.
Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) said in an interview for Aktualně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mention Petr Necza's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on the paper, which is known as the "schwarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office which has an obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of Members, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we began to carry out some two years ago.
I simply say that European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this follows the legislation in force in each country and then practice in itself.
We have all joined together and, although control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can actually make this project? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, reducing and improving the limits, although this has not had such a positive impact.
The savings economy means achieving something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid wealth and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the auctions, it means that we are going to achieve it.
Maybe because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo", that those who want to find errors in the system can do it more easily than if the limits were as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in another way?
In how many offices, such as the NKU, there operates the Bundesrekningenhof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, is the only thing that in its case is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
The powers are also similar, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level, and in this respect it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
As a general rule, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately identified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of the inspectors?
That's sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it hadn't been, they wouldn't have had any benefit in cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the public procurement law mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, whereby we have made almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the rule is "adjusted" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which does not affect decision-making.
A system of this type will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that ODS would not trouble entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called schvarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on the paper. What does this mean?
Is the schwarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the Prime Minister of the Government can not prevent the performance of the Office which has an obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we're going to do like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the legislation is rather strict about how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate from the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads have ice plates, although most of them are transmissible
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transmissible, caution should be extended in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
The roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible this morning, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops down and oscillates between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snowboard is fine.
On the other hand, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters in the crests of the Metal Mountains.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to the cloud, according to information from the road traffic control centre in the region.
The R6 and the first category road in the region are now transmissible without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially at certain bridges whose surface may be frozen and resbaladiz.
In addition, all roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transmissible.
However, in some of them there are still layers of ice and snow.
Attention needs to be paid on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snowy layer can have been formed on the roads, informing the Roads and motorways Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas in the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can be produced in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokýh Mýta, and especially in the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There are snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoše and Orlyký hory.
There is a snowy layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Richnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between dusty and partially cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually oscillate between three below zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitional today in the morning, although caution should be lifted and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be ice cream, temperatures will be between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with cloud, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information from the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitional almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be ice plates.
The second and third categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transited roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partially desiccated snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the way to Videlský kříž.
The snow was removed by road operators during the night; on the Schumper road, about three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transmissible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Schumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-dried snow in the direction of Jeseník," a road administration operator from Šumper to ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night they came to Jesenicá also to their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the trails of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitional without restrictions, in the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution in the forest plots, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different plots at first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech Central Mass, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded by the mother.
Road operators have reported the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced in road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched along the way with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month it will come to the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to get caught.
In the music group The Tap Tap we prefer to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone or avoid the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-friendly act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The previous day, on 20 December at 21 a.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
It will be about the same time as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
Initially it was my idea, then we were drilling the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it'll be just the last, good, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The heroes will be linked together at the same time thanks to the special live broadcast on the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We make all our efforts to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to be interested in working with us and having fun.
What will the money collected at concerts against the end of the world be destined for?
The equipment for the educational centre without studio barriers, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the Civil Association Tap in Jedlíkkov šstav.
Students from Jedlíkówv school receive regular visits from teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers, and we make an effort to do so.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedlijkov štav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert, several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Prague Jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, I would like to complete it with events in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not very minimalistic, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is logistics and the organization of these trips?
It's not that hard how it might look at first sight.
There are five members on electric wheels chair, the chairs should travel in the luggage room and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far, we have arranged them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop me from surpriseing.
Even in Moscow, where we came back shortly ago, everything went out without problems.
You can compare the different attitudes of society to those with disabilities and other aspects by going abroad.
What have you found them with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there remains no frequency that a person moves alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as current as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going after...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their account in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever you want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectful society or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers arise, it will start to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedlíkkov štav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, touch, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovich says, we had a little of our hands (risas).
However, the popularity has not come to these last years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also allow for quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, which can be done in a different way.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, it's for the whole society.
Did he help you to be a demanding chief, as many people describe him?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be strict in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they realize they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently, The Tap Tap Group has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
Anyone who is willing and eager will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Prague Arena, the Brno Fléda and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without STUDEO barriers in Jedlíkkov štav, Prague, whose cost is up to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry in the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the former bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission over the years.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had already dedicated themselves to flying to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left independent assistants and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautism, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the moon's hidden faces.
In 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Regrettably, the author of the proposal was unknown and the project was not known.
It's not clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the training or for its braking.
Information on this training is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the preserved material, it is evident that the research has reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the Rohozinski engineer appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzhna and aerial rocket bomb", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautica (Polishe Towarzystaw Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the Problemy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowice, it was proposed to create a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautique.
Projects of artificial satellites had already been launched at that time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has aspired to be part of the International Astronautic Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA has become a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He performed this task until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe (Rakeita Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apex of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959, two stages of the RM-2 rockets in the Błūdow desert began the air tests.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket would be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket would have an apogeus of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed between themselves by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum landing in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space space space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional judge suspended the social herbajos law.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
Since then it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict among themselves.
The case is in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited private capital movement, together with the unrestricted financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in the labour cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut distances and thus "provides a lower price" of the competitor with the aim of making it with most of the market and thus increase its margin of profit.
To a large extent, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper or disappearing there. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsible for the unemployment this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the social expenditure of the state.
All of this makes for the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that no specific statistical data is required.
Unscrupulous practices in private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The objective is to compel the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially in terms of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help reaches the millions already.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public with regard to the situation of the German Federal Parliament's assistant employees.
The measures to save practically all states of the EU in the south lead, without doubt, to the same situation: people, forced by an absolute decline in their social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to abuse with a painful wage at the edge of society, hoping that one day it will arrive in the private capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for an infinite part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the wisdom that the state should not give capital to the economy, which leads to economic failure.
The private capital defends with needles and teeth thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by taking control.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political process with its selfishness and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clear.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in the very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in a legislation that is practically acceptable everywhere but is not punishable.
The situation in Germany is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting draft laws to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is later approved in the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like that described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations took care of the force."
In exchange for bribes, illegally obtained favores and aid for financing stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any obstacle and people went to the polls with the aparabated vote in advance"... "there were no people in character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, due to this disorganization, the state was eight months without consulates"... "The only remedy for such a serious situation was self-cracy and it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought in Pompey, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into self-cracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on unbiased preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is, in essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of the then, a decline in the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it deeply.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the free liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, pending the next coup.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnesses, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech Government will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which both strengthen the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his Fragile song and whose stribillo sings "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (we do not forget the fragile things we are).
"If my children didn't want war, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death bed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, different reactions have arisen as always.
On the side of Israel, he argues in favour of the right to self-defence and enlists Palestinians in the role of terrorists; on the other hand, he supports Palestinians and advocates racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and a terrorist attack on Israel.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the repeated killings and who is the victim. At the end of the day, the citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and did not live on the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been drawn for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of the Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main incentive for the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of the struggles for power is in the first line.
At each time we can find a Magno Alejandro or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who guided their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if anyone is still behind, I don't know, but I don't waste it): the Rothschilds.
It's not much written near them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the defeat of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of America of Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to demand the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
His afan by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating the great monarchy states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (such as the number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of the decommissioning of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to an worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the First World War was triggered, Russia was destroyed with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end with Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demise of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In preparation for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a conflict situation in a way that was covered by the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the best conditions for the radicalization of the poor masses. Later, they were able to serve the Germans the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple enough and pointed out guilty, and then to build a Czechoslovakian nationwide with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned earlier felt the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was the Second World War: it's hard to know whether Hitler took too much of the rope that the international bankers had attached to him in principle or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for accepting the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel being the focus for a third war.
If international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now with the Arab population or, generally, Muslims in the Middle East.
Israel is an enormous laboratory, a machine of soldering and chaos, not only within its country, but also internationally.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice create injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all it was the greed of some individuals and their appetite for the world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandate holders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do all they can to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the narrow of Ormuz, where 20% of the world's oil is passing (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-comforted financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls all of his being.
"And compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, who sums up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you're being cruel, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students took over the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the corrupt shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: taking the shah on board could not allow it, since if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., its destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran was a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck is the subject of an episode of this story, which had a little success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a very difficult period, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, thus helping a covert story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that was examining the country's location for the rotation of a super-production of fiction science.
Gender combination
The plan taken by the expert in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie look true, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, and the fiction production society even had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of different kinds.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper motion", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the mood states. We found well documented sequences of Tehran. In the credit sequence there are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were also placed in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: worn men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, at the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of jokes, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long metre, after "Adiós small, adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which action takes no place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of the old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is "rued" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time transmits the emotion of dissertation and the lack of predictiveness that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the taxing team in Tehran's base).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And they're set up pretty well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbreakable search after it becomes a madness).
Argo's flexicurity is the discontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very graceful role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses some dramatic traces, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it falls, it'll be hard.
As an expression of a real history and as evidence of the exaggerated notion that can be the notion of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflammation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"After the last event, the EU is planning to approve a 40 per cent quota of women in positions of leadership in large European companies," said Právo Patrick Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
There is, for example, a recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Naker reported.
Among the EU's controversial regulations, for example, is the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark direction of the size of gallin cages, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The actual ban on the use of the expression "mountain mantequilla" or the removal of the classic cotton of trade has been criticised.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including with the veto threat, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the top quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission has defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogeneous national standards to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive is causing a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement last year, according to which it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflam without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, globes are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction is also in force for the use of rabbits by children up to 14 years of age.
Interesting events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt Greece's sensitivity, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) must be spoken of.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved seed, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're undermining the fact that there's no sea.
We asked the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development, directed by Minister Pavel Niemec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often blank of criticism, EU regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, by the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always won the battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's rebate, but had to change their name to the national ron, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became "tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, together with the cheeses of feta and gorgonzola known worldwide, the German city of Lübeck or the hamlet of Parma, for example, are the tickets of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohorelice and Trebonj and, even, the variety of Žatec loops.
As protected maras from the EU, they may be proud of the Pardubice bread and the Horjice v Podkrkkonoší barrels.
People want to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you get the election to the president?
It's not about being senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how she has been robbed in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are being punished, taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon it has been headed to the presidency.
Isn't he giving the back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later, I had to say that if I were elected senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas reality.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but that we tread on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is accompanied by the media, which reproach you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I've been told that I've bribed journalists what I've been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the statement of ownership of over twenty million.
That's what the law has to change.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the leadership office can be recognized as self-employed, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Is a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get out of here.
I don't care if someone's left or right, I want to join people.
Always open support for any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It's funny when it's said that you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it by what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I speak about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, it is only given.
And this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, for example, will you get a criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convinced politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimise criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take the President's direct election, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just a fan, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I try to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I try to get things out myself, but if it doesn't go well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, because they're best encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For me, at least I have supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I came out of the base that people are really unsatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
The 60 per cent of the population did not turn to the polls and, those who did, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for this, to check the irrevocable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have any money.
I don't have any money or for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated 25 million land, an estimated 10 million floor, another eight million floor, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Superb Skoda valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you don't have any sponsor shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with my pocket money.
The campaign's costs are essentially what I'm going to get in terms of Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't present myself as a candidate.
So will you continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to leave this activity before?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partially abandoned my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my summer replacement.
People would like it to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much does it get to win every month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If he were president, then he'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic appearance, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a transeont passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to enter those fashionable libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a fugitive visit, shows the dubious honor of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges represented in euro banknotes in the form of decorated armored concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as the politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: it was necessary to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for the fun and cynic-based buildings, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared in the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was looking round and looking at their shoulders, Maas proceeded to collect the books by size, forming a pyramid, and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear conciudads:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is rising in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a mail office and a couple of residential and residential buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also appointed to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small city with no history, which so far had nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town after which a white façade would intrude rather a central dairy, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenie now has the first public cultural building of her history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
Well it is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this mountain mass, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully crystalline interior is bright and easy to cover with the sight, the collected brick floor and the elegant flags undoubtedly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park banks, the dogs and the children and girls playing football.
And on all sides books, books and more books.
"The books are usually available along the façade and in the center there is a huge dark room that usually is somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put your feet on the classic space configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well-used: on average there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental education centre and maintenance room.
Special mention is due to the black stands that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and rocking it at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, in a fresco farm, we meet with the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the winters and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness is used as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts for two seasons and then it is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was taken for the first time in such quantities until it reached four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 furs reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route, almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy a delicious Dutch croquets and their fig trees planted in huge macets.
These create a pleasant atmosphere for the pair that maintains adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is expensive to believe it given its large crystallized surfaces, this building is an example of an ecology project," Trouborst points out.
The heating and cooling required are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden rings located cross-sectionally to the crystal façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, the Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "slow soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way, the optical loops of a library that does not yet have its full file are intended to be filled; currently there are 70,000 copies.
The concept's been quiet.
The tanks are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all the inhabitants now have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to adore.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this royal discipline that in the specialized Argot is known as "the creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenie has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and unaware of what he can be.
Finally a starting point to match your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from setting up a flight ban zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that it is now reorientating its foreign policy, away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are in a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still trying their role, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the UN's vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to deviate from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you so much importance, since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in the German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a dramatic collapse as in the case of Libya.
Germany may have managed to gain some respect for this.
At the end and in the end, all this has not done but showed that it is a country seriously considered as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a gap between U.S. and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I believe that Obama's government has a great understanding of the European position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent assigned to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior body, but they must push things from their own position.
That's exactly what they're doing with the euro right now.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous subject.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or maybe it's still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it always turns out to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still costs it to play a more important role.
If we observe the crisis in the euro, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings emerge.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European politics is growing, but the EU does not currently cover this gap, who is left then?
Germans will have no more remedy than to take a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it makes them a more unpopular people, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China is hidden behind this name but it has nothing to do with original companies.
However, this enjoys protection while true eponyms do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them reason.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from the Taylor Wessing buffet, who specializes in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
The simulators simply add a few letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada it registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sports article manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archiver where he stores seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that of copying and violating intellectual property rights is of course known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. Because of its customers, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or the accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears, and the damage the image suffers is huge."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are millions, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is, in size, the third market in luxury goods and which is growing at a higher rate.
However, the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also entails a lot of money.
The processes can be extended for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had spent so much time that the claim's name had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the pester because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the forest.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that had recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of putzmeister concrete bombs.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that remembered BMW to a large extent; the case was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodral looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of the labour emergency has returned to normality".
Thus, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it would mean that China would lead the list of new registrations worldwide for a decade consecutive year, according to the brand office.
This also seems to be happening with the number of valid logos, the figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euro.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the simulator has managed to ensure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We have caused this situation ourselves because the names are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Adviser of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the use of munitions.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg the reason, but the opposite is still fighting at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where a resolution is pending.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue in a favorable way and commend the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files of up to 100 years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but failed.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler points out.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if the simulators are assured there of rights on unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long abandoned this trade area, but it was able to prevent registration.
"Wentzler must be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both him and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on brand rights, but what must be done is "to register in China all that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in case Freudenberg loses the last assault on his particular battle, then he would have to pay the party's right to a licence for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi chorus and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, taco shoes and mocasines seek the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then will the voices of the singers begin to rise slowly (contrary, low, tenor and soprano), shaking, stuttering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to sort out his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
The 50 singers, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a well-known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Auto-Help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme has around 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the town of Esiteni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month a child can be accompanied.
This contribution will cover the school record, the uniform and ensure a hot meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "historic storytelling" or "panegirist".
In this room, no one knows how to speak fluently this bantu language, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been teaching songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the kingdom of Suaziland, there is a village called Esiteni, which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some in simple brick and pajamas, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitje is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see with good eyes the circumference, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contamination by half.
More than 40% of Suaziland's inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something more than thirty years has become a habitual thing.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this revolving population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the opportunities in a poor country are more than few.
In principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
However, one year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Eisitnije.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial-derived ETS are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrea.
The most common viral ETS are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected persons?
The syphilis and gonorrhea are more often given to men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four out of every five syphilis cases registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (Hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has remained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms does it indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, trouble in urine, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or vertebrates.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer protection to a hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by uncleanness and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently from sex to sex.
If they are diagnosed early, most ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for its actions throughout Germany, there is a considerable amount of money to be recovered.
"We have already sent some 200,000 euros in Eisitje," proudly noted Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
The orphans find a good lodging, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and care for children to attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chickens, and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people of the village have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually spoken of openly.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "on any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
There is another culture, here only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings you an excellent environment and a lot of joy, but has also managed to start a couple of tears to someone other than a angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Exitnije, where the singers visit the child-accompanied.
Although this small population only appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.
"Accere to Exitnije, there the light shines," the people of the place said.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the trial halls of the Bergheimer street filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the closest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water, as it appears from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of thickness.
The water probably comes from comets or, very likely, from asteroids that in their day shocked Mercurius.
No one relates to the founding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwarranted for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.

Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "born" stars.
This region of star formation, called in a little romantic way by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This resonated image of an extinction star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring in the form of donut is made up of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Nebula Trifida, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture from the galactic star formation area.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebula of the Helica appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.

One of the largest and most neat photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebulosa located several thousand light years in the Sagitario constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), as dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
At the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carbola: 400 million years of light from Earth the two-galaxes cores in fusion process are blown down one to the other to end shocking irremediablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the name of the Australian Molinillo.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebulosa in Cefeo constellation.
The nebula, located at 1,400 light years, is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
Shows a black hole ring located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, known as Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the spiral galaxy larger than UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar training area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rose Nebula, new stars are also constantly emerging; at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have increasingly depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of the Grand Canarias Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its English-language stamps) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Eastern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also welcome the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Your primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to take images.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 global candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 to 2018 rocket.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers depart from the basis that there is also ice in the southern part of Mercurio.
However, no evidence exists, since the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the Messenger 2004 survey, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the assurance that it is.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years

There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strept through the sinuosa road along the forest hills, rivers of large waterfalls and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one could even think it's in the Black Self.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the "talyshi" live, a people who don't know much, except that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and that they are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumed of an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists only reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
It takes eight hours to reach the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this prosperous region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva points out.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have passed the 100 years. Fatulayeva points out a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the man of documented age lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day a glass filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly, people in the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many older people?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich food in the calorie of the talyshi, that they worship meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of which, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At its 97 years of age, it is relatively young for what it is up to these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wooden house in the entire Caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves inexhaustably a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, one of them sons and one of Mirzayeva's daughter, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play on the other side of two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that is served in a typical bowl with an abundance of tea.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and beneath the panel conceals two long drapes of dark ruby that your son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept your color.
"I've never used a shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always only eaten what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and sweeteners.
I've never been to buy a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar World War II.
However, everything went back to its hole when the "sweet father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a larger woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the worship that is practiced in the fatherly figure of the nation, which directs its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
It remained in power until 2003, the time when the witness presented to his son Ilham.
At least the older persons in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euro) in monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the elders are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is gathered.
The future constitution, with the sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape in patriotism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate title awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive her of her power in court?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been enforced by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are of genuine concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft is also said to be based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean by "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that it has appeared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunny Islamism.
It has no reason to be like this, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Most of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert a severe repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As established by the drafter, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate wording in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking of which, of course, it's nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacys.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits "the defence of people"
Is it enough for the president's cartoon or a joke about a letter?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago the opposition was closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cairo and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbai, who takes the third place in the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace and Exdirector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the cube of the trash of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When the referendum is convened, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," the Egyptian politician Chald Ali was quoted as saying in the media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country" at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters didn't want to risk anything like that.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamic wiper has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were imprisoned or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," she laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led to the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
It is felt abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian Racquel: the world's most illustrative fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the largest living standards, not only of Europe but of the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country will preserve some relationship with its greed for a very poor fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the aroma of rakfish, one of Norway's exquisites.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Raqfish is ground in salt that is allowed to be fermented in water for a year, depending on the malady you prefer, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this meal of the most, so to speak, the captivator.
"You eat raw and then drink a pot of aquavit from a stroke," says Havard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking important amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfish," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a lot of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Racquel is a product from a very different time, in which poverty has taken over Norway and in which, before refrigeration exists, the fish was kept during the fall in water and salt in hermetical barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it gets out and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they mainly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete social service system.
A stream of Swedish residents, the old rival and even makes not much more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Racquel is considered to be an important part of Norway's past, but rather unfavourable.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you the 10€ ($14) fridge each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news, and most Norwegians like it to be.
Here people are still not ready to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
The Norwegians are greatly encouraged to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After many of Norway's current wealth there is growth, from the beginning of the 70s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil isn't the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our comrade, as she went through rakfisk flags and that, with her long brown ruby and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like alarming, we don't like visualization."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the ticket well closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat racfish," he adds with a developed carcage.
I'm in the snow making a cup to eat something; I've already had enough raccoon.
Now a high burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he's back to that poor fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a Raqfish dinner is held in which the leaders vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nasal pits.
A television has been connected live with a presenter who has pajarita and is surrounded by Rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, has been installed since Monday a steel circle that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
Faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has had good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country has been submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has been charged for some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained in the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before coded with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was the governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous state with a rapid growth that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the buccolid town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are reminded with affection.
Its residents give you the merit of growing tourism in the place and construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads can be driven, which means a huge improvement compared to the rough roads and full of bays that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name in the entry of a modern polydeportive and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of Mr Peña Nieto's party, PRI.
"Partly, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbursed by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic man of state and, above all, he's a person who can listen."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have about its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast to the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico's own city.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhood and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than the city of Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that I could not deal with the problem of feminism while in charge.
Most critics accuse their administration of making the fat view.
In a hormone house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, along with a cross where a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says she has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old chismus, an abbot, a kayaking.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up."
"But that can't be so when there's been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says Prime Minister Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of City Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report bad treatment, the prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse while in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Manning in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while he was under military arrest.
During the interrogation that the prosecutor conducted in Manning in a pre-trial trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits by officials of the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a vision taken as a result of the defence's request that the case be dismissed as its imprisonment had been severe and that it had already suffered enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning is the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico's military prison, where he was imprisoned in a maximum detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the cells as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who had visited him had talked about these issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not left any comment on those issues in the register.
"They would write 'no impact' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would have mentioned no problem," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he had received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with an advice to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was under.
The military said that it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which was a degree below the possible suicide surveillance, to ensure its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the biggest state to know that I was good and (I wanted) to stop being under the prevention of injuries... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison based in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he had lost his knowledge because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he would not be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world only reduced to the Arafjon camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, after moving to Quantico, most days spent in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a cot, a blanket, a scarf, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to fall asleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the waiters couldn't see his face when they turned around at night, they woke him up so that he could turn around again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint on Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth's military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a complaint he had made in the Thursday's statement, which, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to remain naked in front of the cells and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the account.
During the trial by the judge on Friday, Manning said he withdrew from the order given to him by the cello who should have let the blanket fall with which he could have covered, but admitted that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said that he had told the officer that he might have used the elastic of his inner clothes or his self-esteem pens but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed his inner garment, his cheeks and his cheeks from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she has experienced during her stay in prison and dramatically reduces her sentence if she is convicted in the war council, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and the prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application of any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
Manning charges include cooperation with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, filtration of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face a permanent chain.
My Mexican-US Identity Crisis
He claims that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-US are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had only fallen by the explanation and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some signposts indicated the way to two hills: one for "Mexicoans" and another for "Exteriors".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in California Central, my whole life was called "Mexicon."
It's about ethnic tachygrafia, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends as "Italian" themselves.
Later I decided to "Mexico-US".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or script was not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish, as well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put me on the line of foreigners.
I thought at this time of the week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as with the leaders of these two countries, it was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the European Union style.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that they remember are everywhere.
So, at the moment a United States official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that of the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do we speak of resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many Mexican climbers living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogical tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to whom the door to the opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit in a certain profile: dark skin, low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans who belong to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States, but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that this rock exists between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know with greater strength who they are and the second ones are upset.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered a part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've understood during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect to the diaspora again.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues the amazing thing to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with the inequality of wages, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you'll be alone with this idea, my friends.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still reciprocated by how they treated their families much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another drop of blood that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to pieces; more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and for the first time missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional alborote.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their fatal death situation could be triggered.
A War That Neither Loses nor Wins
At first sight, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the halons of both gangs.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good strike.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated ruins on the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implodable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. It has also done so, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
The successful Hamas members say that the middle Islamic month is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbula military party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Mostly in southern Israel, the growth of Muslim brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay depot that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
On the other hand, Muslim brothers are the cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military issue, they have put Hamas on his side.
The Israeli Cup of Iron Anti-Missile System has shown its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended with the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that is being waged by the West Bank, the main piece of a country that aspires to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that international legislation is illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Lakud has joined an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman during the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why am I smacking those Palestinian retards by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they lift their head.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive Palestinians of their right to self-determination is to create a dust that one day will be exploited in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus this week has been exploited in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics is worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
The major missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic fee.
Both gangs need a push from people outside of the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one who prays to people with a sense of both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The short-term hope is that the high fire gives a little more impetus to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to achieve a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also had an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he neglected to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems as reluctant to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a closed green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of a green olive finish, a wonderful image of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick because they are children of smoking parents.
Except for the different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
This is the most stringent regime in the world applied to the tobacco package.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the features that make this habit glamour.
He believes in studies that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% of the chances that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not have much impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put an enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will lead to serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring the counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited since the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone pills and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a rejection of the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and that he was waiting for more stocks.
"For us, it's a good business."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in the eye, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted on foreign pages.
"If you're selling tobacco and you're just left with this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place you can be in," said Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase of reviews on brands from "people on foot" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked whether it is only a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new regulation implies than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unduly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering applying similar legislation on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more stringent laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Sinally, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, the manager of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them in the stands.
"It usually took an hour to unload a delivery; now I'm late four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's, well, we're done and we're closing the store," he says while he lifts his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year's Days of Action, I had to spend five hours in an airport unexpectedly because the plane we flew into had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boring.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts praise the kindnesses of boredom.
According to them, it's good that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Borrowing forces the brain to look for interesting options and may stimulate creativity.
As most of us are currently connected to this or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we take it with a good heart to be bored?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey says, Greek and Roman History Cathedral of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Livey History" ("The Borrowing, An Animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom dating back to the first century C.E.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raising the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but not able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
She says that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the change in the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense that time passes slowly".
Borrowing can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to concentrate on.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the Perspectives on Psychological Science magazine, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room containing a television program to any volume that did not keep any connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was only perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the volume below showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to be bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing garages, actions often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to combat it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to be more bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "treasure trend scale".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a kind of group that gets bored with quite ease.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said that they would be bored while at school or doing their homework, while 23 percent said that they would be bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would be bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultness is a period in which boredom reaches its highest rates," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of the principle: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, from the extreme, it can lead us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating them, as the research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boring is the way you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, it'll satisfy you.
But if you see television, you may be satisfied in a short time, but not in a long time.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And “this ability to dose applies to other situations”, he points out.
Your son not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really wanted to praise boring.
But neither should we be overly critical of him.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable sections of the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to be bored more, but boredom is a very anxious and worrying desire as to relate it to something that deserves the penalty," he says.
Note that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: no instruction book for the new marijuana consumer law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and soccer institute in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the locks near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a judicial quote for possession of drugs and related articles (lesser offences involving each of the US$100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And I am?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes of drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to submit charges against the 21-year-olds by small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district prosecutors have committed themselves to moving forward with cases open for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana shops, recently authorized in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also giving it back to the matter.
They continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences, all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will swim, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as maintaining a balance between the requirement of the state to offer "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of undertaking cannabis businesses on a radio less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"In no place will it be more difficult to place an authorized cannabis business than in the urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Center for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On 21 November Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to intervene in judicial proceedings for minor deficiencies in the possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to present charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for implementing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, North Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck is a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he ensured that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and that they were determined to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to intervene in judicial action against the offences that occurred at the time of the crime," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest county city, no longer cites adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending.
"I don't think you're wasting your time continuing to enforce the law until this change," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictory reactions from all over the state show a marked ambience among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've been taking us so long before the courts that, in fact, they still can't accept it as legal," he said.
When the first states consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases at the national level with regard to the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders for the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will arrive early.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not take down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, reactions will likely be shown to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an excessive drug policy officer of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it would be about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in favour of what the state voted for."
There are many questions in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been beaten up by Oxford for being a Tory."
Not attacking university students for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life when I wasn't dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupying my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to race history, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal in my life.
My father fell apart and went away crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because I didn't tolerate some college associates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in unscrupulous cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because it came from a private school.
I was told for a single reason, which in the cone of the supposed illustration turned out to be something intolerant and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on right now.
Well, a number of reports indicate that a new generation of students from the right centre is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the conservative party students is such in Oxford that last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduates) of the Corpus Christi College affirm that they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as unfree persons" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college in order to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on students' politics and presenting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a plated suit and a bar with silver impoundation.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" because of the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Conservation Party Association of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, the elected president of OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the right-wing people has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the welfare of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, and I was a young 18-year-old in terrible shyness.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honor cause" after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have caused any Stalinist to panic.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students met and met the cathedrals, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I found that not only did the cathedrals make a fat view of the mofa made by conservative university students, but they were happy to participate in it.
The policy of the strike of miners, the privatisation and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminary's wooden halls.
The first to attend was to translate French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Séñorita Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now failed), "please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know one.
Pitt, a man down with a face that looked like a bizzoch mass, knew well how to throw out bad biles.
"Is it that the sorceress refuse to learn French or is it that they're just stupid?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
I was blinded by the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy getting to know people," said Pitt.
I returned to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight palm tree in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who was introduced as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They're messing with anyone who's suspicious of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Many Tories have just arrived to appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student from Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I've become a pervert dirty.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"They give each other a thumb, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after the night?
Should I be a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
Tory was the only open cathedral, Norman Stone, professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him not only from the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place for which he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a cathedral at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy," he said.
I started to move daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear sleeping needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
Her painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they only made it to joke.
I would have broken my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar where another cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was an "enemie of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "the stupid old ones."
The strike lasted a little while.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career at Oxford.
That's why my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was surrounded by fear and, past five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When the bags were made and I picked up the first train in London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party, but, to this day, it is hidden behind a reputation worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that gathers more than 130 high-cost clothes created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colphon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino always has a sense of fascination with the distant and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Shantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches such personal memories as trophies of his social rise: of humble modesty in the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the icon of the international "get-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't turn off their pickles on your magnificent carpet like they do some beautiful pop music celebrities," says Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet at Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of beautiful forgotten such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modest.
Many years ago, after a demonstration in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Coast Week of Paris in 1995.
"Never goes fashion because your designs are art works," he says.
Alcurnia Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamourous 60-metre passer that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to slide through the passerby to contemplate a "hearing" of the dream that shines the master works of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Nette", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Farah Diba Empire.
In that public of manicures they highlight names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of those clients say the first Valentine is like the first love, "not forgotten."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a dress "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love to women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former duke of Feria.
I like the colors you use, they have great light and they're "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampo can forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed of coming to have the age and the opportunity to use one of your night clothes...
Finally came the time at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with fold of wings, draped "corsage" and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made real," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress of the modest party with "the best care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work were needed and 25 "girls" (as the modest calls their ribs) were needed to develop that marble silk suit with pearl incrustments, twelve different types of fittings and a four-metre and half-metre tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a hit of the high cost of late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obtained for years with the "savour-being" of the elite, Valentino is now his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of its clients.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his clean and perfect appearance," acknowledges D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest office: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom your work is one hell and another who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking the sugar out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the earth’s guts is solidified when contacting the air.
After starting big sugar rocks, which in total reach about 70 kilos, they are loaded in two bamboo baskets that are loaded on their shoulders through steep stone trails.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the worn-out carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb the tortoise step, keeping the balance and gently measuring their steps so as not to get rid of and fall down the precipice.
They know that any crossroads could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who had been exposed to the risks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euros per kilo of sugar they extract
Once above, there is a passage between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatigued by heavy canasts, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 hundredths of euro) per kilogram of sugar.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whitewash sugar.
"As usual, we carry 70 kilos, we pull out about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) each trip," explains Anton, who usually performs three daily ports.
Three hours late in each and it's wet, but it allows you to gather 138,000 rupees (€11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would win in the field.
"The newspaper of miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) on the day and the monthly average salary is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier, who previously worked as an albañil in the island of Bali.
There, its salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but then returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is as overwhelming as the azuffer: "I married a young man from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam".
Then he has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes get irritated by the toxic gases
At 27 years of age, then he takes three playing the fight in the Kawah Ijen, whose azuffre has already begun to pass his bill despite having to cover his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that release the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," she promises in a more acceptable English.
Punished by life, this young and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, cameraman or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day to the two of the morning because the sugar doesn't stop driving at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Desperate of the shadows, then down to the crater amber with a little light attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sugar baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its sharp benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of asbestos to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their behalf and at both weights.
In fact, they are not even part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) of camera refurbishment, which, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros), the keepers of this natural park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
"This job is for animals and not for people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, ensures he will continue to work "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, from 18 to 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes improvisingly and traps the miners in thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of having serious diseases... more, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and joints in the shoulders, which have been damaged by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the canaster on your back, Uninik can already load only 50 kilos at its 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur on the volcano, which three trucks transfer to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the curse.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of their five children, the older one, 30 years old, also works in the sugar industry.
Time passes, but the eternal misery of generation one of the world's toughest offices: what makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore searches for babies to save the economy
Singaporens blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
These verses may seem to be part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore in the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We're going to put a bath (blow) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform "his national duty".
This is pure Internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating candles.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What is not taken so lightly is Singapore's government.
It spends US$1.300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the preservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a repossession rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites where xenophobia abounds only spread against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who criticize for maintaining low wages and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and recordings for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoe box, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and have had a lot of success in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "slip boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
It admits, however, that the new rules give clearer guidance to the developers, who were previously being harassed if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the similar centre that will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are face-to-face, and so is education, so many people are putting it down," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to count on my own money and time," another young man of about 20 says.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, for as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babysitting, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private offline is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy, it is the private quality or "the sphere of private life which is entitled to protect from any introduction".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating online situations that would probably not be shared offline?
thePeriodic interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not lead them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They are very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I'm also interviewing my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or of someone who's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscenious photographs of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I open Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just pick them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't mind anyone recommending a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admission not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated him or asked him for the address of his home or phone number.
"If I'm pressured or demanded just the bags of my account," he admits.
José followed Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
To the boy, the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying are not unique.
A friend of mine was harassing him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who he was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"I only gave you privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I'm sick or I'm hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks should be to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he said.
Perras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master at the University of Yale, and author of the Nativ and Digital Immigrants work, met these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, while we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to publish, or to say to an age that maturity does not give for it".
"They are also selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," she adds.
Then, Fucker lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you as you published it from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag photos of parties, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they should act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, equally must be on social networks," he says.
Watch
Esturdo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and educational consultant, notes that it is essential that family parents read the policies of social networks to their conscience.
By understanding each of the paragraphs, they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to the Guardian, it is important to remind children of the lesson of "not talking to strangers".
Finalize Unasur Summit without publicizing the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur) today concluded in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandate holders.
Efe tried to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellorry and Presidency indicated at the beginning that it would be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
In consultation with the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day alone, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information he circulated among the reporters was provided by the press spokespersons from some of the Governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which resulted in the spread of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media requesting more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South-Arab America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the insistent demands of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration was also not disseminated.
The official ASPA website can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the maximum information available.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Hague Court to establish a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piniera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which began Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process presented by Lima against Santiago.
"We will accept and execute the judgment which defines the differences we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with her Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a respected country of international law, a peaceful solution to disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñara added, and greeted Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the JIU occurred after Colombia this week denouncing the Bogotá Covenant for which it had agreed to submit to the cases of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the talks in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after midnight in Lima.
The Mandate read the final document informing that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, Internet access at low prices in all areas of South America, and to respond jointly and efficiently to the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should be used to expand our productive matrix and view a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-sectional axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its re-integration to the South American Union", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to maintain itself as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was hoping to meet with his couple from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the sea difference in a respectful way after a failure of the IGC, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
In that regard, it advocated the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of the Unasur.
"There must be free mobility of citizens and workers from any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also showed support for the recommendation of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of undermining the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who give the headquarters are never committed to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," said the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa made sure that she was not repentant of that decision because she did not betray her principles, but respected her “deep democratic values and human rights”.
He added that, at the time, "there were grounds for suspicion that Assange was extradited to a third country and that its process should not be respected".
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be investigated in its territory for a alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish law itself allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health is deteriorating.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian envoy.
What there is is the danger of damaging your physical and mental health because you are locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the equatorian embassy in London, through the granting of a life-saving guide that allows it to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there has been discussions with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures at different European institutions," he said.
And he thought, "If Britain's safe conduct tomorrow, this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow itself this problem ends.
Correa used to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what she did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil faith and the lie, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists according to profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "no longer the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it went on to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay at least until its next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legal golpism" because in fact "destructed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the fall of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited from Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
There is no such failure at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to process them in a broad way to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute that remained in the same court in Peru and Chile and considered that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit themselves to accepting failure for whatever hard it is".
In reference to the possibility presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if she loses the 2013 commissions, she will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and we're out of public life there.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and said that he was traveling to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health status," he commented.
The head of Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (UNASU), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb fell on me," he said, recalling the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "more softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such effort he already celebrated his birthdays 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, to the director of an IMSS clinic, he avoided getting rid of him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of your disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "caught" its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the incidence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV Unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after stating that this information was dropped in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immunological system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with the best expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that the person who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "while he is in control he can live without problems until 75 years of age," the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the Mexicans' life expectancy today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died since the onset of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Jalisco died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why is there still death?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a lack of medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, or in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of every ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore they have to offer mass detection tests to all those who require it."
In its proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to the test for a particular laboratory, only because he had made it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I better go back three times a week," they say, "not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today who are afraid within the framework of the World AIDS Day.
That the test, if they were at risk, that among the sooner they know if they are positive HIV, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the AIDS scourge this 2012.
Conjunctions behind the indicator
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tobacco journalist who has assumed the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are people today who still don't have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with slums and judgements of value of social workers, school mentors, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured.
It proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only follow the indicators and those hundred are found in public bathrooms from sites that young people frequent.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying their heads and motels, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if he would have been given condoms in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, the best is to approach condoms who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual path, 6% to the blood path, and 2% to the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about a recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scene puts a precedent to any national company with branch offices in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures under which Mexican laws are allowed to survive are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical area, the spade to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo of their properties abroad on Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to approach the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Failures Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial tender processed in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was established, with the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the vote of the inter-company, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts which the Vitro subsidiaries had with their matrix, the majority of those required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
The possibility, however, is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's not the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are an average of dozens of examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts have been covered by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, the "boutre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data omits the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, this guilt to Vitro of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to the relief of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, bringing his collections to the country.
Soon, the signature of the González Sada family will intervene in a review proceedings before the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote can be filled, that is, the five magistrates, given that they voted only three.
If it does not prosper, the Court of Justice of the United States will be called upon to review the proceedings by a superior body.
The serious case is that the court signed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Mercantial Competitions Act, noting that it was derogated with the agreements signed by both countries to embody it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is to say, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General's Balance
For several months, the complaints filed by the Mexican Aviation Trade Unions against the company's ex-wife, Gaston Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottle neck.
The case headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just brought a criminal case against the National Banking and Valuary Commission to whom it is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank IXE's F/589, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million weights.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Search Dragon Mart
Assembled at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members in general of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the launch of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a colosal center of sale and distribution of face to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the country of the wall, with a football accommodation area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the south-east area to oppose the monumental thing that dragged away part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the shelters against the industry.
ACTA died
Underlining a request by the Government of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Commercial Anti-Falsification Agreement, known for its English-language stamps as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action was taken in spite of the fact that the Senate itself had downgraded the possibility of considering it as an assassination of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In addition to paying long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million weights.
The issue is the first of four identicals that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Nace Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, information technology leaders, have just been born a consortium with competitive social reasons, whose goal will be the market for services of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the matter exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The balance has been my life"
Trotamundos of the "Hetin" Reyes Balloon Héctor was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the table and, thanks to him, travelled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of lower categories, player of the National Superior Ballpoint, captured and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Federation of Balonesto.
"I put many hats in my life through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit from First Time to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The balance has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making such an adjournment.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memorials that mark your wide trajectory, thus testify to it.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, the most exciting ones are the ones who commemorate their step by the Vaqueros since the mid-1980s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old acting as co-powered or mastered by the Frankish.
"These were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros champions since 1967, he was already a prisoner, co-founder or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five racing championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired with one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut in the BSN.
From then on, it was called "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong 6" 7 player.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros champion with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already far away, as it was already a federal mandate in 1988.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the U.S. during the 1989 Preolimpic period in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World, where we arrived fourth and must have been bronzed not to be by that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like he won the 2004 Olympic Dream Team.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to what we won the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, to the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar), and to Mario "Quiyote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and a young Rolando Hourruiter in replacement of the players suspended by the Panmerico de Mar del Plata line, we won gold against all the forecasters.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Picculín did.
And that doesn't count on his trajectories in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Ariel's work very much.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season at the beginning of the 1990s.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other islands of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory and course certifications for executives, table officers and arbitrators.
That's what I'm happy for.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, that has always been with me.
die the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a man of business without scrupulous, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the giant oil predator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producing house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, representing once again the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
I was happy for everything I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll surprise him very much.
"He was an original person and lived the most life," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and leads her to live with him in his home.
He was also a leading player of two comedies that were not long in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million TV viewers tuned it and converted it to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. embittered her and then threatened her with becoming a prostitute unless she was outside the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and a unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Major Victoria, a co-portagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "enormous, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have the luck of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already completed the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was no immediate statement by Warner or TNT about how the Hagman loss will be managed by the series.
Oriento de Fort Worth, Texas, was a son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stelared classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was married to lawyer Ben Hagman in 1931.
He was lucky in the New York theatres early in the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought I was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to visit the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some consolation, like "I'm not afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but it'll be okay."
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistable angel: The end of the "large regressive account" of the Maya Calendar on 21 December, to which many people have come as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dedudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theologians of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that ever happened," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days old and counting, this has been a really good time.
And they remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker is taking part in the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could break a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compared them with examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vucker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made teams to take a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "minor ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the Eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any option but to work "until the same night that the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturates in two hours," said Restal on his course for students on average, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of people who were wondering if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in some ways discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a last-year student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which rises to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who was teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception to a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal noted that many days of final trial have been spoken over the years, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or to think that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period in the end of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several people said they were thinking about going to parties at the end of the world.
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
