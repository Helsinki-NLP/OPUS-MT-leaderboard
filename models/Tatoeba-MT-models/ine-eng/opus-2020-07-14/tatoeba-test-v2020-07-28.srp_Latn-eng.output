I'm sure it was a coincidence.
It's a living being, of course it sucks.
Tom can write nice.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's gonna get better.
Tom's working on the marketing.
They're a quantum of the limes of the breathing instruments.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little touched.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps knocking like she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did all that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish his job on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How long am I gonna take?
I'm squeezing you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes to his head, if you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as smart as his brother.
Tom's on his business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where did you get that scar?
I wouldn't think of her appearance, but she's talking about a kid who ate two cake from her childhood.
I can't live like that.
Tom's hungry as a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everybody's crying.
October Paul was right.
He loves football a lot.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.

Do you think games and learning are connected?
I think it's all funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your year of car?
Account, please.
Make sure the cat's out and the door is locked when you leave.
It stays to see if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom got his fingers on the table nervously.
You look pretty bad today.
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
You need to thank Tom for his letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.
You should let me in.
The eternal snow doesn't look that long.
They're not mine.
What I saw was discouraging.

Tom retreated.
These monks live in the monastery.

Even a chief detective like Tom can't handle all the problems without the help of a colleague and a collaborator.
How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
We have to get rid of Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work in the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be rich like Tom.
Another store will be opened in Boston soon.
I was shocked.
Tom's being kind.
Tom told me this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
Can you save me some cookies?
I have an allergy to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not leaving this.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I drop it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because he's a man of shovinist pigs.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thank you for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I have no high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where did she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved safety procedures and are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
Frankly, I'm not even sure I'm right.
Don't fight.

The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Does any of your friends play guitar?
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is the photo of trains so interesting?
I put in every test.
I'm sick of your hair.
There's only one way out.
Which brother did you see?
I'll see.
Now he's very busy.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kyle Minov since 12 June 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
The danger of squeezing on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 in the morning.
You're becoming unwarranted.
Do you have to make that much noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a dirty year.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Get in touch with Tom.
What we had was special.
You need to write a novel.
You can't escape from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom's holding up.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
The dog house is new.
I got an e-mail in French yesterday.
Why are you so paranoid?
He's like a spitting father.
Tom's got his fingers through his hair.
I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be okay.
The family had dinner in the afternoon.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
He'll clean my room.
Tom and I are not friends, we're just workmates.
I don't see who it is.
Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were cold like ice.
One day it'll be mine.

Don't stop.
Tom managed to escape right on time.
I like watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really glad I'm here.
I can't answer your question with any certainty.
God save me!

Let's talk about possibilities.
I'm already going to suggest you do that.
She decided to go and study in the United States.

The text is very recast.
We're all trying to win.

I could go with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Mediterranean Greben - mountain wedding at the bottom of the ocean, in the depths of up to 4,500 metres.
Yes, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a sample?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She stood up and came to the window.
That was something that led to the blizzard of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She's an intruder.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a couple of black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.

Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your vision if you keep playing games.
I'm an Earthman.
I can read different languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
I'll need time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna make a fuss.
Somewhere you're right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened them.
Go straight.
Just like a doll.
I've got a lot of things going well.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'll leave school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The gap between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That's a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't do too much!
I'm proud of this team.
He's speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequence.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write for?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after seven nights.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to shave.
How much money do we need?
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Tom lives in the center of town.
Don't be a jerk.
Now things are a lot different.
I'm so interested.

I really like your music.
There's no business here.
Can you please tell me how to get to the airport?

I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
You're infected.
We need your help.
Has Tom been informed?
Tofu's going well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not swimming.
She's beautiful like her mother.
You have a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Get in there.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of movement of continents, because it was so hard to imagine that the motions of the panels were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I reacted instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I expected this to happen months ago.
How often do you upload photos to Jutjub?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply hurt.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining.
Tom's sick today.
That's what both of them like.
Is it dangerous when melanoma spreads?
I'm sad I'm leaving.
Tom, you almost got it.
They're the ones who want to go.
The teacher explained to us what the poet wanted to say.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Get in there.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's in bad love.
Start counting.
You can never come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his flaws.
I expected this to happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom's not writing to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called a favor, and if it's advanced in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would like to stay.
Tom just got sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
I'm here for you.
That's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut the fuck up.
Show me the documents.
I still mourn the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?
She must be over 60 years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this on our own.
I'm on Tom's side.
You almost caught ans a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's wedding friend.
Plato is a friend, but he's a true friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a painter.
Do you understand what I mean?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're right.
They can never accomplish it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom's laughing at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you pull the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
That works inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied his belt.
It seemed yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firmly against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.

What's your problem?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's at the meeting.
Don't fight.
Just watch out for Tom.
I'll get it.
I'm in a better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain that to you in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
I'll call her tonight.
She was a crazy year.
It's too late, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Here you go.
It will last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife is not sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's make some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I expected this to happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore that country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
Excer's been through the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There's a lot of galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain?
I bought some supplies.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was Lelyn's own dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultra-loved air are the kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher is angry if he or she has too much to teach in less time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope there'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How can I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I only listen to you.
He's rarely angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Have you washed the dishes?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was chased by the nightmares.
I made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't bluff.
Are you right?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potatoes salad.
Everybody else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It's hard to deny long-term love from one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We have to respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you at 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland with me?
Why is the photo of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you eating at all?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother's a Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's nobody like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The widowes are cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come and play with us.
Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
Tom's here this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get undressed.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
It took four kilograms of gold to swallow the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to know the numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man you're in?
Do you want to talk to Tom about me?
We need to work right now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met that one.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We're just gonna follow you.
It's very hard to know yourself.
Save your energy, you'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You're just shot.
My income has decreased by ten percent.
It could be hard to visit the unknown area.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, I finally made things.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I've been wearing shirts on short sleeves for years.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poem he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis' hat?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just leaving.
She spends three dollars a day for lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is a hockey country on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do that if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt a very unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Merina's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never saved that before.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm sick of the fight.
I've got enough room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
The music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Just slow down!
I pretended I don't know what's going on.
My friend got 95 points for a math test.
Tom didn't let anyone else in the room.
It's better than force.
They're waiting for you.
There is no "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Don't worry, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what to do.
I didn't say anything.
Tom didn't make friends easy like Mary.
I expected this to happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me the dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's only talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown up so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one's fast like you.
I agreed to buy it.
Am I just going to a party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I never should have interfered with your stupid business.
We've been working together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I had something to do.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Mer's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
Theirs is the right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman's eating bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be going soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid the dependency on the color classification.
I liked that guy.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you smile at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were touching her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom walked around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I ran into an empty cage.
Take a break, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come back sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose the beauty.
Look at the size of it!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were raping her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in the suit, behind the black big piano with dramatic moves, creating music that is very nice to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches from the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
A path to a man's heart leads over the belly.
It's time to get up.
The house is built by bricks.
I didn't write this.
I can't but feel partly responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of his cousin now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come on in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
To get to the mountain, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom's stuck.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you a little later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told him.
I'm still working.
Fat, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like to be with you.
The police work is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's studying very fast.
You're different.
She's a stranger to the hate of others.
This will make our work much easier.
He loves football.
Monas have been able to play tennis in the monastery.
Nobody trusts him anymore.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Who's Tom?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
A ride to work from hour to hour.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think such views are pure madness.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write a letter to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We need to understand.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom drew a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come and play with us.
And it was only with great pains.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points for a math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How smart!
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
They give apples and cakes, not gold and green woods.
I'm resting my feet.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What's this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's encrypted.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This has come for you." "Oh, you remember the one that you sent when you asked to give you pictures of Epljek's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mek's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mek." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philip's srafciger is convincing, but not misleading; and that Reit strongly charges things that I think should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I avoid that?
I'm only going to church with respect to my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He's on a stick before he gets into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom gave up college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom is talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your beating.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have collapsed and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's reached her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand a lot of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
Two sides will keep talking this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gypsum.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That's what needs help.
Defend yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Can you get a knee?
Don't touch the lion while he's asleep.
Tom's invincible.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
That's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot the bear.
I'm sad I'm leaving.
He's the king of birds.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you misunderstood this.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat lay stretched all over the length of the sun's light passing through the window.
Are you going to school on foot or a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't really impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon is a beautiful face and young body, a passing value.
I saw a mouse.
Try it.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That's what it takes to sleep.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I've responded instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was bare chests and bosses.
She's right outside my league.
What are we actually looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Teheran?
Let's take a look at that again.
It sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what we need to do.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Take the rope!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
It's worth twice, one cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom proposes.
If you want to talk to many people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is also nice and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Have you been sleeping?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could that have been Tom?
I have three beautiful granddaughters.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You never get there in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't get too big.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You'd better think when you're asleep.
Are we all here?
Turn around.
Tom was crying out of pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've done it.
I'll sign it.
Shame on him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like a science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
Frankly, I don't know.
I hope it'll be okay.
The wind calmed down.
In the bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I'd remembered that.
Don't get me into it.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The Czech festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy's talking like an adult.
The Sharks cost three dollars.
My bike's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
That's what I've already tried.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how you make yourself important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate biker.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm busy at work.
Tom's family moved a lot.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't be silly.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the man Arap or Hindi handsome?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He snuck up again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you cough, yell, or yell.
Tom's got his fingernails.
He was a man who never hesitated to resist.
It is likely that the periodic onset of anger is due to the fact that floating ice from Siberia can wear polar foxes on them.
I heard you didn't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having trouble remembering lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Who's that, is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the papers say?
The sun's surface temperature is about 6000°C.
He himself asked a lot of questions about Islam.
If we leave right now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to find out what really happened.
She's been through her hair with her fingers.
Tom is working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm starving.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom?
I'm not afraid of old age.
I don't completely agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I like watching you play.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurt?
Ole, the oldest cave in the world, just died, he was about 150 years old.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put your breakfast on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know I'm painting like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had problems with solving that problem.
I don't know what's not, still or just before, it was good, but more times when I tried to log on to the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually work happy?
I went there with my will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The fugitive from the prison was quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at that time.
I sent a map to Tom by fax.
These days, I have trouble remembering.
Tom may not make it to the meeting.
Tom died almost the same time.
The judge slammed it with a hammer.
They also found that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't bluff.
You should be able to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the lease period is extended beyond the contractual period, the proportional rent supplement shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination be at your disposal.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom keeps more than 80% of what he's doing.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
Wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get undressed.
It's not all the gold that shines.
Are we all here?
We have to focus on our vertebrae.
How fast!
Vera can move mountains.
I don't give up!
Tom fell off the truck while feeding irvass.
Tom became a dancer even though his parents were wearing it.
I think we've met before.
I was wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's a betrayal.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm more jealous than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little touched.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned the trigger on.
Tom always smiles at me.
She rarely, maybe never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating at all?
He's so weird.
I'm pulling a line here.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
Which school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They've all escaped.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to write the composition again.
You want to get on with it?
I knew I shouldn't be stuck in your corner business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really so happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said is a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
Saosam was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the observer.
How do you feel today?
That's why I need a reason.
Okay, what's the secret?
Shall we start soon?
Did you see me dancing?
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.
Tom managed to escape in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just hit.
I'm here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay their hats and clothes.
Does he look at me?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan?
You're supposed to be here at the latest in half of it.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Nile horse in the zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of speech.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two pieces.
Muriel is 20 now.
Did you eat anything?
Have you gone to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window's from the glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better a devil you know than a devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
Tom's a bookie.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, only if they get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're rocking.
I thought you were married.
I'll somehow find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bow in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Let's have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish hospital.
We'll run to the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was kind of weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
Everything was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't hang up.
It's bedtime.
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a fine?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How do you feel?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you think can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm so sorry.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows everything about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with a lot of talent.

Tom was Maria's first love.
The proposal was delivered by a vote by raising your hand.
Tom might have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm deaf and I'm not alone when I eat.
You look fat.
You need to learn English step by step.
That's better now than it was before.
Tom and Maria are different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me a question about who's going to win the race.
A man has many desires which he does not really want to fulfill, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment to him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would yearn for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's keeping an account of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
There's news.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom got married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is the photo of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a fool.
What are you planning on doing this flight?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betov wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Markus's house.
It's really bad enough.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house where Ataturk was born in Solon.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up-down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in first order.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to get my pen back.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What'd you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals tortured animals inadvertently.
How long are you gonna get angry and yell at us?
How important is that?
Do we want aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play uculles.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom confessed.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom got sick.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always the way they seem.
Show me the pictures!
It's necessary to tear down a few old houses.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going?
This report is not written very well.
She insists that this last move of the government has multiple meanings.
Tom's here this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to get used to sun cream.
Tom didn't try to deny Merina's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost all his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll owe you one.
A student from Oslo who falsified his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I'd like that to come to my mind.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I look normally happy?
I'm not a problem, but all these fatal questions and explanations of words are driving me crazy!
He's here this weekend.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a hit on luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean it up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned so hard.
Get back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How can I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into it.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
He's gone straight.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started to learn English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not in that. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tunes of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Down!
Tom couldn't bear it.
Anything you remember can help.
That's not something to worry about.
I understand that they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just a mess.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place clean as much as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel it.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He learns how to do it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom is the one you want.
He won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right on time.
I'm sick of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
They should be on fire.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
That's just how it happens.
Take a little.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know any question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be rewarded with a proportional share of annual interest payments.
Tom bought the time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of extraordinary.
In theory it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
It's almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's upset.
Remember the filename before you try to revert the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is free.
Let's get to work.
I wasn't worried about that.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
There's a lot of things going on in my hand.
Tom wants his children to learn the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't be a bastard.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom draw a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer provided great support.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It just happened here.
I don't know well Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've been hit by a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you like some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I put in every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with lots of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I only wrote this song for you.
Have you read the Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as an e-mail?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was nice.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved forward slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't stare.
It's blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honest man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Map, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives a god behind his leg.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have a problem like that.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
It's been a hard day for you.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is that true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be completely satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you have a test?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Have we agreed?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom's gone there.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom's been whispering to Mary and she's smiling.
Can I take a look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a bit of an error in knocking.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're not both rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a nice garden.
The coffee cup broke my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a bad hair.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you turn the bomb off?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language.
How do we manage others when we cannot control ourselves?
Don't hurry.
You can learn, no matter how old you are.
He dedicated his life to making a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and for others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who did you help in the early days?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I avoid this?
What do you want me to write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
Lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Follow my sugar, please.
It's nice to need someone.
I hope we get this.
We all have to face this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open.
Give me the sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in participating in the building of an intensive academic plan for programming.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used her walking sticks to help her climbs and falls on her way.
The compass shows up north.
Don't talk.

Which initiative did this take?
Finish this.
What do you want me to take?
I like cable food.
Where's your friend?
When are we gonna start eating?
The queen and the king have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
The flowers were completely introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
The blue is good for you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said she would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd accept it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislodged the right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive slowly.
My right hand's broken.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
She told me one bird.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I quit.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between persons of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought them bread.
We'll try your way.
Serve yourself.
You deserve me to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary from it.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everybody's gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame on her.
I got two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger from political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still think the Internet is no place for children.
That was hard on me.
What'd you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little girl.
Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd accept.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees fall in time storms in our neighborhood.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think writing is going very well.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
That's a lot of help.
I filled the glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning Mary went all over the village.
The voice spread rapidly.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It's helping.
Smoke slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm so uncomfortable.
The cost will rise soon.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they doubt me?
What are you supposed to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The winter has passed, spring has come.
It's really so simple.
Since those papers were written about the fact that no farmer wants to work as a buyer in Westfold, the interest has grown.
I'm punished.
I have to get inside.
We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen the UFO?
You're on my way.
It's getting dark.
What's a big secret?
The police are chasing me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask teachers every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't what it is now, I could trust everyone.
Three wounded, who are currently unclear about their condition, were evacuated to the U.S. Polish hospital.
I prayed for you.
Eteryum and bitcoin are encrypted.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see it work?
Is that yes or no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, the general precautions to avoid infection with this type of patient are valid.
I'm a free man.
I don't like people who're too thin.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be weapons.
I can't fix my car on my own.
I'd better go with Tom.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips burst into a bad smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mer's enthusiasm for the course fell when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous when he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb at Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
Smoking is not allowed here, it's your cancer somewhere else!
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I couldn't even close my eyes.
Was Tom here when we came?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to dream.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't come near my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you mean that?
Little kids like to have all of them pee.
She smelled the hair of the papillotines.
He's released from military service.
My right blood.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge sets us free and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you get them out of my way?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's made of an elephant's jaw.
You told me not to lie.
He was a former member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm scared.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question of what's best, because it's always individual and depending on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year of perfection.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The moons with the most rains are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually look happy?
I've already written part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the document.
It has to do with what...
That can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Have you finished washing the dishes?
Only I can do it here.
Tom will pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their native talents.
I'd go.
You're very rude.
You failed me.
There's snow on this mountain all year.
I don't think you should hang out with anything these few days.
What's in nature forever, when it's all so passing?
The engine's getting warmed up.
See you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You've created it well.
All you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets our email to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of this?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Investigate them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll be going to sleep in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent to laboratory testing.
We were walking in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was watching the neighborhood.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and decorated in personality so strange, cruel, and stubborn that a little who had decided to cooperate closely with it.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is Indonesia's most secure city.
Tom often came here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do it at home?
Check everyone.
Tell us about the ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session is now closed.
I've got a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm poor.
I can't wait until Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
It cuts cheese on thin pieces or on small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear the wearable clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, the sentence was a real move.
Give food to homeless people.
I translated the song the best I could.
He came out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I gave everything up.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write 10 pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where shall I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf audience.

I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's reddish.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA's poisoned to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around the door.
I'm very proud of it.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Thessaloniki.
Tom's at least honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, but it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossroads with it will happen sometime.
Tom has a good French government.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.

I'm just doing my duty.

She always wears dirty clothes.
Is that about to solve the thing?

We've already decided not to.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Who's Tom?
Tom worked older and older than the other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She laughed.
The gifts of Vishnua are called the Vishnuans; the gifts of Shiva are the Shivanites.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You grew up.
I've completely lost my mind.
I've never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roman?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in things people make I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I rejected Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This exceeds all the limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom is reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We don't have a choice.
When it's like this, it's best you sit home and don't go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
That's good enough.
I was definitely lucky.
Everyone kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis sword.
I called him.
How much does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you work.
I hope we visit Beijing too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together in half an hour.
I'm still a little tired.
Trying to maximize your own interest, happiness, or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything all right between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We've counted the years on the tree we've dug and discovered that it's 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want a fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I've upset him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom's still in shock.
Boston's a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one's been helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Would you like to cool down?

I could have gone, but I didn't want to.

She came by herself.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom's lost his sense.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me, I have a cell phone that just shows me the error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone laughed.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we should stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was kind of weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, change the grass and extract the nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Have fun!
Chances are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to drink you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Shall we go soon?
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank you for helping Tom.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The photographs of nature and animals, photographed in complete silence and calmness, are a real remek-work.
My mother died on the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in the 11th.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you a step.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm already on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a very bad day.
The whole state is messing with it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom's got the omelet ready.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm desperate.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a kid anymore.
I'm trying to check on the Futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on top of the shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had problems with solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do that.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom's still looking upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where's Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You work slow.
I didn't do that either.
The story of Snoria Sturlusson tells others that Christianity in Norway spread by violence.

Am I so different?
I fell apart.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant heart-colored chain is a necklace that will "break your world."
It all happened at a minute's speed.

It's raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.

We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
I'm great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary are always walking around holding hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another case.
Tom's still got some time.
The pain is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I'm just delaying.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I made an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be said.
Look what it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.

What did you say?
Tom could have been better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a lot of nothing.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs laughing.
Are they still there?
Tom didn't write Mary very long.
"Yes, you're from orange, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just stop you for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good idea.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to blame me.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.

You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Maria is the most comfortable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in these elections.

Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We've never been separated.
I've got 30.
Give me my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that moment, it exploded with a big crack.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that over 91 percent of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.

That's totally normal.
It's said that a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.

That's not what I'd like to do.
I'm really curious.
Tom's double-parked.
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.

I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.

He asked me to help him.
I'll be back later.

Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom's been working for about nine hours.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
Do it.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French times every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.

I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that makes the audience public.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.

Thank you so much!
Keep the couscor.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even children know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the border.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I'd like that to come to my mind.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
Can you smile at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate a potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.

She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
He's in the grave with one leg.
Tom just told me the other way.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That'd be a pleasure.
He's crazy like a power.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different from what it used to be.
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty good problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in a walk.
This one's really cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks flat, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.

Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this correct?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a minute.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of fighting.
What was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom could get away with it.
I just want to get away.
Don't let him get away with you like this.
Be careful.
It's in the first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you smile at Tom?
My fluent knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for my expressions, often conflicting, emotion.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the police.
I often feel a heart attack.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I've bowed once.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm sloppy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get there in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we stop that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
What kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for a quick ride?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the Internet.
She tried.

The results were amazing.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are jammed.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loud.
Don't move!
He recorded an accident.
Did I drop it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom wouldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
It's pointless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.

I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals have often been more violent in childhood.
You owe me a lot.

Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's the truth.
You're very unquestioned.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now's a great time to buy that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's out of it.
Tom got involved with people he never should've gotten involved with.
Tom is visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I've been overextinguishing.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I don't know what's going on.
They'll keep talking tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as much as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be known.
He's got plenty of money, even higher.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French being taught in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't give up.
I was used to not like anybody.
The brakes are screwing up.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's quoting a song he wrote when he was thirteen years old.
Did you see Tom's gone?
Be careful.
How would you like to do that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
He's got a lot of surprises.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and see.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your children have their rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in a dream.
A female chiffoner isn't completely out of a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about the cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing you can do except to admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?

I get my regular pay to keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any one of you would be so crazy to write his honest opinion, would find himself out on the street, in search of another job. If I allowed my right opinion to appear only in one issue of the newspaper for which I work, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours.

Did you see Tom's room?

That's a lot of talking about you.
Tell Tom to try harder.
Tom won't let us do that.
Life has become very hard.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that.
Maybe Tom's not hungry.
I always think about it.
I never should have listened to you.
Tom wanted to be okay.
I have to get used to it first.
Please repeat?
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?

The ring is tight.
All we know is Tom's fault.
I'll talk to Tom about it.

So we've set up a small portable cabin that can be divided into two parts and can be driven anywhere.

Let's meet!
It's a waste of time to be ugly.
That can't be true.
Please don't say that.
I already knew the truth.

I'd like to know what's going on here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
It wasn't a bad time for me to leave.
Tom hired a private detective to follow Mary.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.

I think I'll be back in about 30 minutes.

Who broke the school?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
I'm really proud of it.
Stop worrying so much.
I didn't care.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom a lot.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't own it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like a dad.
Come here early so we can talk about the plans.
Tom, do you like dogs or cats more?
He looks young for his years.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to deceive?
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
A new snowflake took place on the road to Etceskaret in Oda municipality in Hordalland on Tuesday night, and it is not known whether anyone is trapped in the bay.
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix my car on my own.
You know!
Please, hurry up.
Tom leaned his head.
Should we tell someone?
He was sinking from the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
His memory loss is more psychological than a physical problem.
He's out.
He started messing around.
Tom could've been better.
Tom got tired.
Pauk took your car.
So what if that's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't get out of here.
That meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Aren't you finished yet?
I'm gonna have to think about that question,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary agree.
When can Tom come home?
In the window window I see the reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could've spared my debts just because you told me I wasn't supposed to be here today.
This will make it much easier for us.
It wasn't too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board on the toilet.
Shall we see Tom again?
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He's been working for ten hours.
This one's pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Tom's probably still gonna be mad.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I don't fall for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
He accepted that it was a monster.
Do you know how to cook?
Shall we start soon?
You can't get into that room.
You know I don't like eggs.
Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Maria read the full instructions for working from 321 sides in the spirit.
How old is this plane?
I just got here.
What's wrong with you?
How old are you?
Did that work out for me?
I should be forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?
It's getting dark.
Don't get Tom on his way.

He has a lot of experience and his expertise has broken down into several areas.
Well, that's enough!
I bought a lot of things.
I'm upset.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
Why are we in this mess?
Tom's self-confidence was broken when the boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most people are afraid to set a great goal for themselves because of the fear that they will never reach it.
I'm desperate.

This building is blue.
I could eat a horse.
It's a really nice day outside.
This must be important.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
It's third city, by size, in Serbia.
What year was your car made?
Sit still.
He's a tall boy.
I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where did they go?
Does Tom know about this?
What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't keep up with it in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Learn hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try to add a new sentence here.
Things might turn out better if you didn't go there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to visit you yesterday.
Tom has a bad day.
Don't answer that.
Did she plant a red rose?
I'd like to go.
Stop trying to make me wrong.
Pride tends to become a charm, which is near the birth of madness.
How long is Tom going to last?
The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I'd like to know I'm painting like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We're limiting the luggage to 10 kilograms per piece.
We're never going back there.
It's been years.
They set up the Air Force Joint Command, where they were the head of the staff, respectively, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his shoes and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try it.
This is a mess.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think it's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
It's so bright.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Because of the lie he fell into trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his years.
I really like members of my team.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in a better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what to do.
Tom's on his way.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really so happy?
He's overheated the insurer.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows he's home very quickly.
She writes to her son sometimes.
Don't talk.
It happened right here.
I'm not too upset anymore.
Tom's worried he's gonna lose.
I think it's best to be kind.
Africa is a cage of humanity.
Tom has high moral standards.
My favorite lecturer was Jackson.

This one's pretty cool.
We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.
I think Tom likes baseball.
What are your ambitions?
I'm compassionate.
Tom used to be scared of me.
I was surprised by Tom's answer.
Are you speaking Greek?
Am I a suspect?

Better a kiss in the woods than ten in your hand.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
You have to speak louder.

We have to do it.
I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing uculelles.
Before this decision goes into effect, no one's going to move their fingers to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I got used to doing it.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom at work?
That's what a doctor needs.
I want to be a man one day again.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I gonna do here?
Tom wears black often.
Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
The danger lies behind every corner.
Are you sure this is safe?
No one agrees with you.
Tom's selling cars.

My father gave me a lot of money.
I'm not used to it.
I'm glad you answered.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I have an idea.
Tom bought a hulahop.
They'll know what to do.
You're definitely crazy.
Are we ready to go?
I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.
My mother has inherited the flowers in the garden.
Tom's not confused.
I think he's pretty arrogant.

Her dissertation must be written in English.
I have to go now.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
After she got into the lottery, she went out to the shop party.
I'm getting harder to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait till I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The satellite is a military satellite capable of overseeing many activities on earth, listening to communication lines, recording the working frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Maria are playing chess with a bunch of hand-picked chess figures reportedly from elephants.
If a command already exists, the system that you can receive and send email will work.
Go talk to Tom.

Did your girl like flowers?
I'm a little new in this.
This should work.

We've got enough here.
We drove him out of the country.
Tom left his key on the table, as he often did.
I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking it out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Why would you tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I like what you wrote.
Don't be bluffing.
Where did you find this knife?
You need to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope that Tom's predictions will be realized.
If we got here earlier, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
It's gold in green forests.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom was sitting very quiet.

So you want to learn another language.
What day is tomorrow?
Tom postponed his drink.
Maybe he'll come to see us tonight.
The air conditioner's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I didn't think you'd want that.
Would you like some more potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project of course required a budget rebalancing.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do it either.
The guard's in front.
I'll be in my fourth.
We'll go over everything again.
I wasn't worried about that.
It's fun.
Girls like to play the house.
I wish I hadn't done that.
The train arrived in time today, as always.
Do you want to talk to Tom instead of me?
Norway is my new home.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone already told Tom about this?
Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not a real man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this stuff?
Tom could convince Mary to do it.
Was I really so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What were you doing today?
How long am I gonna take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't eat just one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm going to leave early today.
What an adventure!
Tell me what it is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's home?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't shout.
Why are you acting childish?
We could have saved Tom only if we arrived a minute earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I need to buy a new coat because my old suit went out.

I'd like to introduce you to Tom.
There is little doubt that cutting in the already-populated system will have dramatic consequences for industry and communities in rural areas.
You were offended about it, even though it didn't even matter, and it was supposed to be something funny on my part, but you didn't see it that way.
Who's got time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a D.A.
My stomach hurts.
We calculated that we could get to that place within two weeks.
I've put all the tests.
Mary works as a waiter in a nearby cafe.
Let me explain.
I forgot the baby surveillance device.
She was reacting to it.
I'm naked.
What do you got there?
So, what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
I want you a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing a flanella pajamas.
I'm scared of dying.
There was only one small problem.
I'm all alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't convinced at all.
Don't ever say it.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airport.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom wore a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems dissatisfaction.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overexerting.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to go.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at 7:00 in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us overcome this.
I'm already paid.
They're all gone.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the spray, indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my quarter.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm upset.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department made fun of her clothes.
They're either gone or they're going through it.
I'll throw myself at it right away.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the hiking trails in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these words into Chinese?
Have you seen?
Are you busy here?
I'm the only one between two possibilities.
We got what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 7:00.
We didn't do that.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, give me those.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write?
He walked the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas book sale, and it's hard for a book to get out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a gala?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I knew.
You're changing.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well-prepared ahead.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
The girls were wearing weed jackets and they had flowers around the door.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure the table for cross-sectional budgets, insert and use normal tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me any time, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's next?
Doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was refined.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Can you prove it?
A little bit.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me playing?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been awful.
I'll lend you a work bond if you promise me you won't write anything about it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find it?
Are they in love?
Where to meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
It's a Latin language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
She's a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I've checked some things.
I'm not singing.
I'd love to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The Working Group on Data Transfer, led by Ben Manija, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say that if you hit the raindrop, it'll start raining.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to blame me.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom knows he's home very quickly.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more jealous than I look.
Nobody's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his lover.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I'm telling you.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom tipped it off.
I didn't step out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you tell me your name?
Look at this.
She saved her head alive.
I think we should call the doctor.
You're in a terrible hurry today.
We caught Tom at work.
We should be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They keep me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary earns for life by sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We came for you.
I'm trained.
What do you want?
Medicines should not be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, snow fell.
Some people no matter how long they're at, don't lose their beauty.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis sword.
That's pretty amazing.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Soviet scientist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?
We fought hard.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope loses when you experience a difficult situation and a pointless hug, you have to be strong.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve the problems of Egypt.
Solar energy is clean from energy.
I thought Tom didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's so easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He's losing his cell phone all the time.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot about it.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as much as his weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't shout.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
That's what I think.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with a cross-sectioned stick for wind stability and snow noodles, and this must be a double tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello to him.
I can't be anything I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said is a lie?
Tom didn't do that.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom and Merina's wedding?
This candidate is much better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's investigating the patient.
Tom put his drink on.
This is more of a cowardly thing than justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't bluff.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in their house.
Let's hope you're right.
We grew up on the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I burned my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that turn out to be me?
Did you sleep?
They've been hard on court.
Is there a reason you keep this old bottle?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That cloth isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.
Tom's been sitting on the bench all day, writing postcards.
Don't you want to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I just didn't go looking for you.
He's leading a rough life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.
Anatomical breast implants, however, can also lead to deformation of the chest if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little fuzzy.
I saw the bus.
Tom's wise enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to you to look at them in more detail.
I'm not both rich as much as we would like.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Regrettably, he has come to the point of becoming an invincible, dirty, small, and insignificant man of a small province in a vast empire from Almighty God.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow afternoon it'll rain.
Tom's a gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
Which planet are you with?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first test?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we've agreed.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the most beautiful in man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is up front.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom loves it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
I finished learning hope on Duoling yesterday.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom, they're listening because he's convincing.
My suitcase's not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in trouble, waiting at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know anyone who passed the last year's exam?
Mary took off for a trip.
They live on a high leg.
Tom came out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't support me very much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's all, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to sin, it's divine to forgive.
I did all the tests.
I just needed a little time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
Man dreams, God decides.
Tom was wearing black farmers.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place occupied?
That's right.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the basket.
All parking places are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
You use the device until it warns you to fill the battery and then fill it in for 5 hours to reach maximum capacity.
Tom's still pregnant.
You're becoming unwarranted.
No, don't do that.
I had a house when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I don't want to ask Tom to do that.
They all stood.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you talk to Tom?
Can you give me a remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your children usually eat?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Testing a new engine will take place today.
Come sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never saved that before.
I don't want to do that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom seems a little boring.
I loved it so my wife knows she's cooking.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We're gonna throw ourselves at it right now.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The insurer's overheated.
Are we safe now?
Tom says one day he'll do it.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.
She's wearing a gold chain around the door.
Electronics provides multi-step and simple adaptation of airflows.
Have you heard he finally came home?
During the weather, we see Mount Fuji in a distance.
That's your choice.

It's a multi-phase process.
I think you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.

It's not working on me.
The congregation is dissolved.
Tell me what you wrote.

That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He's kicking the ball in the face!
It's a big day today, son!
We were filled with joyful anticipation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'm sorry, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Delete your lips with the greeting.
Free libraries Haskel and Opera House are built on the border between Canada and the United States.

Do you know anyone there who's talking to Urda?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.

Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could have explained that.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.

I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?

The keys are in the chiffoner.
That's all we can do.
Are you wearing these new shoes?
What name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where the hell have you been so far?
She laughed.
Tom just couldn't do that.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.

The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.

Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.

Are you honest?
We'll try your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!

He's making a crimson that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.

Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I'm unconcerned.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm trying to make someone do it for me.
You're still unconscious.
We're gonna have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom was wearing black shirts and white shirts.
The book was worth five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived the accident.
No one I know is going out there anymore because it's a big mess.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
Drive slowly.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cats, please don't give up.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom's smile?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Follow my sugar, please.
I'm surprised.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
That's amazing!
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did it.
What did you do now?
Answer me right now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we have to do it at home.
It would be nice if you'd wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We're here in time.

It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?

Tom promises the Scotch mountains and valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming.
That's not connected.
Tom used to be scared of the dog.
Finally, we have all the names of the fields in Norway, and it will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left.
Where's the toilet?
It doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our work much easier.
Tom got involved with people who had a very bad influence on him.

Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend you visit the British War Museum in London.
The day he was born, he got a cat figure for luck from a work colleague.

Thank you!
I can't just give up.
Do you like it or not?
Life goes on!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.
Can we just start over?

Looks like he lives in Britain.
The storm is an example of an idephone.
You pay me well.
Tom said all right.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but he couldn't make it through it for the first 12 months.
Tom's right this time.
You're losing.
A lot has happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm giving up.
What's on your mind?
I gave them a present for the anniversary.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really so happy?
Do I have a reason?
That's how I figured it out.
Tom wrote a few hundred articles and a few books.
Come on.
What do you mean?
Tom wrote Mary's phone number.
It's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can walk all the time for only about three miles.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a junkie.
Beer's good.
I wish you'd never done this like this again.

Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.
I'll teach you to write.
Milage depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?
The sun was shining, but it was still cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.

He asked me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
I'm writing terrible.
Tom used to be a footballer.
I owe you an apology.
I pissed him off.
Tom's gonna go.

I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
I'll take the prying for my lunch.
I'm very proud of it.
What did you tell Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three advanced modes defined to achieve optimal results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't go out now, it's almost eleven hours.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
These projects never end.
I prefer orange apples.

Could it be true?
Don't let it get stuck in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What's your anniversary car?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those of you who may have been offended; that was not my intention.

Nothing can stop me.
Crimeans should be punished.
Who knows what it was?
It's been a long time.

I don't like writing.
You ask me questions that you already know the answers to.
I didn't see anything.
A few men get angry at Tom at the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom failed to produce any evidence that would support his statement.
I'm not so happy.

If something sounds too good to be true, it probably does.
I won't say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I call a cab?
Tom signed Mary as a payer waiting.
Open up.
Tom's very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't either.
Do you like roller bones?
It'll be all right at the end, if it's not okay, then it's not even the end.
Move, people.
Are you sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't be making fun of others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I shut down the keys?
There's a clear difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Look at your business!

Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.

What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate himself a whole box of chocolate.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be said.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think that's very smart.
Does that mean you love me?
This is never gonna end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere to talk?
Explain it in simple words.

Who else is using this room?
You'll save time if you listen to my instructions carefully.
He's tired of reading.
Could we order now?
We can't stand here.
Tom didn't even think for a moment to try to convince Mary to do it.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I don't completely agree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
There's nothing going on with me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing well.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the table, but I couldn't read because it was not enough.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a false warning.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get the waxes.
Tom didn't let me answer Mer's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed startled.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help if you worry.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Have you gone to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go with the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Are you blaming me?
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom's still got some time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything solved now?
Please send me a doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mer's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I was improvising.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We're helping each other.
Tom and Mary are still good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom's smacked the smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's coming.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
Turns out I'm right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Don't come near my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I even tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed a little time.
I didn't think you'd do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off.
Both up and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm firmly against this.
You underestimate me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
The police didn't reject the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She was thinking of becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work has been paid off.

I was just thinking about you.
The signal lamps are used to transmit the sea blue.
It's not going any further than Main Street, but from there you can catch number 31.

I'm trying as hard as I can here.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
The government has fallen.
Tom poured a bottle of wine.
This will last forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed his goal.
I totally disagree with you.
We're out of here.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
There was a lot different than the intended effect.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book's been distributed.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That's what needs to be true.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hating.
I don't doubt he'll make it.
I've never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother's father enjoys the tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They've been lying to everyone.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it as a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must demonstrate their legitimacy, registration papers and license at the time of the inspection.

It's over there.
I pretended I don't know what's going on.
Just stay with me.

Does Tom have a key?
Tom's ready.
You always do.
There are situations in chess where it is paid to sacrifice a figure to gain advantage for a long time.
Young children should learn to feel comfortable with animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
That's hard to imagine.
Are you sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom postponed his drink.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Spice's empty.
Tom's decided to "against."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer that.
If you would do that for me, it would help a lot.
He was bare chest and bony.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried now.
What's in there, Tom?
Do your best.
I'm totally out of money.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a while?
Don't let him get in your head.
She touched my right hand.
Well, that's enough!
I'm selling coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water and didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'm happy to agree.
Every bird in its flock is flying.
Do you want to see the total eclipse of the sun that will leave Svalbard in the dark on 20 March 2015?

I know it's illegal.
I learned hard when I was at school.
They wanted to punish me.

I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They're different like heaven and earth.
Tom was completely alone.
The horse's here.
Everybody's asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents anything.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, that big and multi-national, in the large region of Tver, by size equal to a few English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to type in a typewriter, and he told his teacher not to learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I played well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this in mind for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was clearly depressed.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We fell in love last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.
Something's happened.
Help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this move.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what he's bringing tomorrow.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm surprised.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan, don't worry.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us to camp next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Drive carefully.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
Cheers!
Tom's in the pajamas.
Did Tom believe you in the story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was wrong.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give everything we can't do that.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody's standing.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
You can never make shit so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my ears red?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair payments, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
It's encouraging news.
Give me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do that alone?
Is everything settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, is so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a real person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had lunch at speed.
That was a risk.
His wife took his shirt off.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in the sauce from the oven for tonight.
I'm always ugly.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just happened.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've grown old.
They're not mine.
I'm double-priced.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published over the Internet.
Tom got drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we take a break for a while?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I keep saying that.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I'm on my way.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom's dropped a bit of a smoldering breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak fast.
It's about to be half three.
They'll know.
Tom bought some black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Chiri is considered one of the major financial centers.
That one's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I just don't hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get undressed.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passable, but beautiful memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We fought hard.
It was a drop that swallowed the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we went down Park Street.
The cop arrested him for driving in a drunk state.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope he likes people.
We all have a price.
That's what gave the idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Teheran?
Run over any obstacles with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone sending messages and e-mails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Lucky was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay children for the rest of their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I need to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
As fast as it is, it's a bit.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I couldn't hide my bitterness for her insanity.
Butter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
I've passed the test!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't fuck up.
Does he still have a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
