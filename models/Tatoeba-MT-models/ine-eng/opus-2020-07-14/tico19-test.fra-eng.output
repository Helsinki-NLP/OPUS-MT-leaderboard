Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 in need of care, in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a home of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Disease Prevention and Control Centre designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the infection in SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized in coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80 per cent of those affected by COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while 6% of remaining cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the combined incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (S.R.-U.), and compare it with the evolution of the province of Hubei, China.
We will also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiterie et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe following the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people coming from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (USA) with 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Total number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities from different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 0800.
This data was used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase in around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the aggregate number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
At 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purposes of COVID-19, including for withdrawal tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not provided).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds for 100000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios on the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk & gt; 90% excess capacity in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of CEPCM risk assessment for COVID-19.
As the cases have so far been grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and as hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare themselves for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, through an anchoring approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a few patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of cases of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mice and caused similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a severity and mortality lower than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people than young men and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide an appropriate and comprehensive review of this subject of full research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will be more involved in understanding and eradicating this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, marked the Chinese, who were forced to remain closed for the entire golden week as well as for other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SRAS) in 2003; that is why SARS-CoV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before it spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review seeks to synthesis the progress of research on this new subject in full.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take note of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and forecasting, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of the common rhume 4.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemic of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1 of the then unknown home of pneumonia, Wuhan was first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spreading to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan marine fruit market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
To the extent that the situation changes rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study conducted in 8 866 patients, of which 4,021 confirmed COVID-19, presented an updated overall view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bddA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more frequently in the 30-65-year-old section.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the periphery.
The mean time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean time between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large-scale viruses that contain a simple brown RNA.
They can be classified into four kinds, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the Man belonging to alpha and beta.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is associated with angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidease-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms the vesiculars containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples taken on the site of the epidemic origin, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of the electronic microscope in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a smaller infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secret protein coded by the orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNv; however, the Orf8 does not contain known functional areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of a diamond and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug cribling in order to eliminate infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Original and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV came from mice and that they were transmitted to Man through the civets and camels, respectively.
As a result of a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the mice were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two types of SARS-type coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect the Human remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., have released the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from the mice to the human through the snakes, which would involve a homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangoline - a long museum mammals feeding on furmis, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by genetic homology at 99% between a coronavirus discovered in the pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 per cent gap between two genomics is a difference of importance; it is therefore necessary to expect conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
The SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively infect the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported with regard to the immune response to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the immune system ingested by molecular grounds (PRR) receptors, including type C lecine receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of I-type interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
T-aid cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious injuries to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, or death.
Sars-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more than 3 to 7 days after a study in the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted in 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a sample ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after as precise an incubation period as possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic individuals from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, swelling, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat, rhinorrhoea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients presented dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
With regard to serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies conducted on a family and on a home that emerged following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilation assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which was consistent with a higher lethality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gorilla disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
With regard to SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and that ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 worldwide confirmed cases.
Comparably, the mortality rate of SARS in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8 096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) at 95% from 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV reached only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-COV-2, MERS-COV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often takes place within a family or within a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals may be carriers of the virus without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that re-established patients may again be carriers of the virus, which highlights the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (notably lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and high blood hemoglobin, and most had a rise in C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Thoracic radiography abnormalities are found in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or a depleted glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II tyres results in a decrease in the surface area and an increase in the surface tension, thereby reducing the lung capacity to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapses.
Consequently, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a breakdown of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multi-nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with viral infection and SDRA pathology and appears to patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 DNA through a chain-reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical backgrounds, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SHERLOCK technology-based technology protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic DNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) by means of a reactive tape in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens would be conclusive.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients who are restored, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lungs at a early stage and is likely to be less likely to other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure constitute the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat heart failure or critical respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive reaction of the immune system has been found to cause cytokine shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokines, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokine, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids have not had any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious secondary effects, including abascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of short-dose low-moderate corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Thereafter, redesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-bred RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead sent the composite to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly expected.
In addition, baracitinib, interferon-α, combination lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver lesions and other undesirable effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of restored patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients with a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies to pathogens.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralise them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who have been cured of COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in association with a decrease in the inflammation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated abnormalities should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and lead to a potentially fatal cytokines release syndrome.
Blood levels of antibodies are generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells of restored patients and to identify genetic codes with the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
The MTC has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of the MTC.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
At present, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of COVID-19 healing were observed in the provinces of China that had used the MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and the Hunan province (50 per cent), while the Hubei province, which had used only 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest rate of healing (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It has appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be specified through more-scale and more-scale controlled tests.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute and even suicidal tendencies.
The compulsory search for contacts and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for the sick with regard to the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other individual in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional applications and electronic equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animal tanks and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models of fatal prophylaxis and protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SARS extended 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to report in the Middle East and in other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for the MIS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the considerable time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in the coronavirus.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the disease recovers gradually without sequencing.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies carried out so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for the SRAS forecast, and that also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 according to a study conducted in 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean age 66 to 51 years), thus suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 vs 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer acute cardiac and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive CCE2 cholangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the forecast of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (CK) may also be involved in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including heart and liver levels, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
They are traditionally heart or liver dysfunction markers.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with the other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used to treat infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the high dose of corticosteroids has been widely used for severe cases of SARS, many survivors presented an avocado osteonecrosis resulting in permanent inability and quality of medical life.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and to a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional cases of stress, patients who often experience long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of the SRAS.
In addition to being reflected in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively reflected in higher respiratory pathways and does not or does not experience any symptoms in the first phase of the infection, as do coronaviruses from the origin of common roms.
As a result, newly infected individuals or incubated individuals may produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low transmission probability in the first phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than that of the SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the confination of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of the almost totality of the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which seems to be much more infectious than the SARS, will not extend in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have been operational.
According to the initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to lead to up to one million cases and one and a half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection to eventually spread or evolve into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by the toes or exterminations, as well as possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in cells, thus opening a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Caution should therefore be taken in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, close friends and colleagues, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected gouts or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of 10 to 80 nm screws, with only 5% of fully penetrated screws; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles can cross five surgical masks stacked together on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted insulation blisters to further reduce contact with viruses.
The viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On 22 January 2020, a physician found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus could have penetrated his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also carry transparent views or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For the populations of affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have placed China as a high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention would reassure the population that the new virus was low, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a significant relief, particularly at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was lacking.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn lessons and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, since each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) increase sensitivity and reactivity in relation to the unusual data of clinics rather than waiting for formal reports of doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than attempting to reassure the population; and (4) increase targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the system of response to society.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of the SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as a pre-view impression.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality are also more important in older people.
The SRAS has a mortality rate higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while the SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients who were seriously ill; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular DNA detection tests of SARS-CoV-2 may prove negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may again be positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain pending, including:
Where's Sars-CoV-2 coming from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronavirus types of SARS from mice, it is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. mice, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly in the respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also connect to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve on a genetic basis during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like the SARS or regularly refurbish the surface like the flu?
It is essential, even if this may take some time, to find answers to all of these and to many others.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients had severe respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
Without the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress such as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high kinase creatinine are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspicion of SARS.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Some 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which may be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, considerable efforts have been made to research on HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the birth of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is in reality present throughout the world.
The HCOV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called crop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized man due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
As with HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and continuously to humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the SRAS are similar to those of the SRAS and are characterized by a evolutionary acute pneumonia.
Unlike the SRAS, many patients suffering from SMR have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of SMR compared to HCOV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high rate of death, or 34.4 per cent, which makes the MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogen, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCVs (the HCOV-229E, the HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 and the HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-COV-2 can be detected in cell samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its long-term dissemination after transmission to humans, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCV causes moderate symptoms have been well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCOV pandemics.
In order for this to happen, HCOVs should be placed in a sufficient proportion in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host restriction factors.
In this perspective, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more infected people are important, the more chances are that the virus fits completely to man.
If it fits well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by forty or other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four coVs in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple rhume among the relevant subjects.
These viruses do not need to be kept alive.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogens, have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to achieve potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and to four HCVs acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogen than HCV acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will completely adapt to human beings and will circulate among the last without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origins of the HCOV, it will be useful to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural, reservoirs, intermediate and amplified HCOV hosts.
An animal serves as a evolutionary host of an HCOV if it opens a nearby ascendant sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogen for its host.
Similarly, a reservation guest opens the HCOV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
In particular, since 80 % of Guangzhou's market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also be used as mid-term amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These mice are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that mice are the host of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is known as the recipient of SARS-CoV.
Despite a high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and the mice are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
That's why shears can't be the host intermediate container of the MERS-CoV.
In addition to studies carried out in the Middle East, it has been shown that the seropositive seropositive seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the camels originating in the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels expel the virus not only by respiratory pathways but also by fecal pathways, which is also the main route of excrement of mice.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangoline is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-COVs associated with SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 from pangoline.
Recombination is a common factor in the development of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be derived from the HCOV-Syre CoV, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another coV of hot-water, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while Camelides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infected humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the nearby HCOV-229E cable was found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with mice in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of HCOV-229E-related mice are numerous and non-pathogenic in mice, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, mice are the direct source of human pathogen virus, including the virus of the rabies, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that mice can transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the mouse can be used as a genetic reserve of the HCOV-229E, alpagas and travelers could be used as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-COV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of sewerheads to travellers and travelers to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in the mice is known due to its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in the travelers for decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have passed from mid-guest to stable natural reserve.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolines.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, mice may be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with the mice through the decommissioning or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amps to which a SRAS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus by decomposing and consuming meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place in a third species that has been both in contact with mice and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-bred RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of the CoV could be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per site, according to the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new guests.
However, the rate of change in the CoVs is about one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when the CoVs do not fit well in the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-COV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to man.
It can be assumed that it has already been adapted to another guest near the people.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which has been well adapted to drivers.
In theory, the genetic derivative is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs randomly and frequently change model when replication of the NRA through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals, such as SL-COV and batCOV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutions can be key factors for human adaptation of the virus.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 unit means that the affinity of this protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, a study by electronic chryomiscopy indicates a affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Incidentally, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E, and silic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCOV-OC43.
The differentiation of host proteins between humans and natural HCOV reserves, such as mice, ruminants and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HPV emergency: return to the starting box
The diversity of the COVs of hot-keys offers many new HCOV emergency opportunities.
In this sense, the COVs are genetic reserves of the HCOV.
Among the SARS-CoV-accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since the SARS-CoV-related sluice viruses were isolated, but different ORF8 proteins were coded.
This removal breaks the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is present as an adaptive change that promotes the change of host.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred among travellers in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCOV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-COV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading framework detachment.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when the mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and the mice.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice may both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "recollection" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when they are introduced into a new host.
CoV strains could also evolve more pathogens by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to book such as mice and camels.
They are firmly responsibly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was separated from the CoV replication.
The same immune response separation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory mass NLRP3 is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with the MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-coV of cauliflowers sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a coV of cauliflowers sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoV of the pangoline significantly similar to the SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangoline beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have been returned under ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the travel agent for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other control measures of the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of Chauve-Syres, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a chance of contamination.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
First, if the mice transmit a parental virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances under which the mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Whether it's a mousehead, a pangoline or another mammals, we should be able to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhume, for example, by avoiding washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home shelters.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who are nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor delicacy effect, the frequent washing of hands can soften the skin by causing cutaneous drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to ekekema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dehydration, and especially frequent among health workers.
The too common washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
The dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective cleansing agent for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants will target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the latter may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active agent and skin protection, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as the antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, wet and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with salads and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of soft water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a product of non-aqueous hand hygiene.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizing agent such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mussel for greater ease of use and reduce the acidic effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly move or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in cutaneous desiccation if the formula is not reinforced by skin emollients and/or moisturizing agents.
The acidic effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is slowed after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
The ashes or the earth can be more effective than the water alone, but less than the soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Move your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to differ).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frying action created by the friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and frying longer removes more germs.
Drink plenty of running water.
Inflammation in a staging water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean serving or in the open air.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, the space between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial nails and the scalable nail paint can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, to flush out water from a suspended and lost well or to use ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tipy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in toilets.
After the washing and drying of the hands in hot-water dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the thighs.
Drying in the air-tight air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the body of the fingers of 42% and on the shoulders of 15%.
After the hands were dried, the following variations in the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to the drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant tabs is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands shake and fry.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The objective of washing hands in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms (the germs) and to avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/bioliquids;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms up to the neck, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When washing, it must be avoided that water on the front arms does not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the rate of handwashing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hands washing rates may also be due to tight habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emotion illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing in soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to the blinds in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "to wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
Moreover, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand that their hands be washed before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genes, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted on the selection, particularly by the host immune system.
For example, the total loss of the ORF4 can be cited in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCOV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-COV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading framework detachment.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when the mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and the mice.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice is eliminated by positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice may both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "recollection" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when they are introduced into a new host.
CoV strains could also evolve more pathogens by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to book such as mice and camels.
They are firmly responsibly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was separated from the CoV replication.
The same immune response separation strategy could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory mass NLRP3 is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with the MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared on the basis of the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-coV of cauliflowers sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a coV of cauliflowers sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present in the markets have been discovered as carriers of the same virus in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Beta-CoV of the pangoline significantly similar to the SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangoline beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have been returned under ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in mice and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCOVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the key and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
As the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civets present in the markets, the closure of the markets for fresh products and the slaughter of the civets found there could have been an effective end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the markets of fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be identified in the studies to be followed.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been in the travel agent for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other control measures of the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of Chauve-Syres, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no lack of opportunity for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recombinate, causing the emergence of new coVs more transmissible and/or mortal in the future in humans.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the damage caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a chance of contamination.
Although mice have many positive features for the spread of viruses, the probability for humans to be in contact with mice and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to keep away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if the mice transmit a parental virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the circumstances under which the mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's a mousehead, a pangoline or another mammals, we should be able to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will allow the development of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we responded to a comment on our directives and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a "suspect" case and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially carries the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named acute acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She's been paying a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, COVID-19's diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have seen seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially amended.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a proposal for a simple assessment based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must be associated with one of the characteristics of the epidemiological backgrounds with two elements of clinical manifestations to complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological background: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-COV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or near areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed disease disease disease virus and/disease in the home environment.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) image showing the characteristics of an infection in the COVID-19; (3) total number of white blood cells indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) PCR test in real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral gene with strong homogeneity with new known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 by negative or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acids in respiratory tract or blood extracts was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nuclear acid detection kit for a rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory path samples including blood collection, with increased availability of various specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, increasing evidence reminds us of caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s graphic representation should be updated as they classified people who did not have clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest directives in their countries.
Our team will also update our directive on time to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in a single day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of persons infected included 114 active cases and 33 prisoners, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On 19 March, these three people were already restored.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the million in the world, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the city's settlement until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the extension of the national emergency state of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics have reversed the tendency to reveal the extent to which HCOV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most HCVs come from mice in which they are not pathogens.
The host intermediate reserves of some HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-host interactions in animals could also improve the understanding of the CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified as four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that mice and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-COV and beta-COV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-COV and delta-COV.
To date, seven human coVs (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-COVs include the HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and the SARS-COV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of the HCOV offers a framework for understanding natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors in the cross-border crossing of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagion.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
During the last few decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of classical rhume, including headaches, swelling, nausea and throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present all over the world and seem to be transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with temperature.
Stores in Australia reduce the limited amount of paper toilet per purchase
Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian Woolworths and Coles stores chain reduced their two-to-two-to-one purchase restrictions and a package per purchase in all national stores, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently collected reservations for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confiscate.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package per order.
These measures resulted in the previous restriction of four purchase packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release on 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are always in stock-breaking at the time of delivery", and qualified the request for "without precedent", while ALDI, in a publication on Facebook Tuesday, described it as "in anticipation".
Sales experienced a "high increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce more poverty, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI first made stock available for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to the demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early opening of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the field of the distribution of the University of Technology in Queensland, explained that stores reupply stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, leading to stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in the radius, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said on Wednesday they were breaking stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer sales to auctions were organized because the buyers were on leave during the weekend of the Labour Festival.
The issue of Thursday's NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page package designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report of 3 March Australia's ABC in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two 12 reels packages.
World Health Organization Qualified COVID-19 Pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of disease spread, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push Governments into action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in the framework of the response," said Theodores Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "without precedent".
He stated, in a speech published by CNN in February, that "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its appearance to its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyeus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never been witnesses of a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To make it short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126 000 COVID-19 cases in the world, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared urgent international public health on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people are cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may range between two and fourteen days.
There is no specific known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to touch, staying away from other people, and monitoring and limiting those suspected of being infected.
Global authorities have responded by introducing restrictions on movements, quarantines, cover sheets, risk controls on workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalised scarcity exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, reaching approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in atmospheric pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case house on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's large sea fruit market and therefore the virus is thought to be zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is the SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to the choronaviruses of mice, the pangoline coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no clear link with the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unaudited report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be raised on 17 November 2019, in a person of 55 years of age in the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19-year-olds and less than 2,4 per cent of the world's cases. The United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance believed that 60 per cent of the British population should be infected before they can achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested in COVID-19, whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to test only those who had a positive symptom, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that up to 23 January China estimated 86% of the undetected COVID-19 infections and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people affected by COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were reported in COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent experienced pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased people who have been tested positive for COVID in accordance with official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include the deceased untested - e.g. at home, in retreat homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the figures of surmorality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesman acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by the United States sub-assessment anecdotic reports. Such a sub-estimation occurs often in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-related report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimates for the case report decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the fatality rate (letality rates), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of contaminants (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) that result from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University believes that the infection rate for pandemic in its overall population is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this sample is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on the fatality rate estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Uncontrollablely, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease is lacking in available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment that this will happen.”
The leading Chinese medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be ended by June" if all countries were to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to encourage the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (may be 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is transmitted very easily—disappears completely" and that it could "be transformed into a seasonal disease which can be repatriated every year."
The virulence of this return depends on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and the infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosites), loss of smell, souffation, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) review emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulties, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult wakes, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then researchers have issued recommendations that persons who have had close contact with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessment of the asymptomatic ratio ranges from some 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and the onset of symptoms) ranges between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COPID-19 who lost their odor was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease continues to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly when a close contact is made and for purposes of drops produced by turning, spreading, or talking; this close contact is equivalent to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that towing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by air droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be designed by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be designed at the time of expiration, including by talking, although the virus is not usually airported.
Pistols can land in the mouth or nose of other persons located next to or even inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and respiration (RCP) may cause respiratory secretions that are powdered and therefore cause air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by the cells, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms occur and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for disease up to three days before symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not yet know exactly how the disease is spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
However, it depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, like having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people might have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
It's supposed to be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis has shown that coronavirus is genetically belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, to sub-genera Sarbecovirus (Lingage B) associated with two strains from the mice.
It is equivalent to 96% of the total genem of another sample of coronaviruses of mice (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid that is different in some parts of the gene sequences between the pangoline and human viruses.
The comparison of the overall genotype has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between the pangoline coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangoline is the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scans.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning it in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner is not used to depist or as a first-purpose test to diagnose the COVID-19".
WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first performance on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx extract but a gorilla extract can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved sufficiently reliable to be approved for generalised use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic image elements on the radiographics and tomodensitometry (scan) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case-imaging results.
Due to the recompensation with other infections such as adenovirus, the image without PCR confirmation is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if the image is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending that it be taken into account as a testing tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in the image on both radiographics and scanners.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or standing in a mosquito and throwing the mosquito directly into a garbage bag.
Those who would have already been contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have banned or decoupled all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who may be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of data to locate mobile phones by Governments in this regard raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respected private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, to shave the nose and chew with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when their hands are visible; before eating; and after washing, having coughed, or exhausted.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant containing at least 60 % of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute exposure to the disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62-71 %, isopropanol to 50-100 %, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5 %, and povidone to 0.2-7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment as an office building or a crèche, all such rooms as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folds or a mosquito when they touch or extend, and to throw away any mosquito immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the posters that are designed by speaking, extending, and twisting.
WHO issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene." The use of masks has also been recommended for those who deal with a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended the port of masks for healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a disease affected by COVID-19, even though it recognized that the port of mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other persons.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or connected places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited release in public without masks or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the port of mask to everyone in public places, to protect each other and protect each other.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the port of the mask to train and bus passengers on 1 April.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artificial mask to those who can't buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied while remaining at home, limiting their journeys, avoiding crowds, greeting themselves without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the United States government and health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and no later than 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. As a result, they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that there should be total social isolation rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation not to have sexual intercourse with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus or who does not have symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who thought to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation; many Governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a disease affected by COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to settle in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are narrowing or eliminating, and attenuation.
The eradication is implemented at the first stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate the infected, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination in order to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Equation and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an epidemic of infectious disease is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: it is called aggravation of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and makes time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distance such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; and environmental actions such as cleaning of the surfaces. More drastic measures to remedy the epidemic were taken in China as soon as the severity of the epidemic became apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and quarantine, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to the infected people who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and penalized the supply of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that the slowdown (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and the removal (the development of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand of 2/3 and death of half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because otherwise the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
The long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medications without order against rhyme or drinking and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
Use of steroids can exacerbate results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has stated that some "traditional and artificial drugs" can cure the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and the adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a key response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for the care of primary health care hospitals and services for the recovery of resources at different levels, including by concurring laboratory services to the COVID-19 tests, by canceling non-emergency interventions when possible, by separating and insulating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are several theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be recovered on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronary viruses in the Hubei has increased gradually.
They are generally linked to the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's hospital, which informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were recommended by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was recommended by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan's health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. At the first stages of the epidemic, the number of cases was double every seven days and half.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted their movements and introduced border controls.
National reactions included measures to resolve such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or shelter orders) and shelters. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, were submitted to a form of confiscation in the United States, more than 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, approximately 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world were familiar with a form of confiscation, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would return on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown case house on 26 December, which informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "professed rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to end the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop the journeys from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of New Chinese An (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built as follows: Leishenshan, in order to treat additional patients.
In addition to new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals.

After the epidemic entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in the event via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.

The schedules of air companies were also affected and thus modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population of the virus, and isolate all infected people and monitor and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The methods of screening included the mandatory individual signal of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, the virus screening drives issuing results the following day, and an increased test capacity to allow the test of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not put in forty whole cities. South Korean society was initially divided on the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the government's epidemic or to pay tribute to its response.

The United Kingdom's response to the virus was first seen as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distance or measure of forty mass to its citizens.
Therefore, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and vitality in response to the public's concerns.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a ban on movement in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that even though it was not "a recommendation of WHO," it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and spoke of a fact "without precedent in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an urgent public health emergency of international coverage (USPI), the sixth USPI since the measure was called the A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPI was due to "the risk of global spread, in particular for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of restrictions on movement, Tedros stated: "There is no reason for measures to interfere in vain with international trade and travel" and " WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".

This virus may be on the way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, which would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human being on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be qualified as pandemic.
The Director-General noted that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction."

Several provincial Chinese Communist Party (PCC) administrators have been identified from their functions as a result of their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of discontent regarding the response of policymakers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Chinese Communist Party's secretary-general Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high Chinese leaders, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would hold its origins from the United States or Italy.
The American administration of Donald Trump qualified the coronavirus of "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has now become a global pandemic", which was then taxed by some opponents and intended to "turn away the attention of his administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. government explaining the main lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "Everything comes from China.

The President of Iran Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country was ill at combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic prompted calls from the United States to adopt common social policies to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's election chances during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “emphatic and passive efforts” after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed two weeks in quarantine on government-designed sites.
The South Korean society was at the beginning divided on the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the government's epidemic or to pay tribute to its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt an emergency legislation in response.

This has also led to a shortage of individual protection equipment around the world and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for the Daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a child milk shortage in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the strong prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the strong demand for food products that followed, both areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against illegal stockpiling and trade in essential products have been a real success, avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its important agricultural production, Northern Italy has not found a significant decline, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government had delocked pig reserves to ensure adequate livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

The actions fell again because of the fears associated with the coronavirus, the most significant decline found on 16 March.
Many believe that economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in time by central banks and states.
Central banks react more quickly than they did during the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to the bans on movement, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments against all travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decline in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with New Chinese An.
A number of events involving important crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also closed their shops and their tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Moon Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gathering, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended New Year's holidays until 10 February, imposing on most of the workplaces not to be opened before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The distribution sector has been affected at the global level, with reduced opening hours for shops or temporary closures.
Business visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a drop of 33% to 43% of pedestrian traffic in malls in March compared to February.
Operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to control customer temperature and cancel events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs during the Wuhan epidemic.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves trapped in domestic or occupied provinces in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In India, confiscation left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) to unemployment. Angus Reid survey observed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had lived on a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their employment in Spain since the border imposed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies have made their employees go to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzlab.
The part-time German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, worldwide.
The arts and cultural sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, all over the world, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed up to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated consequences of the disease, the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry has also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place last week in the period of Christian imprisonment of the Karema, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend Sunday's Masses; some churches spread their religious services to radio, live, or television while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and its chapels and the place of Saint-Pierre, which was seen by all its Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also cancelled their services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gudwaras.
The Minister of Iranian Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Médine.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events have been cancelled or reported, including the UEFA Championships League 2019-20, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH 2019-20 season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the Summer Olympics in 2020, which was originally due to begin at the end of July; the Olympic International Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021". The casinos and other world-wide gaming facilities closed and live poker tournaments were postponed.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online games sites have found a significant increase in their number of new enrolments. The world of the show has also been touched, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in exchange for traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online " festivals" created for artists to take place, spread and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet sites on the topic of coronavirus have spread because many enjoy humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been seen against people of Chinese and Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hospitality have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific region.
Reports dated February (while most cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to sensitive new countries, Italians from the first European country to a serious epidemic of COVID-19 could also deal with suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have at first signed petitions to ban Chineses from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan has pissed off on Twitter.
The Chinese as well as the other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in the levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
US President Donald Trump has addressed the criticism of having qualified the coronavirus of "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the West Bengal Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which described them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were condemned by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign wastes" that should be "cleared".
Many access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have made available their scientific articles in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on advertising servers such as bioRxiv.

The detection in the laboratory of the respiratory disease at coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detection of the virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus DNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngitis or waiting sample.
Results are generally available within 2 hours.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngitis is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Then, the virus can disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a rat (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with a reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the authorisation of emergency use of the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time from the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three was obtained by non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test strip for the Atlanta CDC. Thus, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only until federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The US commercial laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and treatment of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorisation (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the m2000 system of Abbott. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepiheid also received an FDA U.S. for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isothermal amplifying technology of nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify the production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically relates to the nucleocapside protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid influenza test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary radiographics have a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] may be conclusive even before symptoms occur."
Among the typical signs visible on the TDM are multi-lobular polyspheric depoli, with peripheral, asymmetry and lateral distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its image results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for testing or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from around 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and within the framework of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by testing the patient's hair (point-of-care testing, PACT).
High-voltage automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to monitor immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 duly informed entities that can now distribute their antibody testing tests.
On 7 April 2020, one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.By March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the PCR test of the viral DNA.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits for antibodies purchased by the country was sufficient to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan where cases of suspicion may remain, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients cry inside, return it and receive the result of the test later.The British NHS has announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, thus eliminating the risk that a patient will not infect others by becoming in a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test drive for suspected cases, a health professional will take a sample taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by sickness insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, drive tests were available in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at 12/20 calendar week, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested until 12/20 and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technology and Rambam's hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the time, including samples and only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory for emergency detection of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 中, that is "4".
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities as a whole.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50 000 tests per day.Several-made free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, poverty and insufficient response rates became an obstacle to mass testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine the preparation protocols for samples that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes in order to continue testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct drive tests and purchase a high-speed laboratory at the population level with Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different target test formulas have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for the manufacture of low-income kits that do not have the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the Centres for Disease Control of the United States was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to respond to the demand and recommendations for testing of health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of testing programmes as a better way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for virus-wide testing has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests delayed in the United States private laboratories, and the reserves of shells and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "failures". The government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private tests.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to properly use kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would remove the wrong results kits and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by the forty of those who obtained a positive result and the tracking of the people who had been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death associated with COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of about 3,400 people, about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of the people with positive results did not have symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the community, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of retail restaurants and establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise residents to stay at their home on March 28, but schools have returned to the date scheduled for the end of their holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic by means of an aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinations, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have carried out the most tests compared to the number of deaths have much lower fatality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people than minor symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and 10 negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 reference laboratories of COVID-19 to carry out confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of Tests" column depends on national testing policy.
A country that does not test that persons admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other factors are the same.
The washing of hands, also called hands hygiene, corresponds to cleaning your hands to remove the salads, fats, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by oo-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhume, for example, by avoiding washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's cheeks or changing her thighs, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you do not have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
After changing the layers of a child or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after having been wet or have been sucked/extended;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
Hygiene in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or producing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home shelters.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote hand washing could reduce the diarrhoea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income regions in drinking water.
Washing hands in the soap allows for 48% reduction of diarrhoea episodes and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections (IRAs). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who are nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the deaths caused by diarrhoea and a quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects from impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor delicacy effect, the frequent washing of hands can soften the skin by causing cutaneous drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to ekekema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dehydration, and especially frequent among health workers.
The too common washing of hands is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (mice, defecation), after cleaning a baby's faucets (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after having taken care of a cut or wound, after having stretched out, touched or wet, after touching animal waste or manipulated animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the cleaning rate for soap is low.
According to a survey conducted in 2015 with 54 countries and with the hygiene of the hands, 38.7 per cent of households on average wash hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia the highest (97 per cent) rate, the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was showing the lowest rate (23%). Today there are several methods for changing behaviour and democratizing the use of soap to wash hands at key times of the day. It is particularly predictable in developing countries to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands at specific times of the day to make children habitable.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a Primary Health Care Program to promote the health and education of children.
The dispersal twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective cleansing agent for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are damaged with the mouse.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferred".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to those concerned with their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants will target organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which are resistant to many kinds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the latter may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the active agent and skin protection, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as the antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, wet and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with salads and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of soft water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a product of non-aqueous hand hygiene.
At the end of the 1990s and early in the twenty-first century, non-aqueous hand hygiene products (correspondingly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or disinfectants for hands) began to popularize.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizing agent such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mussel for greater ease of use and reduce the acidic effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as mushrooms.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4-5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly move or cover both hands.
The thumb and back of both hands, as well as the interstices between fingers and nails for approximately 30 seconds, should be faced until liquid, mouse or ice is dry.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are clearly salty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in cutaneous desiccation if the formula is not reinforced by skin emollients and/or moisturizing agents.
The acidic effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The lower tendency of hydroalcoholic solutions to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and the formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is slowed after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who instead use ash or earth.
The ashes or the earth can be more effective than the water alone, but less than the soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Move your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to differ).
Move a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frying action created by the friction, which helps to eliminate germs from the skin, and frying longer removes more germs.
Drink plenty of running water.
Inflammation in a staging water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean serving or in the open air.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, the wrist, the space between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial nails and the scalable nail paint can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, to flush out water from a suspended and lost well or to use ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tipy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-to-air dryers and air-to-air dryers.
After the washing and drying of the hands in hot-water dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the thighs.
Drying in the air-tight air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the body of the fingers of 42% and on the shoulders of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper tray, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent on average on the thumb and up to 77 per cent on the thumbs.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential with other users of toilets and the environment of toilets depending on each drying method.
The air jet dryer, which breathes from the outside of the air machine at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel the microorganisms of the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other users of the toilets as well as the environment of the toilets in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-water dryer allows micro-organisms to spread at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dry-water basin.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produd und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After the hands were dried, the following variations in the bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to the drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant tabs is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of hands in the medical environment became mandatory well after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands shake and fry.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As germs present in the water are likely to stay on their hands, it is important to wash well and try with a clean dish.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps prevent the hand from rubbing back on the surface contact.
The objective of washing hands in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms (the germs) and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical establishments, a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of blood infections related to catheters by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the area of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade may measure and certify the hygiene of the hands if compliance with the regulations is made.
The World Health Organization defines "five indications" concerning hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/bioliquids;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had a contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (candidates "medicines" or "antimicrobials") provides the hands washing agent with an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before surgery is performed or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frotter" hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, a chlorhexidine- or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and arms up to the neck, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When washing, it must be avoided that water on the front arms does not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, the hands should be dried with a sterile linen and a surgical cap.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of Staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the rate of handwashing beyond 35%.
If you compare the washing of hands with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the cleaning of hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing of hands with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium spores in difficult hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, in particular, to train hand-washing personnel, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to address them with written and verbal reminders.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap washing is considered to be a little expensive and essential tool to preserve health, or to eat properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal habits in the field of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hands washing rates may also be due to tight habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting the washing of hands in soap and conducting awareness-raising activities in this regard can affect political decisions, make known the benefits of this practice and lead to a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
In order to achieve this approach, follow-up and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies has revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low and intermediate income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. As regards the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Approximately three stars" can be cited, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioural evolution.After the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emotion illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy healthy life (i.e. prevented DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing in soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just been in the hospital or wounded soldiers, was first identified in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing care" British.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means to prevent the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the “good hand washing techniques” were placed next to the blinds in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "to wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash his hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of his wrong conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed acts contrary to ethics or had planned to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
Moreover, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of washing hands put forward in many religions, including Bahiaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual removal of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washing in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. The religions also prescribe washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is necessary to wash your hands after going to the toilets.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand that their hands be washed before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace
The risk controls of COVID-19 on the workplace refer to the implementation of health and safety methodologies for the control of risks for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary depending on the place of work and tasks, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to a COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest risk of exposure is a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, and the maintenance of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contacts with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but may be infected due to a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic prevention measures for infection, include high-efficiency air filter ventilation, hygienic glass and the provision of individual protection equipment in case of encounter with a person affected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as presenting a high risk of exposure, entering a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of others or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both as regards the goods requested and the means to acquire them (especially to run out of time or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan for preparing and responding to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community context risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also ignore the controls necessary to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise following epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of people at high risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the answers applied.
The Hierarchy of Risk Controls provides a comprehensive framework for health and safety at work in order to group effective risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolation of workers from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, and they can be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls indicate changes in policies or procedures to work that require action by the worker or employer.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. breathing masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced according to the needs, and properly removed, cleaned and stored, or put into service to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest risk of exposure is a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent the infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to touch and extend, providing mosquitoes and garbage, preparing for telework or hours of work as needed, encouraging workers to use the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining and disinfecting the working environment routine.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infected persons constitute a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other medications dealing with symptoms; they also recommend applying flexible disease leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a member of the sick family and to inform employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, medium exposure risk employment includes those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known but who may be infected by COVID-2 because of a Community transmission running around the company seat or because the person has recently made an international journey in a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes the placement of workers in contact with the general public. This includes the placement of workers in contact with the community. This includes the surveying of workers in contact with the large public, including in schools, high-den population working environments, high-den population working environments and certain high-volume working environments. The technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the installation of highly effective air filters for the installation of highly effective air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the setting of the installation of the hours of the hours of work, the installation of the installation of the extended working hours, the installation of the installation of the physical barriers such as the installation of the installation of physical barriers such as the installation of the installation of the hygiene and the installation of the installation of travel of travel on non-essential roads on the road to the regions of the regions of the districts and on the roads on the roads and on the roads and on the roads of the roads of the roads and on the roads of the roads and on the roads of the paths of the paths of the paths of the paths of the paths of the paths to the pilgrimage and to the paths of the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage and to the pilgrimage and to the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage and to the pilgrimage and to and to the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage to the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage and to and to the pilgrimage and to the pilgrimage of of of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of the pilgrimage of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the sick from the others by a distance of 6 feet, designing a crew member to take care of the sick and offering a protective mask to the sick or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of mosquitoes when he or she wears or wears.
The cabin crew shall wear removable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching the potentially contaminated organic liquids or surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protective equipment if the sick passenger is suffering from fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk controls include the removal of the journey in the event of a disease, as well as the self-insulation and immediate information of the medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop on board.
Ideally, a medical follow-up must take place in the insulated person's cabin. For school and child care facilities, CDCs recommend short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has become a school building, regardless of the community's spread.
In the case of a moderate minimum community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important meetings such as physical education courses or choir or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, ranging from arrival and departure hours, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In the case of a major transmission in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For the forces of the order that carry out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDCs.
Officers of the command forces who must contact persons with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use by means of a sheet or spray to house and follow the standard procedures for confiscating and revoking used EPIs as well as for confiscating and washing clothes.
The OSCE considers certain health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high exposure categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass a very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including in the conduct of aerosol-producing procedures.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
Samples shall be manipulated using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separation of patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPOs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons who work at least 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those who perform aerosol procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide higher protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those collecting respiratory samples, taking care of or transporting COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COPID-19 to those directly involved in its care, the use of EPI necessary for the specific task alone, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the IPI supply chain and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJET: [Covid-19] Light the load and prepare the future
EXPIRY DATE : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved right
We find ourselves in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human connection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening community at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, instant calls and conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are able to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud of all of you to be among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at present, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make adjustments in the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we have considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organization's viability during this period.
We had to eliminate the stress first and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week, up to the new order.
We will not state holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, race or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say so.
No sickness or paid leave is required: just prevent your superior and help your team to review schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from D&Amp;C Ops so that T&Amp;C helps you and ensures that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced it, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow members of our staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his normal working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to escape their stress from the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times such as this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE teams, Ops HR, Trust &amp; Security and Fund Collection (including) carry out an essential work that may need strengthening.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we are just going to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt any more later.
We do not intend to "work twice as often as possible" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to take additional hours to respect the time-limits now unrealistic.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their reduced working schedule in the coming weeks.
This extension of periods significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps as soon as they confirm.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator boxes leading to our floor.
The building uses its own protocol of diligence which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and with all Washington DC staff members its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with the San Francisco Councils.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues at work at a distance realized that adaptation could be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
To reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider sharing them over several days.
To clearly define the meeting, to have an agenda and to forward the documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and direct exchange.
Provide a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being reimbursement for the collisions.
Join the channel #remotes on Slack to talk to your work distribution colleagues
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinaires to support increased work distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editions, until the WTO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understood that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be punished in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness over the confusion and relief of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As a result, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Stay in touch despite the problems associated with COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special meeting of the staff on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff members living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have any questions about movements, events, important workflows or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for whatever else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support and secure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandoning our work and our obligations.
Rather than recognizing that at present, our work and our obligations are likely to need to be adapted in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the service that everyone can rely on.
Our planned work will be here to wait for us to come.
For the moment, it is time to get together and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, so you have to keep and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself the time that has come.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against angiotensin converting enzyme activity (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often designated as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a Peptide N-termination M2 domain and a renal amino acid collection area C-terminal.
The ACE2 is a single type I membrane membrane protein, which is active in the enzyme field on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular area of ACE2 is shaken from the transmemorial area by another enzyme called Sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: the ACE2 is primarily related to the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, the enterocytes of the grey intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE inhibits angiotensin I hormone in vasoconstriction angiotensin II.
The ACE2 rotates the amino phenylamine with angiotensin II carboxylic acid (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-Is-Pro-Phe) and vasodilator angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-Is-Pro-OH).
The ACE2 may also crush several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grain.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral-acid acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus at the source of the SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus at the source of the COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme field of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and in both the virus and the enzyme translocation in the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the storage of protein S by host serum protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the protein is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continued standard treatment with the help of ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to witness subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who presented a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less protracted than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin 2 recombinant human enzyme (rhACE2) is present as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in acute respiratory distress mucous membranes induced by lipolysis.
The half-life of RACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect (long) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to the classic renin-angiotensin (SRA) inhibitors or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, i.e. the identification of people (“contacts”) who may be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for designing contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographical location of users of applications, raise issues regarding respect for privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that enables citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have been in contact with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for an application named TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it was provided in open source and will be returned to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand plan to implement applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geoperage application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, referred to several practical problems related to the use of applications-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only authorizes "official" or generally trusted organizations to add applications related to the "coronavirus" to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Stimulators for the protection of privacy have shared their concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have laid down eight conditions for compliance with government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any excessive discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Act;
protection against abuse and use for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The "significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters without Borders (Report Without Borders) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by deleting the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network was approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which enables them to respect privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected tracking information from various sources, including data on the tracking of mobile devices and transactions by card, which have then been associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of the profound changes to the information confidentiality laws following the MERS epidemic that affected that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered using centralized systems that preserve privacy.
Details have not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, based on a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on solutions that respect privacy, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a unique protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matching data is made on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private life protection technologies originally based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and sanitation data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and protocols that are essentially equivalent in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a cryptography that ensures confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that respect privacy
direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way once the remote threat.
The replacement of a medicinal product (also called reorientation, reprophylaxis, re-location or change in the therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of an approved medicinal product for a disease or for a different medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the real project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papaine type protein, the NRA polymerase dependent RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribosis phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidates who were then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medications to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludin medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests of New York State on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would start on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency authorisation (U.S.).
Treatment has not been approved by the clinical trial process of the FDA and is authorised under the US only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of infection in SARS-COV-2" is not yet established.
Doctors have indicated that this medicine is used “when there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Higher studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a safety and efficacy test for the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen have confirmed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negatively within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half amifenovir.
The Italian drug agency reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the drug is false and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to care for patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump to buy the medicine. The medicine can be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to produce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicines have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for drug repositioning especially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several fibroviruses, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that redissivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, two of which were conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on subjects suffering from moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical tests on vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill from COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

One form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a phase II test is underway with 200 patients to recruit among severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over 40 years of age who have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women pregnant or breast-feeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosing was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the replacement of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as the MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-COV-2, a virus from the origin of the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been reported throughout the world in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomics published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the CEP initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEP scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were carrying out research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform in Phase I safety studies include:
nuclear acid (ADN and NRA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are at the first stages of development, 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (in the course of planning or design).
A phase I-II test results in preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted in several centres, with more precise effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (the "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pen vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that a vaccine should be started in 2021.

The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a Québec biotechnology company in Quebec, indicated to develop a particle similar to coronavirus through partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is in the process of laboratory research, with tests on the human being scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money to gain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ANNm-based vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on ARNm BNT162 is currently undergoing preclinical testing with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of his final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations on Epidemic Preparations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at the Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an auto-amplifier RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the launch of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly the same time, the Canadian government announced the $192 million C allocation for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national "vaccinal bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, said that "subunits of SARS-COV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro-hauls triggered an important response from the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-based computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia includes 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and its effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for Governments and health agencies around the world.There is no vaccine tested against SRAS.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on the SRAS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against an infection in the MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one single MDS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were underway; all vaccines were on a viral vector, two on an adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one on MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus was known from the origin of COVID-19 and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by various publications of social networks refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the coronavirus of the SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat discomfort, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may range between two and fourteen days.
While most cases produce moderate symptoms, some turn to viral pneumonia and failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly in close contact, often by drops produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
These droplets are produced at the end, usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on wearing masks by the public generally vary, some authorities decoupling their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the WHO's six regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, somnolence.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advised to consult a doctor immediately.
Uncommonly, higher respiratory symptoms such as swelling, nasal discharge or throat disease may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and studied. Korean Disease Prevention and Control Centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st, with a total of 166 infections observed today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and salt can both carry important viral loads.
Talking is freer than talking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that towing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples to the viral DNA.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and respiration (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and therefore cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about cell proliferation, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not yet know exactly how the disease is spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99 %.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and eliminates skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five patients in six, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, initially isolated in three patients with pneumonia related to Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the SARS-CoV of origin.
The lungs are the most affected organs of the COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme, which is the most abundant in the type II alvéolary cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care unit with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with adverse prognosis. The autopsies of deceased COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropical for epithelial cells of respiratory tract that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
These are in particular GM-CSF secretive T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrations have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal absorption; however, a nasal or waiting sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood samples taken at two weeks of intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization (PCR) response tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which are likely to detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test near the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan University Hospital in Wuhan suggested methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobular glass depoli opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Pleural domination, crazy paving (interlobulary septal spread with variable alveoliar folds) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleural, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia may be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudations.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
ongoing healing pneumonia: organization of exudations in alveolar cavita and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Sang: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD) ; leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding closed areas, washing your hands frequently in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mosquito when it is brushed or extended and using the inside of the neck in the absence of the mosquito.
A proper handshake after touching or extermination is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a fabric in public places to limit the transmission of asymptomatic individuals. The social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, by reducing displacements and by eliminating important groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "placing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently in the soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when their hands are visible; before eating; and after washing, having coughed, or exhausted.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, which is not "an active antiseptic substance for the hands".
The glycerol is added as a moisturizing agent.
People are treated with support that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and the support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being viral carriers wear a simple facial mask.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a lifestyle and a healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stages of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Rehabilitation and pneumologist doctors in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen on the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care when the procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for persons suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation room adapted to air-borne infection (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines on the use of individual protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respiratory masks (in facial masks) are privileged.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency authorisation (U.S.).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or last resort, artificial masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people suffering from respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-voltage nasal channel or positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is ignored whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-voltage nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to deal with a sudden number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5 per cent of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed respiratory assistance, and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during the COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and a high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen release and minimise the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatment starting in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
Remisivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new medications may not be developed before 2021, several medications in the course of testing are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medicine may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescent people as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The aim was to respect the quarantine and protect those who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate data on telephone location with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch, in order to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect persons who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, restrictions on movement, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate change with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rhume.
Moderate cases are usually restored in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe infection to COVID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SRAS and MERS, but data are missing for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can move rapidly to a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal failure being observed in 4% of those in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach of between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopatic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of the hospitalized had pre-existing pathologies; availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-recording of moderate cases may result in a reassessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current rate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and presented a higher risk of falling into intensive care or death compared to non-smokers. Concerns were also seen in relation to long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some people with disease, and pulmonary scanners suggested organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in the sick.
Immunities are considered likely to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people with COVID-19 who have followed positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an exacerbation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual source of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by a human transmission to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official publications of WHO indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed deaths in the laboratory of infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the deaths of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the global death report is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious mortality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnostics or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although all infected people do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and young people, producing a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been affected.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donors assessment.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among the 50-year-olds, the difference between men and women who are only 90 years of age.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this difference between sex are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be involved.
Immunological differences according to sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidity such as hypertension at a lower age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data related to the type of infection in COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCOV acute respiratory disease for the virus and the disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as fluxes and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency breathing valve and the supplier could not provide it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
Following the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complicit theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and were quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, canards and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use both ACE 2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the subject of research.
First, researchers try to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response to the human body in the event of a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on the specular protein S that helps the virus infiltrate into the receptor of the enzyme ACE 2.
A third strategy is that of nuclear-acid vaccines (cantonation by DNA or DNA, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. The antibody dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are under way in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reverse antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on resixiver in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of vaccine candidates and anti-COVID-19 drugs was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of resixiver in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with redesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are under way in the United States, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some demand an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation for the discretion of physicians caring for COPID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir versus COPID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial speculative protein amorses using serum transmemoral protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor of ACE 2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at subsequent stages of COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic antichoc properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study.
Phase 2 non-randomized tests are under way at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments which are suspected to be the origin of the death of certain affected persons.
The receptor antagonist of interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokines-relief syndrome to steroids caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems from persons who have cured COVID-19 to persons who need it is under study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the SRAS with little concluding results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
