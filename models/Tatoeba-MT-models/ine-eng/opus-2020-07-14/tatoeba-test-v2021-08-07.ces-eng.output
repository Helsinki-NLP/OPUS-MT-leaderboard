According to Tatoeby guidelines, members are recommended to either add words in their native language or translate them from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to make natural meaning words in their native language.

We ask you to translate the phrase, only if you know with certainty what it means.

I wonder how Tom got into my house.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I wonder if Tom's busy.
I wonder if we can save this situation.
I wonder if Tom slept with her.
I wonder where Tom is right now.
I wonder where Tom ended up.
I wonder who's gonna drive.
I wonder how many mistakes I made.
I wonder how much Tom knows about it.
I wonder if Tom's still tired.
I wonder what Tom really thought.
She was wondering where Sam is and what he's doing.
I was wondering when you'd be back.
I'm more interested in French speaking.
Are you interested?
Are you interested in art?
The forbidden fruit tastes the best.
I bought a new computer.
The school beat the teachers.
She yelled at him.
Hide your mouth when you cough, breathe, or sing.
I'm sorry, her hair was squeezing.
"I care about you very much," she confessed.
Please pour the flowers.
The deposit was paid.
He was hanging on her.
Put it under the roof.
She fell in love with a Russian immigrant.
Did you fall in love with her for the first time?
It's one thing to love, it's another thing to marry.
I shot the gun at the counter.
She locked herself in his bedroom.
Did I lock the main entrance?
I've been thinking about having this role ready this time.
Let him lie.
I can't blame you for anything.
You paid more than you had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid for the payment card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's ticket.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please turn off the radio.
Please turn off the radio.
Please turn off the TV.
It would be dangerous to join Tom.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Did you forget everything we did for you?
Forget it, it's not worth it.
Forget about this sad event.
Forget I said that.
You forgot to invite Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to put a sign on the envelope.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for an account.
I forgot my pen at home.
I forgot my wallet on the night table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to pick Tom up from the airport.
I forgot Tom could read French.
I forgot to disappear.
He forgot his briefcase at home.
He forgot to return those keys.
He'd sell his soul to the devil.
For the first time without crowns, for the second time I don't have time.
Did I get everything right?
The principles neutralize the acids.
I'm the last one to know the truth again.
I lost my chess again.
You're lying again.
You're back in your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talking.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We're asleep.
My heart's stopped.
Will anyone stop dealing with people?
He shot himself for unhappy love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot both of you.
They dragged her to the shop and raped her.
While I was reading, I called the phone.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already up.
You can still be with me.
You're not breaking anything yet.
The police arrested him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Shut the fuck up.
That's not what I'm paid for.
I'm not paying for this.
This is what Tom's gonna crush you for.
I can't do Tom's business.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
Because of Tom's mistakes, the whole group was tortured.
I love you for that.
I'm not paid for this.
In three months, Tom was dead.
They paid me five bucks for that bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call you back when I get on the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back for something later.
I'll call you back for something later.
He'll call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father, and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call the rescue!
They locked Tom in the shop so he couldn't escape.
I locked the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I've closed all six windows.
Close your book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Shut the fucking door!
I need you to pay me for all my translations.
Let's sing another song.
I rang the bell and I waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The weapons industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What's the butter made of?
I don't fully agree that this is how it works with me.
I sincerely hope he's happy.
She seemed to be silent.
I thought I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I felt like I changed my job.
I thought it was a bubble.
I thought it was a colleague's girlfriend from work.
I thought it was Tatoebe.
I thought it was this day.
I thought about Tom getting up from the dead.
The officer seemed to be worried about their revenge.
It seemed like Tom didn't realize Mary was there.
It seemed Tom has everything he needs.
It seemed Tom doesn't understand anything you told him.
It seemed Tom's not alone.
He seems to be very sleepy.

It seems too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
The spring seems to be coming very soon.
It seems like I'm still asleep during the day, but it seems like I can't sleep at all at night.
Looks like I did it for free.
You seem satisfied with yourself.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
I don't think anyone understands.
I don't think anyone understands.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
Looks like he made us a lot of money.
Looks like no one's noticed anything.
Looks like the war hasn't ended yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Looks like Tom's cool.
He seems to trust Tom as much as the rest of the people do.
It seems that Tom's not gonna do it, or not.
Looks like Tom's telling the truth.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember any of us.
Looks like Tom's been asleep.
Looks like Tom's lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
Looks like he's losing his motivation.
Here's the picture of my school.
We need to use the connector here.
We left home early in the morning.
I'm talking to her about this.
I dare ask Tom for help.

Ask your mother.
He made a sound, so everyone heard it.
He got a little radio.
He grew old and divorced, but he also grew rich and became famous.
From all his strength, he tried not to think of her anymore.
At first, I didn't like him.
Get out of here, please.
Get the fuck out of here!
