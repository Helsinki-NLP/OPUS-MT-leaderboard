Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also expects a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Police of Karatha arrested 20-year-olds after a fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was hit after the driver drove it in a 70 km/h zone and through Busland to get the police to Bilbao.
Transport politicians in Karatha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a tank on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stops and continued on the Burgess Road before he moved to the bush country where the officers lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karatha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop sign and reckless driving.
He will appear in Karatha on 23 September before the Court of Justice.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was brought to trial by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rapeing a woman in Scotland's hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep, and couldn't signal an agreement."
Webster is also proposed to have raped a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim in Scotland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating deadline for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present with the civil rights icon John Lewis the Staff Regulations.
This railway law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-traded forces.
The addition of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to complain before a civil court about justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - in any case not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill, are proposing the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlogs that the trade unions had suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a spirit.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized Autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and joint trade and trade are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or aim to distort this right are null and void; they are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, from which the General Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect his interests or to assist them."
For generations Americans have accepted the basic premium that labour rights are human rights.
When this country talks about how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After all these rights in America are under arrest, it is really very wise to keep the American ideal in mind, so that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but it increased.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story reminds us, and we should do so too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is a long way off.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and have fulfilled the promise of democracy.
The judge stops the temporary law that could force all the abortion clinics in Louisiana to close.
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana, from which the prosecutors said it was likely to lead to the conclusion of all five state law enforcement procedures.
This measure, taken by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and intended to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors carrying out the removals to require a patient admission right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions on a temporary basis while applying for such a right.
"The complainants can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to achieve these rights," said Federal Justice John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
The counsellors welcomed the decision recently made in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had taken so much time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana will pass a withholding law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the state's five clinics in order to keep the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment was extended to the doctors from the two clinics which had not joined the complaint and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of the 11 countries that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
The key to a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the state's clinics to close, was stopped by a federal court on Friday.
Advocacy advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that the rights of admission of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-fraud opponents object to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out trials in Louisiana has patient information rights, the center for reproductive rights shared with him.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop taking off, this doctor would, in fear of his safety, no longer perform the operation, the group said.
In its arguments against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their requests for patient rights would still be dependent.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher mortality rates due to eggstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video hommage for their mother who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of death to eggstock cancers than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, in which ovaries were detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small study: New medicines could slow lung and egg cancers
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of eggstock cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, and the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer at the time of diagnosis had already progressed, survival rates were the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of eggstock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspected a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecologist, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to overcome the distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, to strengthen the service of registered doctors in order to enable specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, provided a poor long-term survival rate for women in egg cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is currently published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret falling number of house owners
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of houseowners under 35, could result in tens of thousands of pounds per year being lost by garden centres when today’s young consumers, following a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the “Kernaltsgroup for Garden Products”.
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people spend on their own gardens.
The rise of people living in high urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting advances for parking purposes, and the decreasing garden sizes are further factors that threaten the sector, in which 5 billion £ per year is implemented in sales.
In the large area of London, where over a period of 6 years the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't plant.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a tour."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to the increasing number of households and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement of opposition politicians Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state television PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protestors back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending back.
At the same time, about 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Navaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied them with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police put in gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he denied it.
The army of the country therefore calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using no violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the State".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposed that Prime Minister Sharif be elected last May.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to insist on Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed at the time.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the country's top U.S. diplomats to obtain a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the business operator of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Mirror and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the previous US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany Ankara in the visa, provided for significantly worse reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning: Drivers threaten with consequences for pendler
The federal warning line of the driver on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The range announced for 18-21 hours covers all transport companies throughout the country, including rail, regional and S-road transport,
The main focus of the warning line is freight transport.

said the district president of the German company Locomotiveführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on significant results.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the alert is on freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police officer of the Magaluf of Corruption charged
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca for repression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-General José Antonio Navarro was arrested for corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the Malorca Diario online newspaper, the prosecutors presented evidence on Friday to the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the Combating Corruption of Mallorcas by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guard Civil in connection with the corruption proposals and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish National Daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said the government's vetting economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international hits in this summer due to a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who completed 24 men during a trip to Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the orderly behaviour of alcoholic holidayers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the reported alcohol-based knee tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio event took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together had to pay a penalty of 55,000 € ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular for young British holidayers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FERHLING has protected South Australia from a winter surprise, with strong spectators and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
At night, up to 21 o'clock, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down to Sunday night.
The last defeat was the result of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a guy who began just 20 hours ago and provided for almost 4mm of defeat in about 10 minutes.
After the last week of winter had taken care of an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The weather conditions are likely to lead to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to proceed.
Windfalls reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to start on a second flight of land and finally set off at about 20.40 a.m.
The delay in the flight resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, on Tuesday, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted, with possible spectators.
Mathies means: Maximum time to big network
In view of the elusive technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switch centres, our columnist Bernd Matthias is confident with a highly trusted electronic access.
While I'm writing this here, I look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's one thought behind it: If the cable weren't there, in the shortest time, all the listeners would fly around the house in vain, and that would be much more retro.
Yes, does it apply to the electron (electronic)?
No, error tip: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness of today's electric scrap of tomorrow is bought - obsolete.
And for example, who still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply saying that he basically rejects television.
Why these discussions?
Because the drag of theifa at the funkturm this week brings us back to our absolute incompetence on electronics issues.
The laity, the former washing machine and CD player blind control, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are expanded with unmatched ilm expert speech before it: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press post.
Yeah, is that right?
What should you talk to people who openly extend such a quartet?
In fact, it has been about 20 years in the first place since we were supposed to network our house.
In order for the Joghurt to order himself to inform us on the holidays on the Maldives that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning on our arrival...?
Yes, however, this presupposes a climate change.
But a dream will definitely come first: we lift our armband watch, they say, "Sweet!" - and at home the vacuum robot runs away.
Irre.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "Smoothing the boundaries between white and brown goods", rounds a industry expert, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data flash shows how long the pizza needs in the oven, but it doesn't use anything because we're standing in the mud.
We also know from the daily practice: If a new-modern device is used once really urgently, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspace, while rocket and mortar gunfire on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area of the struggles recovered.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket firefighters in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Passosh" child park, which was hit by a rocket before the arrival of the students of grenades from the walls and walls.
"We're a little scared, but they're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to go back to school all of a sudden.
"It was difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire last week, thousands of inhabitants of the border communities like Saad left their homes or left their homes in order to move further away from Gaza in safe areas and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border to Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian morse grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education shared that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Your children were temporarily held in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is severely affected by the Palestinian siege.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you gain knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unrestricted ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand for Hamas after the removal of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airports and seaports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fight.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes these data and considers that at least half of the victims are combatants, however, there was no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other combatants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the battles in Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protective rooms and struggles, last week the education authorities moved to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can learn more, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU visa Strobl asks for NPD bans
In view of the loss of voting by the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl has spoken for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the current ban on NPDs should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also head of CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to result in the political fight against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD was almost at the fifth-percent hour.
A first step for a ban on the right-wing party was taken in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution at that time also had informants at the NPD station.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day do not agree.
Hamburg: tents for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now being held in tents.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg takes place from all sides.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The area politicians were just informed - they are not excited.
"These Hauruck actions further undermine citizens' reservations and do not allow the district politicians to be constructively involved in the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, the Group of Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Your Party requests that the Harburg district administration provide unutilized houses for accommodation at the moment.
96 Refugees can be kept in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the first reception are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide adequate places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than regular for three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed that Sydney and Melbourne were operating a two-part market.
The figures of RP data show that domestic prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices average up by five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra is at the end of the scale, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rise by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr Lawless said that with the start of the spring now, there would be an increase in the properties for sale which would be subject to the market "a real test".
"If you consider the constant high auction price rate, a generally fast sales rate and the constant low interest rate, it is likely that your own home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and confirms this by putting on "like a field farmer".
The style of the university is not this, it's in the communication.
So the Medau family has already been informed "Mitte Juni orally about the school's opinion.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preventions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus.
It was a nine-metre wide street and it's not the talk.
It is about 5,50 meters, which is a meter wide as it has been," Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau drivers that their free and spacious parking spaces will then be used in the future only by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
The parking lot is not at all because it can be solved intelligently, as in other public parking spaces.
Think of the inhabitants
The Children's Kryppe Bergwechtil, located on the ground and before the house door would lead the access to the park deck, is expected to "not be affected" according to the High School President.
Rather, he says, "this is not only about the children's cry, but also about the residents at the invitation to the Friedrich-Strieb Street and the 800 students of the nearby Real School.
So it is about much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental counsel of the children's cry, with the expansion of the road would be justified by "losing the few natural-born spots of Coburg" "may the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Bamberg, will inform the cities about the construction of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new resolution".
Pierre Medau had informed the parents of the children's cry last week about the plans of the university.
Then the journey for the new park deck should not be as far as the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-straße, but rather the Medau-Berg.
This meant that the narrow road had to be built twice a mile long.
According to the Medusa's calculations, traffic in the Park of Castle Hohenfels would be spread.
From about 2000 vehicles the talk is daily.
On the side of the city, one did not wish to comment on the project until now.
Glandorf withdraws from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old SG Flensburg-Handewitt of the Federal liligist led to health problems for this decision.
The decision is not easy for me, it has been taken over several months.
It is time for me to hear the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the World Cup of 2007 told his Facebook page.
It therefore has a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 towers for Germany in the international state of rest.
Due to the desire to go back to Torejagd for the Champions League winner for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the islander who announced his camp for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me just as much as they will delight my long-term companions and my followers.
But for my club, I would also like to be healthy in the coming years, so that longer regeneration breaks are necessary which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear its career even after a Versen infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been treated by teammates of the German Handballbund (DHB) with a cortisone spray that later triggered a severe inflammation.
A notoperation and two other attacks followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the Board of Staff, which ended the dispute with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not go unnoticed.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012 in short distances, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
There are a number of other complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot be deceived," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be available in the absolute emergency.
"When all strikes go, I'm always ready to talk," explained the two-time family father to the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite weak in terms of my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the win of the Champions League 2014, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF Pokal.
In 2012, Flensburg also provided the European Pokals.
German economy in the spring by 0.2 percent cleared
The crises around the globe have stopped the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to end of June 2014 by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumer lived the economy in the spring, while the investments went down.
The foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual increase, for the first half of the year, a total GDP plus 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led the first time in the city of Burgmann on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion on Sunday of Dutch "Fietzenevährer".
The largest sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour through Münster, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Guerne for the organisation of this tour through Münster.
Published in various journals this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from Den Helder and we're going through the night to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münster this way once more," the bikers rejoiced over the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Associationsheim of the Schutzbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where it also started.
The route, which was written for three different categories, further led towards Herenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On lines of 95 kilometres with 1175 heights, 120 kilometres with 1475 heights and 145 kilometers with 1775 heights, the riders prove their good condition.
They were buried on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Heinz Lölfing's chief organizer Jos ter Hueren and Mayor's representative was very pleased with the success of this bike sport event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all the participants.
The organization died without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive picture of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the eventer had hoped, what was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"In 2015 we will see ourselves again in the hopeful weather of August 30th or during another weekend," the bikers promised to return to Münster and the organizers are planning a new one.
Constantin Weekers Unfortunately Honest Memories
It's actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, a songmaker, a pacifist, a political activist, a former prisoner, brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Munich born on 1 June 1947 wrote down its memoirs, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is unhonestly honest in this: From Onania as a gymnasium to loading steel and drug consumption, he does not allow human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellowman.
Wide space also includes abstract but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, being now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how not only the music impressed him (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the ascetic monk, who creates "through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
Among all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, over beatings in a local area frequented by GIs or a waving car, where he pointed out a tree frontal.
There he is also unhonestly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" treatments after his mother's death, and Henry is concerned about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to meet him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Listen with strength.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went with him to the button and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened up a caste in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a little bit brighter now, but they're dark, tasteful, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father just walked into the tub and then he was able to hear him sing slowly, because he was able to wash his hands.
When I got there, it became clear to me that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love.
My father didn't hug me, he didn't say "I love you."
Only when it went bad against my mother's end of her life will we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had lost as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That led to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "They must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and I also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's exciting.
Nobody likes to eat karotten.
Henry's career shift may be shown in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been united by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled their working lives.
He was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated individuals and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/Comedian on TV for a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient white counting machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a simple entertainment program in which people "black paint", Henry introduced his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it would never happen, but I don't regret having done it.
It was a unique, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly priced light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody black people."
Through the introduction of figures that made the British black culture both ridiculous and festive, Henry worked in the eightties on an alternative comedy circuit.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on a mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chief!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles played his next decade, but after his BBC series Lenny.tv 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or getting a little in place?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first sequence turned to Shakespeare.
I was quite allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mostly in front of a domain of the middle class, white in strippers and a coal head.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it again.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head up.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he came into the comedy of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break over now 10 minutes while they're repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the presentation continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from stage to stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sights.
And that's also good, so it's like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a WONNERNDEN voice.
So I'll stay here.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous eruptions, while he always imitates people.
I decided not to make stand-up comedy because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're going to have a wall.
I sometimes get alive in the Apollo when I like it, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give it back.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Jemens capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
It was also blocked on the way to Parliament.
Yemeni media reports a traffic show in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened the sheet with a further escalation of the conflict, so his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fights for more independence from the Sunni-dominated Yemen and calls for the government's retreat.
The Huthi people's tribe has been occupying the main Yemeni city for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding land, there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to suspend "Geister employees"
Kenya has thus begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete "spirit workers" from the government's cost lists.
Employees who were not registered in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, said a government notice.
The government assumes that thousands of people will receive even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his entry in 2013 to fight corruption in the public service.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month were lost in payments for "spirit workers" and other abuses of financial practices.
The government assumes that fees will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri tells the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials now need to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included, a government message was communicated.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the announcement continued.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also improving the cost list at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "spirited" employees," said Anne Waigru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the Kunstsadler Helge Achenbach is first negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a judge on Monday.
In the complaint it is said that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated purchase prices higher than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has bought for 121 million euro items for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of which he was the head of the school.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershauser and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn out by his efforts to see people in school.
The snowdrop is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
With 14 years of age, he was interested in higher education after four years.
A year later, the Germans were approved.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
That's how it dragged the judge into the over-frequent village.
The training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to run six times a week to the next train station, with the train going to Bamberg, there three kilometres across the city to go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping opportunity in a red cross house in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he made the first and three years after 1954 the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher for him, he went to Oberbayern and attended the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fruulein room" was his first "service" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he applied for a three-room service in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the St. Peterhausen-Kolbach school band and in Peterhausen five classes.
Since the school year 1968/69, these were collected in Peterhausen in today's Council.
When Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to move back to the lower school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Peterhausen grew up, and in September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to relate to the construction today, which was extended after retirement by judges.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who has also built a workshop at community expense and at the 1997 enlargement, although this was not compatible with the guidelines for school buildings.
"The mayor of Götz was very school-friendly," the judge thanked himself.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the contribution of a government representative who had responded to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love." Manfred Richter asked what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two-year-olds: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to find out, "That doesn't always work." Whether he's just talking to his students or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Justices Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When the students got sick, they didn't get a job and they didn't even get beaten to the backseat.
At the expense of the community, judges had two pair of boxing gloves set up and had the two opponents come up against each other, even if there should be a shield.
For the sake of the school, judges as Rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipality.
However, the judge was elected to the seat of six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 riders parked in the resort of Bad Salzhausen and Scottish intermediate stop
If the bikers on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Shots Rast, it's nothing special.
On Friday alone, however, the number of racing events was impressive: the 700 participants in the h4-Radour as well as accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg park.
Under the motto "Radel and celebrate on newly discovered routes between Nida and Kinzig", participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, where a concert of Van Baker & Band met there.
On Friday it was serious: the bikers took the first stage, which was 60 kilometres across the city to Bad Salzhausen and further to Shotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
In order to refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things have been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 candles of apple, wheat, strawberry and cheese cakes, which were wonderfully served by the hummingbirds.
"So many cooks can only cook women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking level of the Gyit-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could be created.
The "Duo Bravo" entertains visitors with well-known melodies from operats and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful environment of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman boasts a head massage from his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-assembled already run-cycle chains."
For this reason, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drink resort by Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to throw in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, since the first h4-Radour 2004 tour leader Tobias Hagen was able to take a short walk, he had a lot to do with on-site technology.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated through three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-chap motorcycle staff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from Gies or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westfalen, bikers are busy.
The number of participants depends on the available overnight accommodation facilities.
In Category I, participants are held in hotels, in Category II in collections.
From the resort, the bikers had a good impression when they broke up after half an hour: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they bought them for divorce.
After arriving in bulkheads, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the bikers were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the management of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival environment and, of course, had been prepared to cook pasta, for example, with well-cooled plumbing.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three appeared to be pleased with the "many operations in bulk".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move freely under free sky was used in spite of the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed with citizens who had been affected by the good mood as well as by the great scars of the bikers.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wättersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalds - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Hundreds of Turkish police officers arrested for "swearing" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "debt against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking policemen, reported Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they allegedly established an organised criminal association and had seized phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the Prime Minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities that the Islamic spiritual Fethulla Gullen and other persons are taking in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened after the summer holidays on Monday (September 1st).
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenj took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavjansk, visiting Jazenyk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their next life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, where the children wear stolen shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud sleep gap from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own experience.
Its career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which changed it to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was president of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the top posts of the Pearson mutt company went to a younger male colleague.
Its discovery was estimated to amount to nearly £ 1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when she sought out more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the advisor of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned keel.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence is in two directions: inside to the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures a nearly inalienable duopol that requires a complete reform.
But which new president would risk it to come forward, attack everything and join an institution that is as complex as a Chinese Dynasty, while he may even be concerned about his job.
It's a difficult task.
And if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatened with long, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is linked to special risks.
For the modest sum of 145,50 £ per year, the British public buys itself into the world's most probably largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC on the popularity scale goes up again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get today's news hit lines on my phone and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says the outgoing tweet was not allowed
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, included a note on Sunday about the democratic district attorney, who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him because of the abuse of official power.
The tweet was deleted later and replaced by another Perry user account that detracts from the previous one.
A tweet has been sent out from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I didn't buy the tweet and deleted it," said the later message.
Employees of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although Perry’s tweets went out of the official user account, it was not clear who was actually handling the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was painted, which was condemned in April 2013 because of tax fraud.
Perry introduced a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to go back to what might have been a charge against Perry - who might have been a presidential candidate in 2016 - led this month to Austin before a Grand Jury.
The text of the Tweet says: "I don't always go drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he announces it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry charged not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His high-class team of legal entities applied to the judge concerned with the case to dismiss the charges and argued that the law against the senior governor in the history of the State of Texas was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and is found in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to return.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his fiveth presidential candidacy at the elections in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at the Joggen near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction industry indicated that the apartment market in the southeastern England was again "turned back" to normal level.
Homes in the capital were hot and the subject of huge price increases, which led the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit blast, to set the upper limits for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of Berkeley's high-class construction company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this provides a "sustainable environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the divestment, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Catastrophe Office, prices in the city area increased by 18.5 percent only last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers increased by about a fifth in the past year and were at the end of April by about £423,000.
However, a stronger fund has made real estate property less attractive for foreign buyers in London in the last few months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric in view of the possible "Ville tax" in front of the general elections in the coming May.
In the last week, the London real estate agent Foxton warned that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger credit arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year in both real estate and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage authorization in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening domestic price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter a year, says the Maker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the wish for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts for the sale of time are worth more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of time remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost one third more than at the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent annually to £ 280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual preliminary tax result to £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in the afternoon in London trade.
Photo by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar lease.
The naked photos of Oscar prizer Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 stars.
A representative of the Star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and appealed to the hacker for "excalant injury to the privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will be persecuted by all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-share page 4chan were probably obtained by a gap in the online memory system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, a star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who see photos that my husband and I have recorded in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that there are photos of her acting and tweeting "These so-called head pictures of me are GEEFELSCHT, people.
Let's just turn down the beginning. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of Popstar Ariana Grande detracts the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly inspired new novel about love and the letter "J".
They burst, so you could describe it best, they slowly relax like a cardboard that you have left in the rain.
At times, a woman told him that he was too serious, stressful, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit fragile.
And then he shot his hand.
He had a heart attack.
He was boring, like in Igel, yeah.
The last victim of this stalwartness was a very startling affair that had been more promising for a smoothing of his life's only length, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a tender beauty with unstained hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more distant and rougher than the port of Reuben.
She had come with an older companion to the south, who held the caverns for her aunt, and had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spins, the nails had left their tracks on all the windows and believed they belonged to all of them, and the garden was overgrown with uncooked, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a babysitter, both threatening and captivating, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on the broken bodies in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually hot spring afternoon. Both had been spiritually absent in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and satisfying news, when the sight of its cross brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer who had been listening to his father at closed rolls in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their pure aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolessed, just like the word obsolessed.
The general taste made it what was never made of herbs and rules, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwasher-to-Millionaire Memorials, cook books and love novels, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sat down in a rough comic series of Ailin's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"That was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on her lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny right now.
He knew what he expected, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly prohibited.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Just like the mind.
His inescapability made people nervous.
And Jazz was a musically expressive mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without being one of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailin that Fat Waller was black.
At her age, she was probably unable to remember a time when pop singer was not black.
Again, no laws or obligations.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group participation - grateful as they were removed from the judgment.
People with afro-caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so sing and score them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks broke down counters.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country as quickly as WAS GESSES WERE, when ES GESSES WE were afraid to be accused of firefighting, even afraid that the flames would consume them as the next one - had opened labneh and shisha pepper restaurants, were concerned and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone's in his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailin found it difficult to understand how the poignant words that Kever had just given her could be demonstrated.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really poignant," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never punished anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sad feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the dampening of the huge carbonic leaves.
Ailin still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something butler.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She misbehaved her head and closed the eyes of Kevern.
There was nothing in the world to see other than her undamaged black hair.
There was nothing else he'd like to see.
"If you say so," she says without any conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're ahead of me.
They seemed to be very concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your knees, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my bones are too thick?
Do you hate it?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick knees are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little pervert.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble, because like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed in order to relate to the gruesomeness inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted it, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomon was red and rose up out of her throne, and threw down the console, and poured out the wine which they had drunk.
Holunderfloten wine, so trimming was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, they seemed to sit like Palm Wedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel perverse about you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the in need of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she leaned against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad after DEM WAS WERE their predecessors as smugglers and beach robbers, dragged from button to button, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or mocked them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick faust if she hadn't watched!
She only knutschen - knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the unsatisfied love ballads from the console - she only knuts and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the Knutschen himself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the weight of her grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know each other.
She saw him as he went away - just as her companion was seeing him from a room on the upper floor - a man, charged with something he had claimed himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, embarrassed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was it a look she seemed to know well if she could not remember the only time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin Solomon looked at her feet.
A few years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public opinion monitoring body, worked at a short lecture on continued violence at the lower and middle levels in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not expected, would be in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of that violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to weigh the inherent aggressiveness of a people who have led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has historically been hunted down despite the high-question church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be irrevocable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to arouse.
The population weeps at the hearing of sentimental dances, focuses on stories about overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of heroism and family life, yet not only does the former silence hold the rural communities as well as our urban costumes firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and sustained struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," she said to the mentor when he had read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme relied on her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
A feminist?
Go ahead and take it easy.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job free of prejudice.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable to themselves, may occasionally distort the results you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things, which you call "constant" and "roh", could be interpreted as well by others as the expression of natural force and vitality.
If one goes on to what IS, but IS IS IS, as if it were happening, it would happen yesterday, that means to take the country's essential life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED script in Flamingorosa repeated the advice he had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Listen to your neighbors, value your partner, listen to the ballads, visit the musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen to, agree to, apologize.
Speech is better than swearing, the singing word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out of it," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice, as she was sure that her predecessor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we are.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes, which only lead to what IS IS, WHEN IT IS IS IS.
This time, however, we are not the other ones to whom we let our anger and our mistrust go.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show an English patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe actions as "errors", which our grandparents may or may not have done.
They also go too far when you say that they would have let their "wage" and their "mistrust" out of "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as the protection of the present, we do not speak of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of him, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme waited to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There's no need to say anything more about it. That's where we agree.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, neither does it have to be charged if such an arrangement is appropriate and if there is a way to give it.
But what is the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is that we forget them.
If I can tell you something,
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapse.
"I'll think about her report," he said and let her go.
The next day, as she used to go to work, she was passed over by a motorcycle driver, who, as passengers described, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There's an accident.
Lesotho-Military Member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike against the government and said that they were going against police officers who were being attacked by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told him that the army of the country surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family into the neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of attack.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto state strike, but that the military reacted to the threat by "political fanatics", whose weapons were run by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that inside the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were in the process of causing destructive damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have broken the government by violence, all the reports agree that Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Talkers from Lesotho's military told them on Sunday that the soldiers retreated into their barracks and the situation was calm in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during the absence of the Taliban.
Thabane said that he believed that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he became a target disco.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after the ban on parliamentary sittings because of conflicts in his unit government.
He said that his actions had not been unterminated by the government, which would have been inconceivable.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the Eurozone slowed down in August at the lowest point of the last 13 months, such as a carefully observed study.
The final market purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a rate of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced break-ins in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be entered before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets are expected by the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the eurozone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether it is considering a quantitative simplification for the Eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at the market.
Germany's largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, the PMI factory for Germany fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation in the bloc, France, fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the rise in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industrialism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer affected, are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to affect the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs increased to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, a leading economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone since August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and are likely to result in some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, in particular major contracts.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB should finally introduce a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children who have been scattered there are still suffering.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken to a school in Beslan in southern Sweden.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world was shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had gone to death in the classroom at the Greueltat.
Just a decade after the brutal siege of Beslan's school, with 334 people, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists, children and parents on September 1, 2004, caught and killed at the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East into Abscheu, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst calamity.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom at the Grouelat.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of these terrorist hells will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed when she tried to climb back to the broken school hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famously tried to climb back to the school hall in her underwear only after a mine was exploded.
Aida looked for her mother Larissa completely confused, now 40 years old.
Both were held dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bloodstream.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put her in security.
After a number of operations she was completely healed, however, said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to operate again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become a dentist in order to help people as they were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says belligerently.
"That's happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to that something does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hall, in the opinion, his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russia went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying little child, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a ballhole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said: I could not save her.
In fact, Tamara was stuck outside and injured in the hospital, since she assumed that her son had been killed.
She said, after their reunition, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in there and he hugged me.
Damir was later fled to London (from the recently dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Championship from the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow in my memory.
I still know that I threw all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in court with, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially to the toys shop, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was just no children who could call and walk, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I have helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borsch and invite all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kellnern in a restaurant. Damir shot his water gun at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
They're just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they're tired or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir has grown big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he's not looking for Rache, he's not overwhelmed by the past strikes.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the spa hall and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he let it down - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, well-known, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked at me, and looked at the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't survive in this hell.
"I remember that I ran away from him, "Damir, run away," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgie Ilyn, 17
The boy whose horror picture after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's Greuel
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgi Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His blood flowed face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Czech terrorists shot down his class comrades.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for Beslan's barbaria.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had left him for his first day of school before she left to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's a long time ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are chasing me all the time.
No one will ever forget that I promise you.
The image of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was simplified as a statue (right).
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teachers.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also think that people in all the world can feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the wreckage of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is going to be a little scary.
"I can't understand how it is possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing like that.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It's attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few dreams because of the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the gym when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want my old childhood friend tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I didn't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and visited a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgia Faniow, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at the foot of a killer terrorist
One wonder: during the siege, Georgie Fanniev was caught at the feet of a killer terrorist, but he managed to survive it.
During the siege, he was caught in the spatula and sat next to the bomb, which was held at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and then felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there and don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after storage on the laptop
My pain is unforgivable and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, even the doctors, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to chickens".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
The children should not know anything about it, and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the day of the year gets closer.
I'm going to think about the holidays.
I know Georgia won't go.
It has to be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept it when something like this happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knees.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't drive any sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only strengthens my pain.
I've lost a lot of people that I knew well and were dearer to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart ran into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could catch and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby who was so attacked by a special deployment command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the horrors at all
The world began to breathe in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, disappeared, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the killer gemtel.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and with his new wife Swetlana has a little girl that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and is grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, saying neighbor.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of having girls on a pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing before a three-year-old girl on a walkway in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states, Mr. Steward has managed his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, argues the charge against the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most valuable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition that both have for about $300.
I recorded these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than 350 dollars.
Depending on the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery tray and other compartments are close.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have stage and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is capable of.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many won't hit.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see this under water, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So you're making a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a sort mode to make a series of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will become dramatically worse, as you continue to get away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to also bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is so much more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed width lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the qualms of treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife remembers, he was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were important for the diagnosis and disease, while the treatments were mostly concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel myself," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While he was struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he had made his wife Juliet impatiently.
"I want everything better now than later," he remarked.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite uncomfortable and uneasy.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was present.
He looked at Mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, so the skin that carries the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers in lung cancer have not been all lung cancers before.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, once as "wondering" but in the meantime it could be recognized as deadly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry volunteered not to use it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - klempner, construction workers, room people and advertising workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be of little concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is unacceptable.
Britain, it seems, today is experiencing the height of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the jet of the Mesothelium is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
asbestos was, and is often still in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And so Mesotheliom doesn't know any class scars, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos-depleted.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been developed as a starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a climber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy's hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pörtner - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least part of this question.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at the Guy's Hospital and who have been ill at Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us are still going to get sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomarks die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be the victim.
Most of them still don't know that they're going to die like that.

A brief view of the acts of the courts, which often affect the victims because of the claims for damages, shows the extent to which the jet of the Mesothelium has already been distributed.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, gave Janice Allen the opportunity to experience asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagshipstores in Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twins.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought I'd be concerned.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is now at far the most common asbestos found in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boulevard insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, yet it is considered by the EU and the WHO as a "high health risk" with possible deaths.
However, the brown asbestos (Amozit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspected that "it is clear, but indirect, evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomers."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma was caused by work or at home without any known exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our building.
It looks like nobody can get out of it, be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government as well.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service boxes and pipelines behind the Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be picked up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service pointed out that the Westminster Palace has received a "pure health certificate", there is no doubt that 1 billion pounds of work has to be put in place over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the delegates will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the Green Banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abortion suspect that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember in all places where you have worked and in the data.
What he remembers is the day of the beginning of December 2009, on which he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was conducting an operation just late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had a gunfight.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbot knew that the pain from the chest, the skin around his lungs, had come around.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors performed X-ray recordings of his breast and used pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and strong breath.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesoothelioma.
But even now it is not connected to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his house doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after the first time that abortion had felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually making it easier," he says.
To be honest, I didn't have to worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year: "Man told me it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It appeared that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he said.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos distillations in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees, who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (such as Graham Abbottt often did), came in contact with the toxic substances with the highest probability.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients may have been viable but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still leaving today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of his fabulous insulating and flame retarding properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have placed their buns burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And because of this, innocent items in our houses such as floor plates or sinks have been included by default as asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in most of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman in question was the abbreviation of a garden shower in the 1970s.
So be careful how to wrap your garden trunks.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to go on, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I was going and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
The biggest difficulty was the change in perspective from a doctor's position to one patient's position.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to come right with.
"It was very difficult to take it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long have I had?"
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly domestic because it is our life-saving mechanism - the soul itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
The asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is absorbed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be found in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thorax doctor who moved to the Guy's hospital in 2001.
The exact hospital, by which Andrew Lawson suspected that it had exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasures knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well at Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is strongly disputed.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure protects them.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because the cancer "not very good at chemotherapy," the "acting" is not healthy.
"There is sometimes a long-term survival," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office four years after his diagnosis.
"Hallo, cancer center," he presented himself happily when he called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, abortion was offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and likely prolong his life for only one month.
"I was disappointed," he said.
I wanted to quit.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred to further, I just called and got a appointment," Graham said.
A normal patient should receive a transfer and wait for authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma diseases in order to be able to experience the best available therapies.
However, if these treatments fail, many people are concerned with another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hope of forgiveness.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the company's legacy began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally attended, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-value compensation" since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy.
After examining his death, however, a guy's speaker confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma diseases that are trying to compensate for an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance claims may be lost.
And those who deny claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the arguers.
As a response this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom concerned to complain of compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to find it.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and can prove contact, but cannot be claimed by anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 per cent of what a court could have agreed to in a normal damages procedure - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom people that £350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that in this sum it is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time hadn't gone by and Mesotheliom diseases would find the companies and they could claim them normal.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, added that the law was "not perfect".
But both penning and Morgan added that in view of seven deaths a daily rapid action is necessary.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, contrary to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," said Abbott.
That's what you always see in patients.
There's something that can keep you going.
If you give up, you're getting worse.
Graham Abbott was involved in the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of disease.
Then in March 2014 I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's vital.
Again, Abbott studied six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumor is visible.
But the process is very physically and mentally challenging.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boile line setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look in front.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease with which I wouldn't get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very polite and rude.
She told her friends, and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to go through.
But for mesotheliomarks, such conversations are not through hope, not from a trace of hope to survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear compensation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong Election.
This action is likely to be accompanied by the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to this in less than an hour after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking had promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong are angels.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong citizens have a direct right of choice, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the course of a closely-controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general elections.
On Sunday evenings, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any more detailed information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "has only taken into account the establishment of the central district as the last means, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the establishment of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, have been intensified on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose control of their city slowly.
The increase of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement as they threatened the business - the living seed of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they will last," said law expert Regina Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want to worry that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the electoral rights to which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closures in the United States will now be transferred to universities where fresh performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this request and to offer the first luxury travel service to UK students from today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a safety component.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut off their fatigues in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there are no new bookings yet, as the service was just introduced, added that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also reported that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than making a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of most students.
Many students who start this month with the study face a crisis of living costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of credits and grants does not take a step towards the most simple life-based calculations before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving in the student home.
Feminists criticise race and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hand up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and were observed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "Thanks to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in feminism who are about the white and who speak privileged in such a high-class manner," she said.
The people felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something about how colorfuls in their own country are under siege, it's deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors do the opposite.
"between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were born, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for election rights could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power is aware of why white women do not believe.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Also after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women were organised against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time in which white feminists "fence" played with the problems with which black women have been separated for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists who have the right to raise a child through such traditional feminist platforms are as serious as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built up their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to preventative resources are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a targeted article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand one of the inherent dangers to the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public affairs - will be brought about the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather cross-sectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race theme in America are quite surprising.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said against She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were bitter reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship to the black community is not the only problem that is forced into the background of mainstream feminism.
After almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors were arrested at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-view of the topic as an essential woman theme they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a nest in women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate makers, when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also belonged to a pig that had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connell said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo, however, has been mispublished and has been removed in the meantime," said a spokesperson of the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connell described the former assembly house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house in the social media was of interest, as some asked whether the pig contained in the purchase price.
The SW-City of Harvey houses a new millionaire after Lottohein
A lottery player from Harvey this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth takes place, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper review in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still needs to report.
The shipowner Steve Forward said that the profits provide for conversation in the small town in the south-west of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a gain might occur.
Eight WA winners won in the first division last month, a payout for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had only a few weeks before winning the megagammon of $7.5 million.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the profits allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with almost $85 million in total.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators kneeling in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romer day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors from far away yesterday, who despite the rains and the spring cold and left unwelcome from the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful rain of paintings, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was no doubt the martial fighting force of the Gladiators School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiators' owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring for a bright double match in various gladiator statements.
At first, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as legs on the left leg and arms on the right arm.
It followed the "Esedari" with chest shield, short sword and root, as well as iron gladiator helmet, bone and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarios", which attacked the "Secutor" with a tug network, dreizack and Dolch, and after a short battle the bursches came to the ground.
There, the heavy metallic forces worked together, the shields created, and the root plants flowed by the arena, that a fear and bang could become about the health of gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular judge, had an ever-attentive eye.
"We wanted to bring the Roman daily life back to life and make the culture of the Roman times viable," explained Lorenzo Euskirchen, president of the organizer "Freundescreis Romancanal", the intent behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "oppidum Romanum" was found from the leisure park for a day, a Roman city, as Vice-Citizen Master Claus Wehage found in his speech.
Finally, not only did the Romans bring war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous constructions that we still admire.
The rest of them were also to be amazed at the day of Rome, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which was at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once put the water and energy supply and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the times."
This also confirms the diploma measuring engineer Ralph Heliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented the measuring instruments of the Romans such as Cromat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hippocaust, the warm-up tethering, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footpaths of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverförförfunge Rheinland had dug out the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Business Park in Rheinbach.
It has been found to cover the walls of an economic building with a hole to dry grain and flour.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morsheiser.
A number of pieces from these excavations were presented in a glass vial, including a large counter, several fine glass vessels as well as parts of a irony necklace.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspected.
In addition, the children were involved with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's milling game, or they were writing their names on wax tables as the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Romanthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and at the stand of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat break or a muzzle.
With the original stone car built by two cold-flowered tourists, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed by the impressive position of the City Gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Watchberg will also join the Romanian-owned Roman Year 2014, which was to be remembered for the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verin, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guidance for school classes are offered and remember the Roman history of the Watchbergs.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work on the next Watchberg will be told, plants presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a wise lesson in people's understanding between a group of Watchbergers "Germans" and accessible Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the theme of the Rome project within a week.
With the Rome Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Watchberg will be made visible again.
In the Watchberger Rathhaus a small presentation will be remembered at the end of the Barkumer Matronenheligum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs on the West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are fragmented - and international companies go away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic puts the West African economy at a serious disadvantage.
The crop is broken down on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are broken - the virus has made the region difficult.
Some international companies have already gone far too.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says African Development Bank head Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for the disinfection of Ebola are on the market.
Liberia was the most hit by the virus, and here alone, more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had been caused in every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands more died.
Absence of employees from foreign companies
In all the resource-rich countries, companies are putting down their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer operate the regions concerned.
The local traders and farmers also respond: only a few buyers leave their homes to provide after-supply.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the coffee and coffee beans that are important for export on the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Food becomes scarce
"People are getting less and less travelling," says Phillip De Vreyer, Pariser expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables remains at home.
The population therefore has to sense the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stock of basic food is wasted like rice.
At the same time, the highly dependent region of international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger was that international companies would actually have a long time on the ground, says Philippe Hugo of the French Think Tank Iris.
Determined how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression may arise, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest," warns Hugo.
The disease also weighs the state's state budgets.
The disease also weighs the state budgets of the countries concerned without penalty.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely penalised by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the northern region of southern Niger has not yet been affected.
But nowhere else many people are already afraid of a setback.
Reservations in hotels also go back clearly.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The association "Tannenwald" Bergau celebrates its 50th anniversary festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Tannenwald Association, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the Festival were held from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
At 6 p.m. on Saturday is the big baller's shot.
After that, he is in the big festive evening with the "Stoopfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blascapelle provides music
The highlights on Sunday are the Feast Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large fortress train at 14 a.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gauschieß.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 stanzas with their dirdndln.
The hard hat is the blasphemous Bergau.
The cabinet has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original term "schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Bergau" comes from 1907, when the Association for Social Entertainment was founded on March 21st, when it was founded "by training in room-students and small-caliber shootings".
The NS regime had triggered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 have 19 young men again met, who, on April 30 in the guesthouse of Lukas, raised the "new" protective association "Tannenwald" Bergau out of the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the association as a gunman through a difficult start time when it was mainly about finding a club and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the association of the shields started in the "Leininger" guesthouse with two teams in the round game.
In the years following, the sports shields, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The union record was held every year and the magical boundary of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of active protections has increased, so have the number of members.
After the "Leininger" association has no longer met the demands of a modern protection association, then the board under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, Pfarer Strasser gave the church blessing to the new protective rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was the 44th Gauschieß, associated with the celebration of the new firefights in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Association of Protection celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995 a Boller Group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became a Boller referer.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and the Association as a whole was the orientation of the 2005 Bavarian Böller Meeting.
In many hours of official work, last year the members of the association have modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Bergauer Court and thus brought to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round-up combat
See also the sports services of the Association for Protection.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round-up struggles: six air defence teams, one air gun team, one KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was set up in the round 2013/14 by Gauoberliga (the highest league in the Gützgau ANB) in the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga North to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as boxing, fascists and kingsball, association excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the shields are also at the feasts in Pfarrey and the municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time, after his right front ribs were placed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-chap team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can make it better there.
Stewart had already taken off on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush in a wall and had to let the right side of his car repair.
"I have entered into a good result with pretty good hopes today," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't hit."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the locker and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup races fall after his car hit and killed another driver in an ash train race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to his workplace, while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr.. This was taken on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart must be charged.
The three-time champion was received with a great surprise when he was presented before the race.
After starting at 12th position, Stewart was soon in the first 10 moves and was on time four.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs runs
Vehicles with No. 18 except for control after the exit of Curve 2 and collid with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but he fell back to place 21.
Search for dance-frequent awakening
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Lissa Neitzel (left) are looking forward to the match.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV Jahn are also creating the whole day's education at the leading schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become very demised.
Now enhanced growth is sought for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
More active would make it much more fun, "you could dance entirely other choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can join the former Hotel Meyer, Freisstraße 9, between 17 and 18 on Friday or between 17 and 18.30 on Friday in the dance sports room.
"Training starts regularly with a heating program," says the coach.
Then various choreographs are introduced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements of folklore from classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, society is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've stayed in the dance room once," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you could close friendships, share a wonderful hobby and still do a whole lot for your own motor development.
Who doesn't like jazz dance, it can also dive into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always in the middle of the week in children's dance/jazzanz, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop in the teaching.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the Tanzanian evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who has a appetite for discofox, slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can pass and join.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a national protest before the judiciary in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Higher fees are also on a demand list to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Christo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting for a month symbolically against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the encounters between the prison staff unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued, the Director-General informed the BNR of the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The opposition of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union Association of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has resigned from Luhansk Airport
In Ostukraine, the prorussian fighters are still on the front march.
After a severe battle, which allegedly included Russian Panzer Battalion, the Ukrainian army today, on Monday, gave up the airport of Rebellenhofburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously brought personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership without mentioning details.
Shooting aircraft from Prorus separatists
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists once again fired a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
In addition, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, the rebels reported on Monday with Russian agencies.
Coast Guard Ships Reduced
The rebels also claimed to have reduced for the first time two boats on the Ukrainian coast guard in the Asowska Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media make Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donezk were under their control.
Diplomatic offensives in Minsk
The Ukrainian contact group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the preamble, all actors used their performances to make public their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a broken breach" of the agreement.
"Today, we must see the reality in the eyes of Russia that it does not view NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, "they view us as opponents".
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
At the NATO summit in Wales, "Readiness Action Plan" will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official data, agreed on new talks to address their gas dispute.
The negotiations will be held for the next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.
A decision of the European Union is still pending whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
As a result of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia since weeks.
Last time, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop supplying gas for Europe.
Europe refers to about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Tag speaks Power word: Mout will come "full light"
Now the chancellor recognizes that.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has grown as a result of severe concerns from the CDU against the Pkw-mood.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has, after persistent opposition from her CDU, spoken a power word for the introduction of a Pkw-mout.
"To say it clearly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
In a detailed model, however, Merkel did not set itself first.
In the black-red government programme, "defined parameters" are called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal and is now working on it".
However, the NRW-CDU maintains on its nein to a wall right on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructive in the consultation on a draft legislation.
In addition, he spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." On Sunday, Schäuble had left a mirror report uncomplicated, his house examines its own concept to pay off autobahn investors with morning incomes - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned the cabinet to develop wall concepts against the federal minister.
The CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never came about to build all the district and federal roads," said the Nordic-West CDU president.
In other words, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced once more to talk about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-land associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
There are fears that a single moment will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition trust due to the moral criticism of the CDU series.
The left sees the plans in view of the conflict in the Union as doomed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said Partner Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the death of the Minister, Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignett obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may, however, not be charged in addition to the Coalition Treaty.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the murder over the Kfz tax.
The model must not prejudice foreign drivers, however, in accordance with EU law, because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman said she thought as a result of a misdiagnose over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure walk and curved toes.
Illnesses also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedrich Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad survival prospects.
Rogers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years of age today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted with me for a while.
I could never ride with the other children's wheelchair or skateboard and was often at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her feet, she used her medical records when her doctor had left the room and let her go to FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and scared in panic.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 and then slowly lose all my abilities.
I did all this alone with me and planted my own appreciation.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not been as strong as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and he hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness Month to pay attention to this disease.
Stabbsfeldwebe a. D. Berni Dieter has been working since the closure of the former camp practice site as a fireworker
For almost ten years, there has been no shooting at the former training site in Munsingen.
However, every month, a dying ammo appears in the heart of the Swedish Alb biosphere region.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be pushed on the spot.
An earwashing knot is held by the explosions over the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen field, which was closed after 110 years of military operations at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of the large area is the core part of the Swiss biosphere area, which has been opened on 13 routes for hikers and bikers.
Tax on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax returns for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to public and local authorities in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company's government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 per cent in the past year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the decline in discretion 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre was carried out by a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in the recovery of the company's real estate values, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate tax by 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these gains came from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the outcome seems to be also for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion to state and local real estate tax last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery at the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate tax here is running on just over a fifth of the corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate tax," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services that other States offer.
The latest recovery of corporate tax revenues cannot be calculated solely for the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland included $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The growth rate in the district was 4.3 per cent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Virginia alone reported an average tax increase of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas the significantly lower corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district at a relatively high rate of 9,975 per cent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce its corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3 percent.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be better off, and they pay more government and local taxes, so the latest study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure, which most small enterprises are organised - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than the total company taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general tax revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be withdrawn if the reduction in the spending of the federal government affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hoppen and Malz - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, born in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - says the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle down in our city," said the vice-partner of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the Chinese ruling Communist Party returned in the course of the discussion on this issue of twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Warb Li.
That is why people also possess the purchasing power to make German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, cereals and life's joy," he added at lunch with the partyer in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out to Mr. Li, he mocks the host.
After that, the officer from Guangzhou came up with Schäfer-Gümbel - however, with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German offer of purity.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Partieichef Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the municipal politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to increase."
Currently, travellers had to take the route through Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, which is the capital of Guangzhou, also looks forward to the airline.
The vice-president of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire forward in his discussion with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance of Germany, agreed.
Managed partnership
Guangzhou's ridiculous vice-partner hopes he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only entered the office this year after his predecessor had been transported from the office due to corruption.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a countrywide campaign against corruption in party and administration conducted by Chief of State Xi Jinping with hard work.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company in front of his career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to his entry to Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km-long Guangzhou belongs to those who are treated by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis at the Perlfluss is almost as strong as the whole Hessen with its economic power.
The next year, Li reportedly wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the pigeons"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago; her daughter, however, today, was hoping that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after a heart attack in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors will sit down and carefully observe until they are more satisfied with their condition, which will continue to be described as "nurst".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can identify central data at a glance such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" category of pollutants applies more stringent nitrogen oxide values.
There is also more money for the farmers: they receive a national minimum wage of 10,25 Euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it seemed as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was a cool billion-dollar thing, and the collaboration was also natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their puzzles in games, a "Youtube for live games", such as an insider.
The switch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which the better known (usually older) games give a hint of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, something long-term, an example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a puzzle why the deal with YouTube failed, as the company was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer sports to watch, it's hard to understand the attraction that it takes to watch others when playing instead of taking control consoles into hand.
It's one thing to look at a friend about 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she's sick by resident Evil, and something else to see a spider shooting in his head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are today ego games, so the promotion without its own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-tracks in which the Roger Bannists of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it's not a game or humorvirtue, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called from 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are traded as advertising customers.
Like the president of Twitch, Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of gambling," and the media does not show signs of collapse, not even - stroke - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg, at the Burggarten Festival, there was a few going out on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainstorm on Saturday evening, 1200 musicians came to the open air festival in the castle garden.
In time, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sacharj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is intended to shed light on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors appeared to open air.
A feast for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they did it.
Around the supply points in the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings, had enjoyed themselves.
They followed the first live performances, blew up with the foot in the touch, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and pleasure were said.
And that's what happened to the generations.
While one on the roofs of the extra-carried white sand on the beachbar, others were swimming on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the new growth fell on the Hüpfburg, which was a great point of attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when the child was born, the volunteers had to do all their hands to be the opposite of the Lord and beautify fantastic creations in the small faces in the true sense of the word.
The sizes used the Kickertics or participated in a skateboard workshop set up by the Goodfoot Crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he approached the visitors, especially the families were looking for the width and the dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not bring this down.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who said of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, a repetition of the large party was not opposed in the coming year.
If the content and size of the event still needed to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first budget on Sunday against the vote.
As he was angry, he said that the entry had to be stopped at the same time.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too few forces.
The following: Some who had already paid were no longer on the ground.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the salzwedel co-organizer spoke of some 1200 visitors who went to the castle.
There were problems with sound technology.
The hip-hop band blocks`n`Rox broke down its appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-way sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltweel because of a tyre tyre.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The Amula-Open Air premiere was more successful than the number of visitors.
And it's in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be dealt with for the first time, but have to be eliminated for the second time.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some not only cheat, but they're also really trying to put something on their legs.
Get off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now there is a year for the organizers to postpone these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's scarves
He is not expected to be like that.
However, the part that is ready to be used in the remarkable construction works is expected.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the hole, called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radius will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step towards the completion of the new vault is the exchange of hats
The upper quarter of the old cave is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new cave is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket-Chalenge take care of Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Book-Chalenge went painfully.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had cried so much at the Ice Bookt-Challenge that she chose the buyer.
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, was so shaken that her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my chef remained simple," she said about The Mirror.
Ice water is protected over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't the case, the chef was angry, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and my sister saw it too and almost got into the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was transferred to the hospital to allow the chef to re-enter the viral trend on Tuesday after participating.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castles pull back on a string?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfrathauser Burgvereinen.
Now the chairmen are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfrathauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfrathauser Burgfreunde, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The points discussed so far seemed to be how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps move towards each other: Talks about a common approach should be held soon.
This is confirmed by the Associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and proposed that we should be able to get together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could draw on a string in the future.
So make it more visible to record success.
While the castle friends around the sudden death of Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, the "exhaustion and survival" of the site stands for the castle around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the castle friends, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been standing before the castle friend.
A new chairman is to be found at a meeting in mid-September.
At the moment, the association has about 40 members, according to the 74th year of age.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the union activities rest out of respect." This "dunk phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the meeting with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood picture within their group.
A candidate for the presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find you." He doesn't want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a tungsten houser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much like to continue".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will likely remain in the eyes of Piffls soon.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Through the high participation of the population as well as by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have come to believe that it is more and more meaningful to advance the project. A "all-setting feature" could be created for the city of Fößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction is therefore not simply to be thrown overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "it's important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clever ways to save on uni textbooks
Since the cost of uni textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fixed-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered himself a smarter sparidee.
He invented a rental system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, visiting the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He left 120 bucks.
The college led the students on average to spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but there were various cost-depression options for the students.
Online songs and creative ways of accepting as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a long time, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university books, shared that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Investigations in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college books were rented in the last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus books according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online only cost a third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs nearly $290, but can be referred to at the specialized bookstore Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If the notes of other or normal uses do not make any difference, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is required on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenses are permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminars are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them in some way well, think about giving them back and you don't want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business in which you are renting, including the penalty fees that occur for writing notes, hints or tracking.
Rented tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 dollars.
Bracey says students in literary courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each other.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check out Gault whether the book is actually pre-conceived.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in college bookstore.
Why didn't the Guardians of the Galaxy become a boxer?
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his $70 million budget.
The movie "Sex Tape" dedicated to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like "Heats made easy 2" were also disappointed at the receipts.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin shows that children's films may have a lack of quality in films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "slightly made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for an older target group it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average CinemaScore and Metacritical assessment for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 canvas walls in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and pointed out that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-appearing jungle book film, said about the Hollywood reporter's website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash flow of Hollywood productions, netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost doubled as much as in the previous year, in which revenue amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on comics filming and prophesying a "cranial melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the present demise, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash flow in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said about Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the movie casino, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
After a few years ago, the 2nd table tennis district class for the purpose of penalising the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3. Federal League into the programme.
The consequence: He who is not raised shall be taken away.
Thus, the top team Torpedo in the Oberliga Relegation has avoided the decline, but only five classics play in the coming season.
Four-class Torpedos ladies remain in the regional league, despite their grand tour.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Vienna.
The SG Langlers and the Torpedo Reserves are in the new League, in which the Landesliga are no longer represented by Göttinger Clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Associationsliga, the Torpedo-Two in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better class of districts, is now the new districtsoberliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Topender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league they play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, red-white, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies begins at least in arm's length.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen run in the district league.
With every nine teams
The SC Weinde sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district ligament of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with every nine teams.
In the west shelf are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the east barn, among other things, satinhausen/Wöllmarhausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfhausen are playing.
The Lady-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen II, Bilhausen, Heavens, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circuit, where there are no women's teams at the cross-country level.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd cycle reaches the target strength, the innovative and circular board will have to think again.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called opposite summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments this weekend and has spoken to demonstrators traveling from Bridge to Belgium.
Teenagers escaped from the Blue Mountains
AS YOUNG bus drivers were put in safety with the sail wind after they were caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leap.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock when the two of them didn't return home.
A search group of local police and rescue services broke up, and the couple were found about 23 hours close to the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man was upset and had his head hit.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they escaped on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a car in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Scale government enemy protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said.
After a good half hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Atar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with pieces would have damaged devices in the editor.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government, to which they propose election fraud.
The police reported that around a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, it had come back on Monday to meet some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
A police officer was injured after hospital charges.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to force Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using no violence".
It further stated in the Communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the State".
The escalating violence has caused concern against an intervention by the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests made by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to pick up.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to retreat," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similar.
Khan proposes to have won the parliamentary election by fraud last May.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had first peacefully held before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to insist on Sharif residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after the second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 above large, a biter week for Rapid ended on Sunday.
"The victory is very free," said Coach Zoran Barisic, whose team with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday had reached an intermediate.
"The success experience was unmistakably important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who took three seats with green white.
Schrammel-traumtor brings Rapid to victory street Rapid has shown with the second season the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success in the country's game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his wonderful leadership volley of the sixteenth century in the 14th minute, won the tenders.
"I thought I was keeping all the frost from Thursday clean and slammed it under the latte," said the 26-year-old laugh.
When he had met in a federal league party for the last time on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first race in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm from the Rapid Post-Growth," he said.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beckoning, shame turned from left to right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirror traffic.
The gate he earned, he's already made some assistants," said Barisic.
Team shows Character Schrammel also delivered the flag to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written in full.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," also noted shame, which led to the break-up of performance and result in the past few weeks: "The results have not been successful, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "in many games earlier than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team's outfit is intact in spite of: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less happy for him: "That we have finally played again to zero".
A lot of work during the country's game break also the condition that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several occasions to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starters, making the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who were very stable in the past time."
The country’s play break should therefore be used to “luck the walls and put a little in the physical area”, said Barisic, who has five U21 selections in his series.
One who is likely to have a special break is Captain Hofmann.
He's falling apart for the team, he's going through pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admiral).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is good now" "We certainly have also had a bit of luck, but sometimes the happiness has to come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He urged freely to concentrate on further work: "You must not always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He couldn't fight the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grand Coach Michael Baur had little to offer and his team.
He regretted the fast encounter "from the category magictor", as well as the regular door of use in the 40th minute, which had been discovered by dissident collegiates.
The only suggestion that I can make for the team is that we were not specifically enough towards the gate in some phases.
That's where we've had too little conclusions.
Integrated Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a door.
In large and in whole, there would have been more.
Under this fan, rest reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle work of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Luck" last Friday.
Several of these tree cracks are still in the countryside, the illustrated copy is the "white smoke" above the under-white fountain.
A step-by-step leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It goes past groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometers north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it is located above the other trees of the surrounding area and remembers with an extent of more than eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intense research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim Archives and asked older people from under-white-brown to find out what kind of application it has with the gypsum.
The result of his research remained the fairly polite statement for the name.
Then, up to 80 years ago, the goat goats were to drive their animals from under-white brown to the hard-brown and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal hats created by the climb were to rest.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows they actually feed back to goats.
The area has also been declared the core area of the biospheric reserve, and Schneider has found out more.
However, in the presence of stone collections, caution should be exercised, since the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for cruisers.
A trail leads from underwhite well to the tree, but something is hidden.
Further paths are indicated, the direction of the high hall rises and invites you to an extended hike.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is sought for in our next task is rather rare to find.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the countryside, to which the building can fit.
Where's our piece of Rhöner's luck?
My piece of happy Rhöner

After a week of divesting Italy's Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance on the EU special summit last week, the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, will be the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers that, as La Repubblica’s government newspaper reflects, the calling of Mogherini, also in the government team as a favourite, to strengthen the position of the social democrats and their own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that he will be able to bring peace to the ever-changing left party base, because Mogherini will be assigned this - even more mildly - to him.
With regard to the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will be drawn up in order to provide a political compensation.
Because the EU's chief diplomat will be the representative of the Commission President Juncker at the same time.
The remaining consent of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have referred to the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "significant recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades it has proved to be in leading parties and that Mogherini, known for its pride, will grow to be the "abundant challenges".
The devout Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Their careers began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratics di Sinistra (Links Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party in 2008 to the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth) for three years.
With the 2001 election in the Left Democratic Party, she joined the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
She had traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO's deployment in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which accounted for over 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU's elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share.
The maintenance in Brussels, which new EU external officers have too little diplomatic experience, is therefore lacking in substance, is counted in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltics, the tragic realistic accents of Mogherinis are being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine, and it has been defined as a "peace-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to South Europe through the Russian natural gas surrounding Ukraine, as well as the Italian energy security.
After Renzi had become EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with enthusiasm, as well as the Kremlin Chief for October as an economic summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-hanauer on Monday in Nabburg.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will work in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechanics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the Schandorrf district: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zanner from Pfreimd, and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainers first visited primary and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages, as well as the trainees, will take a team-training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the inside are on the program.
The company has 435 employees and 950 employees worldwide in Germany.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said the most important association of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called for the deep-seated links to show "your love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet formation has been disrupted by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said in a big applause.
As a disturbing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government do not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands after a lockdown of the order of the pages of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to "join" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, directed Sand to the movements in which she appeared at a meeting of detractive socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist party for taking the French "believe in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant struggles of the Socialists and said she could not imagine that the new Valls government would continue for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Mrs Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call after a parliamentary resolution and said that she was confident to proceed as a winner in pre-elected elections and be ready for the government.
The ruling party in France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French people believe that the Socialist party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the 2017 period.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and the recordless numbers.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, has been conducting advanced negotiations to acquire the competing prestigious Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its well-being, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end unsuccessfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also holds a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources are asking to remain anonymous, as the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were at $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is in total at about $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position these new customers as the best choice for the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $ 850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise supplier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 per cent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly have the original application documents for the exchange of Prestige Cruises over 82 percent of the passenger capacity for American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group donated the Chinese flag in the vicinity.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted on Sunday a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with pinging faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and induced pro-democracy activists to make their threat and, with "Occupy Central" protests, to break Hong Kong's financial position.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that calls for democracy extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China’s leadership was presented in June over Hong Kong, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the electoral procedure in the special administrative region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city’s business district and organizing a sit-in there.
Lis questioning is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the leadership office.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain saw no democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to take "State talks" with the Ostukraini
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government set up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and enter into direct negotiations with the "stateality" of the secluded region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to empower the Russian-speaking region to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations on eye-highness with the pro-Russian rebels, however, fits the strategy that has been followed since the outbreaks five months ago: assistance for the separatists in the taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to become a reality independent of an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had denied the Ukrainian peninsula Crimean on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area as "Novorossia" or "Neurosland", a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the elections on October 26th and during government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to "get caught in their illusions", reported Itar Tass.
"We need to hold detailed talks immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of the society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to prove the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, should be seen in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker's correction of Putin's "errorion" comments underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, contrary to the direct introduction of Crime, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of the Russians are ethnic.
Moscow would have been much more difficult to deny the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a large majority for the remainder of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats to international forums would empower the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects the Russian territory to crime.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, five months ago, is home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and cast irons, which make important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after a new election - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would allow for greater control over their finances and the status of languages in the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and uprisings Moscow is proposed.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on eye heights followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and Panzers entered the former peaceful region along the Asovski Sea into Ostukraini.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the armchair, which, according to the concerns of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations are being undertaken to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are facing a point where there is no more return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign Panzers are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian Panzer colonies and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donez region last week to support the armed separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers involved in the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian parachutes arrested in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko told them on Sunday.
Neck fotoscandal about Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noblest did not make a hero about his anxiety about hacker, who probably had stolen from his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who of the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking canal are shown around promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker may have over 60 naked photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tributes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle as well as the actor Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, it is likely that private photos were also made public due to an iCloud gap.
The list contains 101 promises.
The most noble man who had committed himself last month to Grecko said against the confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said according to a news page that the hack was "simply" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is located in a pool.
Among the film works are "Love is inaccessible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahowski and the actor Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said about TMZ: "It's an obvious breach of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
Legally, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, jogger and hiker were at the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the Association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, for which one was torture, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the chief of the chief of the station was riding the wheel on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle catheter can be easily hidden there, especially when it has brought him the participation on the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the Association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt).
A great thing.
"Now I know I can do this - fine!"
Small peacocks on the way in the Applaus curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Town Parliament, many of the 718 participants in the early morning came to the mountains and came close to the creation, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good 11 kilometres long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made a little bit more of understatment at the beginning ( "Every lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but at the mountain he proved to be half a professional and went after 45 minutes without breathing through the goal.
He too passed the route in a rutch, as well as Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Obersursel, who had made himself on the way with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here it is Charity, here we are pleased to have - we have made an exit today without a doubt," says the kun.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to the upper room in the morning to immediately shake back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had slipped into the satellite at 9 a.m. to "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Fritten Toni".
For the Chief of the Superintendent of the Cultkiosk, bicycle tours are just over the Feldberg.
He had scored with his 6,5-kilo-rad 40 minutes.
It's a crazy thing.
For this purpose - here I am pleased to do," said Andreas Balzke.
The coached manager says he's an "an ambitious racer."
That's what he has to be, because he was on his way with the "Fixie-Rad", but it's also running wheels, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed up the white wall and the foothill to the top, but also a jogger who pulled a car belt with weights behind on a rope.
Mountainwatch doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said for safety, "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special ski trail, only that he pulls the rail himself." So the man is certainly his own ski dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to the streets in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first riders and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikes were released.
Bent Hansen, president of the Association "Radeln na den Großen Feldberg", gave the starter commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
