Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of wealth to improve the way it works, many people are looking at its solution in a little black box, which is stacked clean on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by motor traffic and transmits that information to the authorities, has been the subject of a controversial effort for the Washington and the State Planning Office to fund the major streets of the United States of America today.
In general, the Hayve Plan has become a topic of deep debate and life bonds, such as routine work.
The government has joined libertarian environmental groups to support the use of these black boxes to provide details of the miles you drive and possibly the location you drive - and then to use this information to prepare tax bill.
Tea party is awesome.
The American Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned by raising issues of confidentiality of different types.
While Congress could not agree on whether to proceed, many Kingdoms are not waiting.
They're looking for how they can go into a system in the next decade to pay for every mile on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
It's really an essential thing for our country.
"It's not about being chosen by us," says Hassan Icharata, who is the executive director of the South California government, who is planning to start every mile set by motorists in California by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay.
It's professional to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Fund has become almost a Diary, which is paid by U.S. citizens on gas pumps.
Americans don't buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more miles in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians are afraid of increasing money in taxes.
Transport policy at Minesota University says, "The gas is not possible."
Their government has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the anti-military payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasonable option in the long run."
The Wonks call it a miles-based user shell.
It is not surprising that this idea seems to be pleasing to urban donors, because it can be changed to make changes in driving as a car, which can help reduce jam and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are looking forward to this system while they are developing strategies to achieve the goals set in the Great Britain's Global Warming Laws.
But the president of the House Transport Committee, rap. Bill Schuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
In the Regen Foundation, free salesmen are also on the side of the driver's payout per mile.
Police chief Adrian Moore said, "This isn't just going to the dark pit."
People are obviously paying more for what they're getting.
The campaign has been supported by two former U.S. transport experts, who in their 2011 report preferred to move forward from Congress towards a counter-mild payment.
U.S. Sinet had approved a 90-million dollar test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing people who have a lot more time to go to work or go to the city, the leadership of Eden ended that proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay the Mileez Salk, instead of gasing the government.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
He's testing with tracks on the limited basis.
And the I-95 cluster, which includes the 17 state transport departments with the former Cibord, including the Meerland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida, are studying how they can act on this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where some time ago 50 free car drivers were fitted with this device, drivers were very eager to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Alouddin Khan, who directs the policy and enforcement regime in the Nevada Transport Section, says, "Big Brothers and other issues of concern have been a major problem."
It's not what people wanted.
In addition to further testing, the A.C.L.U. of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be easy to convert this device to a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, non-manual industrial framework, which has to be unmanaged to keep a record of each person's day-to-day arrival.
Nevada is one of the many countries that are trying to get the same industrialist, with the help of which the government can get a description of how many miles are going every day, but not where and when it is going.
Chen said that if you can do that, people can feel more easily.
This professional's search brought some government agencies to a small California Start-up called Tru Miles.
This form was not in the business of helping drivers by ruling in principle.
It was trying to get into the market standing by the auto disease, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their miles.
But the device that it's testing was very nice to have Haye planners because it doesn't use G.P.S. and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded to the modem at some point in time.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to take this."
These early programs of the Kingdom have had some serious errors.
There are also low-cost and low-cost ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options.
They can choose a device for GPS devices, or without GPS.
Or they can choose no device again, but they can choose to give a set of values based on the average miles determined by the citizens of the Kingdom.
Other places hope that this ban can be lifted by providing less and more facilities in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxiing device that will also provide a payment facility for parking meters, "pay according to your drive" sickness, and create a collection of real-time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor-friendly traffic.
The city plan document states, "The motorists will be attracted to participation because of the benefits they receive from it."
Even so, some transport planners are surprised that the whole discussion on payment according to Miles is perhaps a big distraction.
In the San Francisco Valley area, metropolis transport has said that Congress can increase its gas tax by making it very easy to deal with the problem of the Daily High Trust Fund.
Hybrids or other car drivers can also be fitted with one-time or one-year-olds, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay for their proper share.
Randy Rantseller, head of state and public affairs, said, "When Espirin can work, he needs the basic surgery."
If we do that, millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.

The former Italian prime minister for the Bunga-Bonga parties, 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, has married a 28-year-old girl in such a way as to be free of charge.

The most exciting Indian team that won last match was on Saturday, when it will arrive in the seventh and final forest of Australia in the M Xinswami Stadium.
Because of the rain, India had to win at any time to remain in the Syria after two forests have been washed out, and its bombers had given him a record showing that the team was equivalent to 2-2 in the Syria.
Team India has reached more than 350 targets in the series twice, and once again, it will be the responsibility of the team to move over again.
The Indian Bulbazi is now on the edge and the greatest goal is being set before him.
The grassy shams, spherical dusts, aberrations of Kohli and the moon lions are in a strong form, but the team will also have a special hope for the young lion, suresh rana and the Rvundra Jadja.
As to the question of opening, the team has received a greeting that is making the rest of the protests easier to deal with, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact and as a matter of fact.
In Japur and Nagpur, they had the opportunity to play the game without any pressure, sharing in the opening.
On the third number, Kohli has been widely regarded as the true nature of the future.
In fact, many crickets have given them a better deal than they really did.
Over the next 25 years, there have been 17 centuries of droughts, of which India has won in 16.

Member of the Gazapa National Staff and Chief Prosecutor Dr. Zinandra Sinh said Pakistan is working on a new policy of imprisoning terrorists in the direction of this visible peace.
Referring to the report by the Khufi agencies, the lion continued on Thursday, saying that Pakistan has been working hard to trap nearly 2000 terrorists in its training camps.
For that, he will never be at peace.
Pakistan has been a great deal of trouble since the breakup of the disparate people in Kashmir.
The leader of Pakistani separatists during the past year said that ISIS Chief Lieutenant General Zhehir Ul Islam, the army, the Hizb's successor, had believed that terrorism would be blown in 2014.
Pakistan has taken this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, and of Samba, and of suicide in Hiran, are part of the strategy.

Snow Dane is prepared to "cooperation" with Germany on the American flag
Edward Snow Dan, U.S. Secretary of State, has announced that it is ready to travel to Berlin to prove the evidence in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Strae Belle, met Mr. Snow Den Seguruvar in Russia, where he has been sheltered to talk about the witness in Germany.
Sarsad presented a letter to Berlin on Friday by Mr. Snow Dean, saying, "Although the results of my efforts are quite positive, my government believes that there is a change of heart, and does not provide any protection that seeks to criminalize the political speech with the accused of crime."
Although, speaking the truth isn't a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dean said that they believe that the US government can support the international community against their criminal charges.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been involved in the theft of the property of the hostages and the government.
Hans Peter Frederic, German Minister of Internal Affairs, told the online timer: "We are ready to talk to Mr. Snow Den German authorities, so we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany is under pressure because NSA has claimed to have bugger Angela Marcel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the president of the World Committee, oversees secret information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dun Cossoon as a witness was an opportunity to "break up relations with America completely and not bring them into danger," it should also be taken.
Mr. Belle, a member of the Green Party in Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He said that two German journalists were on their trip to Russia.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the pre-NSA prosecutor, if they left Russia, Snow Den Russians are not able to return.
If Snow Dan witnessed in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, Sarsad said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter, "They had to face terrible and persistent efforts" forced them to leave home.
Although he said that the world is happy and proud by global responses to his work of royal expression.
Together with the United States - with the world's citizens, the high authorities also estimate the mystery of a vast public service overseer of an unresponsible system.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Cari - On Baggez will land
The Frontier Airlines plan to charge $100 for travel on your flight board.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start a charge for $100 for a car - on-bag and this will put $2 for coffee or solstice, although the Wednesday announced that travellers can keep a complete breakdown.
The new car - on-the-ball overhead is for the bag, so, the small bag below the seat is still no: to be checked.
Frontier said that it would charge $25 if paid in AIDS, would have to wait $100 if they would wait to pay for the trip while they're on the gate.
Frontier's teacher Kate O'Malley said he had to get to care for the charges in $100 bill of travel.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines launched a charge for the first and second check baggage in 2008.
Those who are trying to escape the traffic are filling out as much as they can in Carrie - On Baggage as is in the overhead debbe, meaning this debbe is often less space.
There is one way to reduce travel on the chess board.
O'Malley said it wasn't really about adding new cargo money.
This is for the most loyal customers about Frontier that it's hard to find the top without.
This should not be allowed to allow incoming customers to buy tickets on their websites.
This means that the next person in the line can pay $100 for the same bag, while on a frontier gate they can get a traveler in the line, a bag free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and checks are changing their processes before getting the gate to make sure that the travelers know about the fiss.
Frontier's new Carey-on-Fiss won't start until the heat is set even if a date is not set.
Travelers often show dissatisfaction with luggage and other items, but the air service prefers them.
They argue that money is needed to manage the luggage, and those who want travel services should pay for it.
The Bagge's face on Wall Street is seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after many years of loss.
Most of them don't even have a cary-on-bag bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began the first three years ago with Carey-on-ball, and the partner dissident Allegiant Air later.
With one of them, Wizz Air is another airline in Hungary, which is said to be an airline consultant for Sorensen, and who is tracking Add - On Fish.
He said the Spirit's career - on pay brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, an ex-prisoner of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the Spirit and the travelers had to face an unusual bag of fish on the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my Airlines career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to see a toothbrush and a battle gate out.
"It was raining and they said it was licky-split."
Frontier's also tracking coffee, tea, dessert, or 2 cents of Spirit for Juice.
Frontier's nice that anyone who leaves, or takes Jus, can keep all the debs, and this free coffee will only be given for once.
It'll still drain the water.
In 2008, they tried to charge for drinking, but seven months after the travel complaint, they withdrew and followed any other main airline.
If the travelers of Frontier's do not buy directly from the airline, this step of Frontier's efforts to run its customers against its own website to charge on Carey-On.
Airlines pays online travel sales to Orbitz for each ticket of $10 to $25.
That's why all the airlines have been encouraged to operate travels to buy them directly from an online travel agency rather than going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has gone ahead in this area.
In September, many frequent flights began to spend half the distance of miles for customers who had purchased an online travel agency from these people.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mile of the trip to 25 percent of the mile.
Thus, a 1,000 - mile [1,000 - mile] Frontier Trip 250 - mile [250 - mile] distance purchased from an online travel agency will be required.
It is also that they allow Frontier to select its seat in Agrim only on purchase directly from the website.
There's a loyal client base in his home city at Frontier's Denver, but it's getting less trade and it's losing money.
The decline of 9 percent in the government and its flying capacity has declined in the first three months, according to the financial results of the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
They're trying to set Frontier's money as part of the sales of the Republican Airlines.
N.S. has charged hackers instead of "internal error" to get website crash
Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours, not for hackers, as some people have claimed online.
Khufia Agency said in an e-mail address, "NSA.gov was not at night for several hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-defined update."
The problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that this obstacle was caused by the widespread denial of service [D.D.S.] because of the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the website of the NSA was closed for at least six hours, and that the site is not yet available for some users.
N.S.A. spokesperson told the A.B.C. News that the Agency's internal, sensitive network was not "even" shared.
The teacher said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one octivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of the N.S.A. through the D.D.S. attack.
The D-D.O.S. attack is designed to increase traffic on target websites until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This is an unexpected cyber strategy and the target of attacks does not differ from the internal network of the target system.
Formerly extremely secretive N.S.A., which has ever been called "This No Agency", has been the subject of discussion and discussion among the general public since the events of foreign and domestic jazz events in recent months - which was previously reportedly banned by N.S.A., the contributor Edward Snowden, after the release of files from the Agency and the release of the Library.
As a result of this growing debate on the Agency, such arrests have been made after the night's event that this event was the result of a marked cyber operation.
A fine expression was presented according to the statement of 'one and one' in the context of the times and conditions of the day.
It has been shown that in today's survey, a teacher is forced to walk in the wrong way.
The performance was celebrated by St. Joseph Inter College's chairman, Prime Minister Walmiki, Prime Minister of Defence of the camp, Naresh Consul, and the power of the lion.
The violence of the Deaper Age in the theater and the present situation of a professor in Arvind had been demonstrated.
In an inhaled Sharma concert, India's violent Sharma, inhaled Sharma, Winod Bechan, Heminth Goil, border Samir, tribal Thursday, Abid Sami, Shiva Gazala, Ameth, Ramesh, Arjun and Andi presented a great deal of trial with the carers.
The light system in the theater was made by the Design of the Royal and Set's Young Colorful Bientry.
In addition to this, various awards have been awarded to cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, and cultural elements.
It was given to the king by the Urd division of the lion, D. D. Realm Zemsedpuri, the top writer of Shnunath Shokla, and the colourful animal C.

The Canadian Air Force and Train Meker Bombardier Inc informed Thursday of a 15 percent decrease in net profits, in its third trimester in the railway unit and the lower the amount of air pressure on the points.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also presented no flight test data for his brand new CSeries flight to complete his important program of going to the social service from release or flight the next September.
Almost a month before the first flight of the test plane, it was only three times, the question is whether or not the test phase is on the track.
The result is lower than expected and has been sent to the Sharer Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent slideshows.
Cameroon Dorson, with the National Bank Finenschiel, a analyst shares his rating for "the field display" on Thursday is limited to one or two weeks.
"The best airlines were expecting the most, we are clearly disappointed in the transport display," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new command for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight test program.
Although, if no new commands are announced in coming months, the market program will probably be assured.
Bombardier is expected to be able to adapt it at least at the end of the commercial market in Boing and Eerbus.
The first flight test was unveiled in March and was launched for the first time in September after the month.
The potential Croatian New Zetliner waits for a flight test to accept the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential cost survival, but such as the fixed order for CSeries to 177.
There are 403 complete orders and resistance available with 15 customers and operators.
The chief official Pierre Bodoin believed Bombardier would meet his 300-form order target from the time he first used the jet.
Authorities assured analysts and Thursday that the program was running according to the index.
"The test plane was on the ground for a long time," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground test and software update interval.
Every creator makes a different pattern.
We've decided to fly a first flight and an update period and said what we did.
That's why the flight program will be all over.
The second part of the five-test flights with the following, expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.
Yet, analysts believe that customers are doubting that they can start a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in 12 months.
Bombardier said that this entry was evaluated for service index (EIS) and will provide an update in the next few months.
"It's a slow pace of flight testing -- although with Bombardier's internal index in line -- to confirm our opinion that access to the service will be interrupted in Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or per sharer 8 cent, $172 million, or per sharer 9 cent.
Arranged by each sharer on the 9th cents.
The state is $4.2 billion from $4.1 billion.

"Erospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the situation of the market combined with the following order and the overall situation of the market was a disappointment," Bodoin said.
The Eurospace government has a drop of 13 percent in $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, in the division, had about 11 per cent of the government's dollar.1 billion.
In the transport unit, the order was backloging $32.6 billion, about 30 September, from the top of the case on December 31.
There were also some large facilities in the transport area affected by execution points.
The officials said that the new guidelines would be given in the fourth quarter.

The new research has shown that we work with all honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone, to steal, or to deceive,
But in the evening, we change our mind and we start acting against the law on the one hand.
The researchers in this survey of Harvard University and Utto's David Only School of Business have given a number of disturbing facts.
According to the research, we prefer moral values, without stress in the morning, but in the evening, it is due to fatigue or more pressure.
The research used two for it.
They told some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people were told that the point is more on the left or on the right.
Those who participated were told that if they answered the wrong answer instead of the right, they would be given money.
This experiment showed that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
That's where it was found when people were used between noon and 6:00 p.m. to keep their principles in mind and answer the wrong way.
As a result, the resources have succeeded in proving that the desire for money in the morning does not make a difference in our honesty, but in the evening we stop providing morals.
This research is published in the latest issue of the Psychological Science.

Mr. Bigg, the chief of police, who has been reporting on the police investigation.
42 - year - old Bashata was telling the criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The governor thought that his secret drug could be known to people.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison
The chief of the guard, who told Mr. Big about the police investigation, because he was afraid of his treatment, will be known to the public about his secret medical condition for three years.
After a 42-year-old ditta had been exposed to his cocaine leak, the criminal Neal Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about the examination of his na√Øve drug-scarrying activities.
The prosecutor, who was named "Bash", and whose crimes were praised as "top briefing", was arrested by police guards in Scarboro after his home in 2011, which he had represented in the last Narcotics Trail.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarboro in Blackburn, Lukashier, holding three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer, while he went out with his colleagues to the Los Angeles diner.
After receiving cocaine in his credit card, the teeth of his hair, his shoes, and his credit card showed that the teeth of category A were "regular users".
During the eight months between August 2011 and January 2011, he attempted to obtain incorrect information about the arrest of two people by Scarboro and his associate.
Lukashier, Cumbria, Mercesid, Berkhshier and West Yorkshire were then being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of the Heroin and Coconut Group.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison after a total of 1.5 million pounds of price, heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds.
Forty-two years old was informing the criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine flow.
The state law of the Forbes Solicitors in the Blackbank, which was operating in the state law firm, was facing a failure in the Liverpool Crown Court three weeks after the trial of the trial in two cases.
He had agreed to keep cocaine in the hearing before.
The bad time for the lawyer began when the police found out that he had regularly been on the phone with the dentist since February 2011.
Two geese followed the insect and saw it coming into the house of the dentist and holding more than 60 percent of the lawyer's clearance than in Black Golf Gloves.
After the Nazi treatment, Scarboro was regularly on the phone, which had gone out for dinner in the BlackRovers Football Stadium, Evod Park.
And it came to pass, when the judge had come home, that he found out that there was a cure there, and that there was a conversation among them about it nine times.
The court heard that he had found a "regular user" of cocaine in an A-category examination of teeth, buttocks and credit cards.
Datta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the infected dealer because he was his client and said that their discussion was about "medical privileges".
During his arrest, Dita pulled out her wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but they had been arrested, and her hair was taken as a model.
In police testimony, he said he was running office with his place-of-work and calling his client's home for medical matters.
After telling the chief prisoners what Joshua knew about them, the court heard that the dentist was calling people of the main supply chain, some of which he had previously introduced.
On the side of the accession, Annie White said: "The former author should be best known not to break the law."
As an offender on Mr. Dent, he is charged with using his position to connect much more to his specific client.
We're not talking about a general drug dealer, we're not talking about a dealer who's giving his lawyer a drug.
Their talk shall be without doubt: for he was a judge.
But he went further than his limit of the lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible, he forced the police to remain able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dent, not the honor of your business, but the insulting.
He made more close to some certain clients, especially Scarboro, and he allowed his freedom to be understood.
Datta denied any wrongs and claimed: "If I'm a bad lawyer, I'm not, and if I want to inform Mr. Scarboro, I don't wait for 15 hours, but I'm doing it right away.
But after hearing, Lingashier Police Superintendent Lee Hallstead said: "When Mr. Datta began to get a cure from organized criminals, they turned themselves into a criminal from an offender."
They took too much credit for their cocaine leak and became much weaker for the aims of the members of the organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information about the police investigation.
The leaders must maintain the highest standard of faithfulness, and have faith and self-confidence in people.
Mr. Datta has been deceived by this belief and has tried to save his life.
The Lukashier's serious and organized crime unit examined Mr. Dent, in which three cases were found to be guilty of holding them in cocaine, and now to block the path of justice, which demonstrates our resistance to bringing criminals to justice.
This matter should be a warning to the guilty, that no man is far from the coming of the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years after being convicted of offering heroin, cocaine and wheat.
Fifty other members of the group were sent to Karavas for a total of 153 years for Nazi drug offences.
Detta gave her questions and answers on her website, in which she said she would become a lawyer for the death penalty client in the United States, to be their diner guest, and to be motivated by their incompatibility for their work.

For two weeks, the conflict between government forces and Rey Namo has been reported almost daily, more than 20 years after a peace settlement.
Renomo was once a part of the country's efforts to disrupt free government in the beginning, after which there was a vicious violation of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the colouring of the South African government.

Tenth anniversary of the New York Commodity Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that the New York City is the birthplace of the Standup comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, Hashi filmmaker Frank Fe, who worked as a festival teacher in Bradwe, began to hear a direct conversation with the people sitting in the crowd.
Fa's search has been extended over the years, most recently, in the New York Comedy Fostival.

Nick Kroll, a D-Qable Sitcom (F.X.X.) from Ronchi Fantaci-Football theme called "The League", and now has their own comedy central chess show.
Jenny Slate is a member of "Satarde Night Live" and "Parks and Recruitment", although they are best known for their Voiral Video series "Marsil Da Shell Wid Shuez On."

The court has forbidden action against the New York Police Department on the break and the cricket policy
On Thursday, a Joint Appeals Court required a judge's order to suspend the New York Police Department and remove the judge from the case.
The U.S. Circuit Cort. 2 And judge Shira Shindler said that the judge's decision would be based on an appeal through the city.
In the judicial city, they had heard a violation of the Constitution in August of the banning and questioning of the people.
The city's police department has also decided to enlarge a supervisor to help with its policy and related training programs, its conclusion and its medical order.
The Court of Appeal heard the charges against the defendant on the trip.
The Court of Appeal has said that since it interpreted the need for a judge to avoid the presence of a class of media witnesses in order to avoid the presence of partiality and that it should be held publicly responsible to investigate the case of the judge.
The judge dismissed the decision that the police misbehaved with its pause and the cricket program, pointing to black and Spanish men who violated the civil rights of thousands of people.
He has set up an external monitor to monitor a major change in grades, training and surveillance with financial improvements, and he is the most closed where in some areas a pilot program has been ordered to test the body's clothing cameras.
In August, New York City agreed to complete the custom of storing people's names and addresses after a police arrest.
The city's appeal refers to a oral argument for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play device has been analyzed with civil rights authors.
The pause and the cricket policy has been in some form around the decades, but most black and Spanish men, 684330 to 2011, have been marked by a dramatic increase under the administration of Free Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A trial of four men was conducted by all the smallest figures in 2004, and a class action became the case.
The support for change in NYPD's pause and play program has said that inappropriate behavior will end with a more reliable and powerful police force boosting and may influence the use of police in other police departments.

The judge has noted that there was no end to the pause and the cricket, which is legit, but had improved the operation of NYPD's stop.
Many of the participants in the training were Goddess, priests, princes, rich men, and captains of thousands and of tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of several students, including Tent Pitching, Flag Pole.
Dr. Assuptous Virgin Rey and Jesus are being trained in the field of education.
All religions are sharing the feelings of unity, including in prayer.
Civil chief Vplin Kumar is providing their special support in the training of the state.
Collins used phone hacking to confirm secret information
The former editor of the News of the World has been charged with using "Phone hacking, surveillance, and Amman-Samana" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret relationship with Charles Clark's house.
Actor Andrew Eds Q.C. told Old Bally that News of the World had heard a misdemeanour in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "agreed special advisor" Hannah Polby.
The court said that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Malcolm to hack the Polish Voisemel and to "keep watch", but Colson also called and left his Voisemel.
Mr. Addis said, "The proponent suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside the people's home and watch them, but they have articles with people, see how people react to him."
They said that N.T.D.Blu used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and amena-samana.
The third was the editor themselves.
Obviously, he knew other ways, namely, surveillance, he certainly knew.
What about first - century Christians?
Did he know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they did."
The author's desk of the U.T.D.Blu had first presented the affidavit about Clark's alleged relationship, when a popular source in Sussari Polby said, "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, at least three times the tape of Voysemel from the home of the Sussari Polby phone from the home.
Researchers also found entries in the personal investigator's computer that called Sushi Polby and their sister "Project".
During the time they were being examined, they were called by Sussir Polby's grandfather and asked for information about them.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Neville Steurlback and former Reporter James Wenderup saw the surveillance of the arrival of S√ºhrer Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a vacuum, "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'm sure I'm going to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that the involvement of Colson in this case is in the other important parties, such as the former house-scene David Blancet.
The judge told the governor that Colson had talked to Mr. Blancett about the relationship with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the issue of co-terrorist Rebecca Brooks who were married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to associate with others to phone between 3 October 200 and 9 August 2006.

On a quiet day in August, a German police officer in Helicopter Germany took a look at the U.S. commercial entity at the financial capital of Frankfurt.
Under the direction of the Office (BfV), the German Home Agency, the mission was to take a picture of the cover of the United States, which is less than 5 minutes from the European Central Bank and the Foundation.
The German media told BfV to express hope of identifying the presence of the Licensing Antenna and signaled an exchange of action between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Clipper, director of the U.S. National Holy See, stressed that America has the potential to steal the trade secrets of its foreign secret companies and to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their line below." Then do not use them in September.
But since Edward Snowon, a poet who has become a bisblover, began to tell the U.S. treasure of his secrets, the leaders of the European government and the business world are no longer certain that the director is not going to keep his word.
As told by the U.S. National Security Agency, Brazil‚Äôs oil company Petrobras, and our broadcasters Google and Yahu, and Yahu were afraid of a fearsome government overseer.
The last thing came when it became clear that Chancellor Angela Marcel had been on the phone, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be noted, trade world leaders are definitely also targeting potential targets.
Snodon has made significant cooperation between the United States‚Äô secret services and companies transparent.
I feel that it would be useful to use these data for the mutual benefit of others.
"German must wake up," says Oliver Gr√ºn, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German companies, the United States has now become almost too busy, like China, when it comes to industrial fraud and data theft.
In all the documentation, Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that America has gone to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union, and it should strive to reduce its dependence on America.
Business world leaders are doubting it.
Someone in Germany said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is no way,"
If a strong European IT industry wanted it, it would not have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
There's everything in Germany, from Koyle, to the car, to the crew.
But the IT industry is everything.
The US's technical approval and geosusception has proved to be a major threat to certain companies, which were openly exposed by Snowden to the U.S. industry.
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing area where the European authorities are more careful that data stored in the United States is subject to that authority and are therefore likely to become sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by a trade agency, some 10-person non-American members cancelled the plan to use a US-based cloud supply after the release of Data Przym Crime Program.
Jim Snabe, chief officials with SAP, say: "We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago ‚Äì that is - my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that area?"
Many German authorities argue that the latest report just confirmed that the powerful government wants to steal their most secure secrets and data and therefore should be careful at all costs.
That's not a miracle that's economic sense.
It's always coming.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, the chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
The United States is looking after us at the economic and industrial level, and we are doing it, because it's in national favour for the protection of our business.
Corporate leaders generally do not want to protect the system and this is a benefit for the attack.
For large companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, although it is unclear whether to leave one in business from home by taking usb stick, or a laptop without leaving in a hotel's room at least to say.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a car manufacturer, says board members say it's an old system for collecting mobile phones before board meetings, as their use could not be as remote hearing devices.
Germany's BfV staff are advised to consider using a simple pre-paid mobile when using smart phone abroad.
The prepaid mobile phone was subsequently dropped.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring this is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it's in a number of companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often have a lack of experience, workers and financial resources to protect the corporate secret effectively against unauthorised access," BfV warns in a report.
America has warned about its own companies' financial jesus by other countries.
According to France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. National Chufiya in February with Russia and Israel, which is called after China's financial information, is in another series of related crimes in hacking.
According to a German blue chip company board member when it comes to making money, "French is the worst.
Bernard Squarcini French Interior Secret Agency DCRI, former head of the witness, says: "Services well know that all countries are united in a non-ethnic war, and are looking after their partners."

The parents of Georgia's young man who was killed in a "unique accident" believe that his son was killed
A young man in Georgia whose dead body had been found trapped in a restaurant mat in his high school school, believed that their son had been killed, the family leader said to Thursday.
Valdosta, K.K. Kendrick Johnson was arrested directly in a standing mat behind his high school gym in Blychus on 11 January.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in a 'unique' accident, but the family of 17-year-old boys refused it.
Keneth and Jaklin Johnson, the president of Benjamin Rape, told Fox News Dot Com, "They believe that their son has been killed completely."
The way they're told by Sheriff doesn't exactly trust death.
Rape said, "They believe that this is a matter of physical law and common sense."
They believe that this conclusion is a defense for the death of their son or for the protection of the people.
They said, "They sent their son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a Buddhist bag."
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Muller told Thursday that he was testing a medical examination of Johnson's death, as many important questions were answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder caused by a crime?
Mori spoke these words to Thursday at a newspaper conference in the afternoon.
I'll follow the facts. They'll take us wherever we go.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the fore.
They said, "I think there is an environment in which to test."
Mure told the reporter that the initial shoal test showed that Johnson's death resulted from "stately shoals".
According to the wall, a second saw found a different cause of death in the test."
They said, ‚ÄúThere are many questions that must be answered or confirmed.‚Äù
Mure also said that if he finds enough witnesses to prosecute or examine civil rights in Johnson's death case, he will ask the FBI to do so.
A representative from the London County Sheriff's office was not immediately available for comment when contacting Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the officers to release all the surveillance videos considered by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they're hoping to get some evidence of how his death occurred.
C.C. ran the children's allergy-related directional instructions for schools
On Wednesday, disease control and prevention center issued instructions to control children's food allergies at school.
For the first time, the U.S. government has issued such guidelines, as the number of children attending school is increasing.
Now one child in every 20 in the U.S. has food allergy.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, children had increased by 18 percent in food allergy cases.
This direction informs students how teachers and workers should be informed about the food allergy of children, and how to handle it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students have also been suggested that they store the stock of Epinephrine to deal with potentially fatal tergrasty (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-engineering of the Eppen Brand, which is most commonly used.
The Royal Assembly has recently updated the rules, which enables students to keep the stock of epinaphrine more easily.
This report also contains a list of common symptoms reported by children affected by the allergic reaction.
Children can say, "Something seems to sound in my tongue," "My tongue seems to have hair," or, "My tongue is shaking."
Parents and children of Intersex kids can choose 'undefined line' for their children
Germany has become the first European Union country that has approved the third chain for children born with indiscriminate genital mutilation.
The newborns will no longer be identified as male or female.
In accordance with the new law, parents do not need to announce a ring for such children, this law allows them to declare a ring "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on the parents who can make decisions about ling-specificity for the newborn child, and to fight prejudice against the inter-sex children.
According to the B.B.C., an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a painkiller, made by doctors.
According to the estimates, there is a child of two thousand each year who has neither son nor daughter.
They're intersex, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which comes under the control of sexual development disorders, this common word used for unusual features, genetics (indignities or enlargement), or unusually developed links.
Wales sympsion may be intersexing.
The Ling identification is not yet understood correctly, but most experts in United States believe that when the Ling cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to specify the Ling and to check, if such a change occurs, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before it comes.
Psychological Dr. Jack Drassesser of New York City, who is experts in the case of Ling-Phahan, said the new German law "seems to be good."
Inter-sex children create moral inconsistencies.
They said, "Some people are in a state of life that requires self-restraint, but most of them do not have children."
You can specify only a string without a sequence, and then see how the identity is developed.
The science of knowing how to develop a line in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this is happening.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In 2011, the report submitted by the European Commission describes intersexuals as being different from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not related to string but related to their vital design, which is neither clearly male nor female but is either combined or is not clearly defined either.
These features can show themselves a secondary sexual preference, such as the weight of the muscles, the distribution of the hair, the breast and the length; primary sexual preference, such as reproductive limbs and genital mutilation; or characteristic composition and hormone.
The report also provides insight into the prejudices faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of workers, as well as violence, violence and respect for crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-legging boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark older persons on their official documents on men, women or "third-line".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Valby became the first certified "Lingine" in the world after winning the "unspecified" chain for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will also be a third specification for M or F intersex persons in German passports as X.
According to the news report on France 24, the neighbouring country still has issues related to the link in France.
In 2011, French legislators signed or signed letters from this strictly Catholic country to return to the "Ling Principles" from the books of the school.
The website of the U.S. Catholic Online also opposes this German law, saying, "While the world is going in a state where the ring itself is chosen, but John is not acting, we are taking two other columns in the opposite direction of the universe."
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn child also told Baby John that she would like to see the children be assigned a ring when they were born.
He said on the website, "Trueness without limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's ring is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, men and women were called the children born with both genders Hermaphrodites, which was named after the beautiful Greek goddess, the twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the chain to be a slat that could be deleted and then written.
But now many people are challenging the morale of self-sacrifice, they understand that the chain is complex, and sometimes even with doctors, who don't know what they'll feel about their chain specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Monorog" tomorrow.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the mentals, you called the sly-chicks.
The current principle on treatment of indiscriminate genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Mani of John Hapkins University, who considered the ring to be insurmountable.
They gave the word "ling identification" and argued how social and environmental signs raise the child - parents - interact with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", their principles became debated.
They advised a child whose parents had been accident-laughing during the langagrachram-purchasing (Circamsession) to complete the child's sentence and to release him as a red-haired girl.
The Dresser said: "Manny has presented the matter as a matter of success, but it has not happened."
At the age of 15, the child returned as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he killed himself.
Dresser said some doctors are still "observing the same resistance".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the people who are passing through this chain of silence began to face "not happy with the outcome".
This was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.Vai. male qualities, but his genealogy was unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his chain was small, or his godship was large, but they were sure that he could never live as a man's "satisfied life".
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, he was excavated from the outside of Bruce's arms and chest of drawers, and became his adult girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
In his 18th year, he was going to be a Veginoplasty with him.
But feeling unwell and some confusion, he asked for medical records.
This made him aware of the terrible truth.
I was bound when I was born - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, which caused his genetics to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man, he took the testosterone food and removed his ashes.
She got hooked up because of shel-chickets.
Today, he explains to people to make their opinion normal about the intersexuals in the Interface Project organization.
However, California-based media group Advockets for Infomed Switzerland's executive director Ani Tamer-Matis is concerned that Germany's law "is inviting chipi and kalak."
They say, "Many activists think that the German law will prompt the parents to make quick decisions and the child to specify "unspecified."
We are afraid that this will encourage action.
We think it's best to specify a male or a female ring instead of waiting.
But we don't know how the law will play, so we can only expect.
Tamar-Matis said their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows the elderly to be recognized in the third line."
They said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decisions about the media."
The law of Germany relates to specifying the time of birth.
It's not a war by the nine children at the time.
As they grow up, they can make decisions about their bodies themselves.
But Pittsburgh's column radiologist Dr. Erlin Bartz, who has a daughter who has a development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give both parents and children power."
The daughter of Baratz had been born with qualities, but she had a full androgenic history called D.S.D.
Since his androgen was guilty in the farm, women's preferences developed in Katy.
His body is Jonah, but there is no pregnancy or debauchery.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resident at the University of Pennsylvania in the Child Psychology Department.
Although she's a band, she expects to be a mother through well-being or hospitality.
He said, ‚ÄúThis is a law that allows parents to make their own decisions without delay.‚Äù
It provides them with the right understanding and time by some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to do a slump in a hurry that can't be returned.
They said, "He brings the children to judgement and frees the parents from hardship because they do not believe that they are doing good."
Finally, the child will determine which line she's easier with -- and it'll be a very good thing.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
The Cheerman and the All-Jeez Sandap Kohor, chaired by the Thasil Legal Vice-Chairman Committee of Ramangar, was organized in the Middle School of Ramangar.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the authority of education and economically for those behind them.
Edvocket Emil Kupta, Rohan India, and Sarpach, in the camp, alerted the people as they spoke about the matter.
A large number of residents were present in the program.
Report: Consider the biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Client.
According to New York Times, President Barak Obama‚Äôs close advisers secretly considered Hillary Clients ‚Äô ticket for 2012 by Deputy Prime Minister Kelley Beden.
The most remarkable threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Helman expected 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the game 2012."
Timers received an answer from the following book and Thursday evening told the president's top advisors what could help the Obama to find out in the hope of re-election of the polling biden to organize "wide-ranging group sessions and late 2011".
According to Time‚Äôs National Political Dialogueist Jonathan Martin, the book explains the full information of efforts made by the chief officials and calls the White House, the head of the East House staff, to know what changes the Whispering President of the former State has had to do with Poland.
The possible switch was a very secure secret within the basic roofs of the Jaguago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half of the president's closest advisors ‚Äì including the president ‚Äì were aware of changes in East Obama's campaign, Chief Jim Massina, and East White House's top consultants, David Axlerod and David Puluffe.
"Dublin" claims that the Paste tried to change Biden in spite of their personal ties at the end of their decision as they were informing them that there would be no improvement in Obama's situation from the client's ticket.
In a witness with Martin, Drage has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the location of Clinton with Beden.
"I told the whole view, and one of them put it, it was," said the news letter.
Remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were at a stage like this, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While Date told the research as "warning", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made an important contribution to finding what it would be worth if Paul was.
"Like campaign money don't spend attention on focused groups until they're seriously thinking about something," Martin said on AC360.
It's inexplicable, now, whether Obama knew their team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if they knew about the possible change in the boss?
While he said they didn't think the president knew about the possible change," former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" is not going to answer: did the political check come to Obama's desk? Martin told me.
Cooper asked Martin if they knew about the serious investigation of Obama biden dumping tickets.
"Probably," said Martin.
Is Glo-in-Dark Ice Cream favorite?
A British author used the world's first Glo-in-Dark Ice Cream - Zelfish.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of many marine animals to develop a better destruction.
He came up with this idea after reading a search letter on Zelyfish, and China's confident scientists used chemical light to re-emerge the protein.
This cream, which the eaters will respond to with the language, will increase the protein's fifth level and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says the icecream is excited with a warm response to the mouth, which means it's going to be more ghastly, it's going to be so brighter.
Lick, the founder of M Delicius Izcram, Charlie, said: "This is incredible, but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from ¬£200."
The protein that we're using in Iscream will react with a neutral PCH in the language.
As the face warms, the protein pash will increase and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing it for the past few months and it seems right to share it with Halloween because it's a wonderful light.
It's probably the most important ice cream that's made of mannequins because the gilded gold is four times as high as the gilded gold.
The cost of each cup comes to me about 140 pounds.
Although it's so good.
Charley's commercial company, based in Bristol, is famous for apne unusual flavor, with beer, pier, meat and gold card.
But his next design is going to be more important.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make the iscram infractions, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice Cream is used as a duplicate of a geologic characteristic, which has been analyzed by Chinese scientists
The whole market was cut off by customers in the Queen's garden of March.
The last thing was that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy a ticket.

When I was a kid, Halloween was a magician.
My sister and I were allowed to play for the next neighbor to eat, sleep, and play.
Today, I'm more than a greedy man.
I didn't even sign this for the last two years in order to release the candidature from my apartment, and it probably won't be this year.
But the figures indicate that I'm a black sheep when Halloween came.
According to the National Rittle Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million on Halloween this time.

There's no harm in my understanding.
Last year, we were not alone in clothes and surprises.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million for the earthly clothing.
It's the same joke that many hotdogs are with a dog.
We wouldn't have seen it around when it came to Kandiki.
According to the Nilsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The annual bars, Lolipop, Milc Dads, Twislers, and Clark Bars are about 600 million pounds [600 million kg].
According to the U.S. Department of Social Affairs, it is a good news that 41 million trucks will take part in our neighbours.
But actually, we're going to buy what we're doing, and what we're doing is going to buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
We will not use anything according to the Confectioners Association during Halloween, but it will also pay about 35 million pounds.
It's about Macca's personal breakdown of 9 billion.
It's a secret.
There's nothing more than a reasonable Hollywood ghost house.
They're the best name, "tangs behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "choch-o-choch" and were like "House of Shock."

In the end, they speak of spells.
Charlie Brown presented the great caddo when we were kids and a Jack-O-Latten map is like a Christmas tree -- that's what we've done since we were little.
For us, it was, "Baby, these apakkin trains" that started last year because of the Pinterest, so most of us are older than these guards and don't have a fight with them.
According to the U.S. census, this year, the U.S. will spend around $106 million.

Transport Aria did not dream of trading in a floating market.
Pakcha merchants have been trapped in the fungus after the order of Heicourt.
Neither can they trade in the temporary parcels created at Reggat Avenue now, nor have they been issued a license to trade in Transport Aria.
Penjab and Harjana Heicourt, a joint commission, announced the temporary flagship market during their tour.
Because there was no proper provision, the death penalty was ten million dollars.
Heicourt, in his order, has called into question the administrative authorities of the Mortars, saying that the task of an administration that has not been able to solve a problem for nine years has not been resolved.
They could not be found in the right location in the city.
The shipowners were then asked to issue a license for the business in the shipping state market, providing adequate security.
After the order, the merchants were pleased, but the police turned the water on their joys on Friday.
The real license brand's team came to the market and placed a counter on it and sold the form.
What they were told after that was impossible for them to meet in one day.
The SCP East Grav Gorg, a member of the License Branch, arrived at the SCHO SultanWind Golden Shamka Patak Market.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the trades.
Therefore, no licence has been issued for the potato business.

After a nine-month-old cook had been separated on Sunday afternoon from a street corner and three days before the Wednesday was delivered from the farm.
Their master Scott Elderson, 25, and their girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were in the flappy desert in the West Yorkshire, and they have blessed the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After a small accident, they had been looking for their lost dog like madmen, and had been posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday afternoon at 2.15 p.m., a fast - looking dock Walker saw Ruby on the mountain at the height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Klekheton Fire Station came to the event site and came down by Russia to save Ruby and used a pet tube to bring him down from the rock.
Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said, "It was in a dire situation.
It was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He didn't do anything during his rescue; he was a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating cookies.
It was a very unusual aid call.
But it's incredible to see the dog.
Special Technical Protection Officer Peter Lo said, "Ruby has survived in a positive way."
It was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse situation.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor for testing, where she was found better than fatigue and isolation.
Halifax, from West Yorkshire, Miss Hall said, "It was terrible to see the maintenance work."
At first I didn't believe how she got there.
He's amazing to get back in his hands.
The animal doctor said that if she became very tired and fell, she would certainly fall down.
The fire department did much better.
What they did is really very encouraging.
We are grateful to them, and they were all better.
From Kigli, Mr. Elderson also said, "We were afraid she might fall, but she was there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mike Jaeger says that when Katy Perry was 18 years old, they didn't attack her.
This week, during a witness with an Australian radio show, Pon Star said they were singing back vocals for the 2004 song "Old Habits Day Hard".
Perry said they had dined with the Supreme Rocker, and "When I was 18, they attacked me."
They said, ‚ÄúThis is an old age, and they are treating me with kindness.‚Äù
The 70-year-old representative of Jagar said in a statement to Thursday that he "never clearly refuses to rush on Katy Pari."
The representative also said, "Perhaps Pari is talking about them in another person's misunderstandings."
Pari this year was one of the guitars coming as a guest on the Rolling Stone Tower.
Their new album "Prizzm" reached the top of this week.
George Kerven: Euro Agent gave Scotts an option
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that free Scotland will need to be included as a free travel area throughout Europe as a condition for EU membership.
The passport controls on Bervik and the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the limit of the contilla star.
It is true that Strathclid Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, even though it was not described in - predicted - headslines.
No one described that the U.S. members spend most of their time changing their professional rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer an area of housing, Brussels will actually be free of permanent non-exploitation for Brussels instead of receiving anything from Scotland.
That's why, then, un-kani.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has come together, and I first heard the "freedom means passport control" of the Habunian newspaper about 40 years ago.
Yet the stoutness of the old tale is perished.
Why should we expect to build Europe from free Scotland?
Why would the London Joke be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's biggest, war-after-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has been officially dead.
The groups dedicated to closing Euros in U.S. to oppose the U.S. or to stop Euros as the same currency.
Even in Germany, Euroscaptile Alternetiv Fork Germany -- which was set up this year -- suddenly received about five million votes in the September election, and thus effectively expelled Free Democrats from the Bundestag.
There is always a domestic opposition to the plan to build the Union's Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be the original variable.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the European project has gone far away because of the obstacles imposed on national economic systems.
There was not much role to be played by Euro in the excessive budget loss of national governments - that was true only in the case of Greece.
On the contrary, the Euro system has established its members on behalf of German exporters the exchange rate - things that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a home currency valuation, South Europe finds itself in an inherently damaging situation in comparison with Germany.
The only solution is to reduce the violence and public affairs -- which was encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European producer of money and budget problems somewhere ahead of the current budget.
In order to release French and German energy companies under user rule - as a result of the "silver" energy prices imposed by Brussels, European industry pays four times for electricity and gas compared to the United Nations.
It's a percussion cost damage that we've seen before in Grandmouth.
Even if all proteins are frozen in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry cannot avoid being influenced by U.S. Shell Gas.
As a result, there is a growing sense of violence among people, especially in France, which has been praised by the U.S. chief.
After the war, the top politicians of France saw the E.U. control Germany, and Paris as a plan to provide a billing equivalent to that of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is causing the French economy to collapse.
As a result: Marie Lee Pene's southern capital, the U.S. opposition National Front has won a third-place ruling socialist in the recent subordination.
At the time, France is the most popular group with 24 percent voting -- this is a timely warning to the British lab that they can't believe that the decommissioning for the left will benefit themselves for the right.
What is Le Pen French cows doing with their new reputation among the working class?
This group will use the next year's E.U.S. elections in a European context. U.S.A. wants to create the opposite, the lowest currency group.
If, as far as possible, the opposite groups in these choices are well displayed, this may first affect the European context.
My view is that soon in Europe, the E.U. will end the opposition and the worst currency opposition feeling in Europe.
Euro will not be completely over, but it will come back as a "European of Nations" that will be supported by General de Goll.
Germany and some of its affected economic systems can keep Euros, but France and southern Europe will restart their currency.
I expect that the U.S. will keep itself away from this project in hopes of increasing its proximity to the U.S.
However, the increased interest in the population in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen next to Scotland?
We can choose to continue to build the Lilile England area (usually).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the European law, as long as we keep our own interests at stake.
It will be easy to work together with other countries of the same mind in Europe of non-United Nations.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic freedom while walking the way of Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - remarkablely - is the most successful opposition-political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 based on the Tori-Lib Dam Grouping of Leber's Chancellor Elister Darling.
Voting for freedom at this time for Scotland would be absurd, because in that situation it would be subject to the rules of the constitution imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young Ones ‚Äî Soon to Grow Up
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls are getting younger than their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that stability can be a cause of youth in a low age
Young people in pre - Christian times do not have such an effect
The former N.N.N. communicateant Pat Etheries are experts in the health and family issues of children.
Should a mother be concerned if the development of stems and genital mutilation began in her daughter‚Äôs seven - or eight - year - old age?
This week, in Orlando, Florida, U.S.A., at the U.S. Children's Medical Academy's annual conference, Bal Doctors of Endocrynologists Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, they show new behaviors.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting the parents - that it usually doesn't show rapid progress in the direction of full youth."
The apparent signs of development, such as the enigma of the stems, the hair of the intestines and the body, appear before time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a significant change in the age of light (first month-law).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, the first generation takes at least two to three years," says Caplovitz, who is also the author of the "time-to-time youth in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem."
Youth development is the most accurate test time.
The beginning of youth is debated, but when it comes to breast development before 8 years of age, it's called "baby-growth".
In most cases this process will be slowed down or stopped - which child doctors can monitor closely.
In a situation of more rapid progress, endocrinologist may need to be checked to remove the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or system problems.
Time-pre-monthly-practice and other outcomes are treatments to delay: time-pre-secondary age, which may result in a marked increase in age and age.
The structure for drugs or hormone treatment depends on the child‚Äôs age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional age.
Psychological aspects are also important.
There are stories about caplovitious drugs, but they admit, "youth can increase pressure on moral issues, and girls can feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be understood: the parents don't just want their youngest daughter to be a month-old.
He said, "They're worried about the baby or how they're going to keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started monthly religion at the age of 10 recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this, and we were talking about mass religion, but she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and was troubled that she had started her first monthly religion among her classmates.
There are many promising principles about the causes of asymmetric youth.
However, there is no continuing evidence that hormones, chemicals, or media can be charged with major messages in milk or other foodstuffs.
Boys - like girls - are getting young in the past.
Caplovitz states that the main reason for this is the anger of stability.
He helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, adding body weight to youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but many other contributors are also involved.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls have a tendency to get young before their age-old gorillas.
There's a lot of explanation for this.
At global level, the proportion of time-olds, from economic conditions to the weather and genes, appear to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting their faces and genital mutilation at a low age, young girls are not as clear as they are.
Other doctors present at the A.P. conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even to the children and children is the appearance of the womb, and of the wombs of the womb.
In Morristown, New Jersey, the Balibe Children's Hospital, an endocrinelogist, Dr. Lawrence Silverman, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of youth."
The parents should not be reluctant to take guidance from their child doctor to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It can be spoken before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-development girls need to be assured that even if it's earlier than time, it's part of normal life.
On Tuesday, 3.1 degrees Celsius was dropped in the temperature.
The rain and the cold fell on the people at midnight.
The people went out by night, clothed with silk, and went out to the marketplaces, and to their possessions.
When the first rain of the cold has come, the people have also shed tears.
And in the morning the people looked, and, behold, the smoke was in the midst of them.
When the weather changes, the work and the disease will have a lot of relief, but then the dust cover continues to be covered all day long.
The kids came to their school, dressed in sweaters.
According to the Airfors Weather Department, there was a maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius.
Although 7.8 millimeters of rain has been recorded.
The clouds will be covered in the sky, according to the weather section.
For the seat width, there is a debate on the major orders of the jet manufacturers.
A storm has occurred setting up a line to fight for this month's short-range aircraft for long-range flights to the width of the passenger-class seats between aircraft manufacturers
In the long flight, the argument is centered on the width of the seat of the Economie class, not always as given by Airlines, but whose assigned position has claimed to be the key to the latest Jet Erbas SAS and Boing.
Erbus this week gives an extended seat of at least 18 inches (464 cm) of Economic Cabin, which is expected to be such an Indian standard, but it should be determined by Erlines by his main-principal Boing.
The time comes between the maker of the dialogue plane when the possible entries after the 17-21 event, from the command, began to sell the large version of the engine connected to the long-range Ercraft.
How is the last section of the plane built - especially if sitting is 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity forces are being designed to take into account the design of Mini Zambo Jets?
Boing says it's a "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 in width and 10 people in a row in a single section.
Airbus says that fighting with A350 will take 350 people to an 18-inch, 9-inch seat.
Air diggs often engage in commercial press campaigns on technical matters.
Now, there is hope that the Airbus 777 X will be held at more than 100 orders in Dubai with the Airbus 777 X, which is going to appeal to the public.
Recently it's seen that there's nothing going on at the beginning of the Viviant War that you're going to accept with this Phoenix showing it together in a restaurant?
Airbus Birch Chief John Lehei said that "Boing is also offering long-distance flights to businesses from Boing Regional Terbo."
As a change, people are getting better, but there is no change in the way the plane is sitting.
According to the U.S. Health Department‚Äôs estimates, in the 1970 ‚Äô s, Boing 747 Zambian in the modern - day term tha, and the average U.S. average of 40 - 49 years of age, weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average U.S. man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches [9.7 cm] in.
Airbus says that it was caught by a 1950 seat ban when the new name was the average job of "jet set".
Airbus says they have set up a research commission to propose a further improvement in the quality of sleep in 53-beds.
Boing argued on the figures of the seat scale of the Airbus, and said that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers to hire and balance the airlines.
It's also said that the research of a seat depends on the experience of more cabins than the width of a seat.
Boing Kabin expert Kent Kraver said, "It actually tells the airline to provide the lightning and the things they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us what they're worth."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the Kohani room for Flyers, but for suppliers it's a quick point that this can affect the ice.
At least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this dispute is estimated in the decades ahead of the US and European export competition order.
The first time the Reuters report reported in July, which is the issue of whether the seat layout really is a battle between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boing claimed 20 per cent of the seat has been operated by their new related engine design leader, 365-Cet Boing 777-300-Er.
Boing claims that the display depends on 10 vol. 777 x. Wand base 9 vol. 777 design.
The unit cost is now used to compare 10 to the profit.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus Travel Service, says, "Boing's plane is trying to create more competition with our products, and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-to-line cabin is suggested for the current 777 S that many of the trips are on the side of the Denser Laout, which can also be rented together..
Kabin, an internal expert on my basket, organizer and editor's Runway Network, said, "Octah will be very good for the seat width travel of Inch, but the fact is that this trading point of Airbus is run by the threat of 777"
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats, but provide a list of providers to choose from.
The world-wide Zet salesperson should also make a careful effort to check this out of the competition.
More relaxed, all the buildings are also providing high-density reliefs for low-cost flight services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350, but they say it's not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus has stressed some of its jet planes to require more cabin facilities.
It's not possible to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other designers of modern jet planes, but it can be derailed from the 777 X sales line.
New anti-nicotine vaccines can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vaccine that can complete the fun of smoking.
The same food of the vaccine, which was able to keep the rats safe from Nicotin's leak for the rest of their life.
Before testing is started on humans, and testing is needed, which may take years, but in New York, Professor Ronald Crystal of the Royal Medical College said that the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine's strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking by using all the current methods in the market today, but they found that nicotine's flow is more powerful than these current methods."
The new vaccine contains a degenerated virus that has been prepared for the purpose of creating anti-Nicotin antibiotics.
This virus causes the selectively formed cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of the Entebage.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine in the blood, and prevents nicotine from rising in the body by depressing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given to those who were later given nicotine, and they continued their normal activity.
Researchers say that but what was not given was "well," it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Translucency Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had Entebage.
It had to feed on regular intervals to maintain the level of Entebage, but it proved to be important and unprofessional.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because the artificial cell will become an entebod factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they want to smoke, thereby saving them from nicotine.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not find any pleasure in smoking because of nicotine's vaccine, which can help to save their habits.
British scientists called the results a halt, but warned of the need for more research.
Even after Postmartm, the real cause of Bagin's death could not rise.
The van department is naturally describing the death of the first visionary goddess in responding to this question.
On Thursday night, the workers of the forest of Ramangarh District had found a garden tree near the valley of Rezerv, which is by the river Rezerv.
All the branches of the garden were secure, and there was no blemish in it, nor any blemish in it.
On Friday, the Sketch Bodola of CTI, DFO Dikasha Nazim, the presence of CTIR's animal medically filled and cottabag's animal medical patient, was posted by Hema Ratra.
According to sources, the internal noise of the garden is reported to be bad during postmortem.
This did not reveal the causes of the actual death of the goddess.
The district officials were responding to the death of the farm.
However, IVRI Brazil has been sent to the internal parts of the garden to confirm the sea.
The Wand Guardian's Western Green Consensus Pandje stated that the death of the farm can only be natural.
There's no sign of the rain from the rain of the rain.
However, it has been sent to the ship to confirm its search for the area around it.
We are being influenced by the tripod Obide.
The former NSW work will be tested by the State Corpson Watchdog on Joa Tripod.
East NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripod's maritime flags have refused to ask for his political Guru Obid, former New South Wales guardian, Obid, whose government-controlled role was hidden in three roles.
On Friday, the IACC expanded its investigation of whether Mr. Obied has violated the provisions of the policy of the following government ministers? Where are the two restaurants and coffee owned by Obiid, after the end of August 2005 in the Rhine of Tender.
Lin Aspole, after the witnesses given by the former Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden selfishness of Mr. Tripodi, Mr. Obid, of the charge? Or is it being tested.
During the 2005 discussions, the government was forced to start public tenders for flags.
The prisoners were opposed, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, Obied‚Äôs company signed a $2.5 million - year subscription to the plates without a plate.
Mr. Tripod, who was the secretary of the gates from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the beginning of the public tender.
But they refused to change at Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi had requested a change in government policy.
A photo of Mr. Obied and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the head of Mr. Obied's office after working in the port ministry in August and September 2007
The assistant, Anthony Wheely, asked Mr. Tripodi, "Was the development of the scientific board policy being discussed in the telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I couldn't remember what I was discussing, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.
The official says that the Israeli fighters called for a call in Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the city of Latakia in the port of Syria as a target on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed that Fox News.
The authorities didn't tell us what was intended, but there was at least one purpose.
The report of the Associated Press states that the target Russian missile was AS-125.
Israel has attacked missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass a "validity" test on 457 wires
The government is considering a "validity" test for foreign workers on 457 Wijas because it aims to expand a hard work.
If accepted, this test will be carried out by means of a command that will be used to prevent 457 family and friends who will be sent to Australia to fill or extend unconventional positions.
Today, a government debate was issued, accusing the government of the government's vocabulary, M.P. Maxine McQu today said that it could upset the neighbouring countries of Australia.
He said today to the American Indian Institute that "foreigners are reaching the end of Qatar" and that "Australian people before work" are at a very unpleasant time when the Union has demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, it was the idea that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the area have seen the response of that historical witness, I will not be surprised.
The discussion letter shows the outline of the 12 approaches, which were first considered by former Prime Minister Chris Bowen.
Admission Minister Brandon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka that morning, where he met with officials about the holidayers, has implemented five structural changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "validity" command is adopted, the visa applicant's test can be made to state that "the name is true in situations where the person named, the owner of the visa, or the personal partner of the person planning the visa."
Employers may need to count the number of 457 positives, because the first businessman who wanted to design fewer workers has put hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan security guard died of a heart attack following the arrival of a refugee on Christmas Island this week.
And he was with him on his journey nine years old, when he came to Australia: and on the morrow after his father's death, his elder brother covered him, which was the chief baker of his house.
The Australian authorities brought him to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced an increase in study for Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 encourages high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Kremer said this project would be "Britain One."
Transport Minister Keith Brown of Scotland said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on this project.
In the first step, the new high-speed rail line will be included between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government surveyed the cost of building a high-speed link between London and North England and ¬£327.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking about Scotland's transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider rail capabilities and travel time and the possibilities of making better.
It includes the possibility of a three-hour trip from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Baronese Kremer: "Our target for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the Yukon and its cities closer."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be a lot more.
Without it, we will face problems related to the ability of our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain with Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be connected more closely to HS2.
According to Scotish Green Elister Karmicel, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed back to Mr. Carmicel to Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to be a major economic advantage than high-speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland as a whole in the case of high-speed rails.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in the British government's participation so that we can check options to bring high speed rails in Scotland, create benefits for all, and meet the Glasgow-Ednburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am about to review the test report with the British government's ministers next year and to decide together on the next action.
Air Force Regulations will now be effective in Australia
In spite of the mild step taken in the device management in the US, Australian air travel must continue to close your tablet and smartphones when you fly and fly.
The U.S. Air Force Administration has left open the option to change US air service companies to change their processes so that during important flight steps the travel e-book will be able to read, watch videos or play games on their device, while they stay in the device "Vuian" mode.
Travelers can still do so during many flights, but many people do not like to be able to access their e-book and when they fly and fly.
Australian air service companies are considering the decision that the US air service companies will do much more to meet this need, but they have indicated that they do not have a quick plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is thinking about the announcement, but stressed that the use of nuclear devices is still effective in the important phases of flight in Australia.
"Casa currently does not have a specific arrangement to control the benefits of nuclear devices in the aircraft," the program said, "this is within the control of air services companies, according to which it must ensure that the security system has always been fully established, and that passengers must follow the security instructions given by the members of the operating group."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she said to proceed on the Winnipeg command.
The teacher said, "We'll welcome the assessment by CASA in the case of the use of energy devices, because we really think it'll give customers a better experience, because we now have (Warless In-Flight Entertainment) in our planes.
Quantus said that it will now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We can't use power devices when we're flying and flying, and we don't have a quick plan to change it."
The FAA decisions apply to the U.S. line.
So, we're always interested in dynamic developments that can benefit travelers and we'll definitely consider the decisions of the FAA and its consequences.
The impact of this decision, every U.S. air service company will be different and will depend on the level of their flight.
The Wi-Fi service companies will need to verify that their aircraft can tolerate radio operation from mobile devices, as well as to investigate their rules of law, training materials, cari-on luggage programs and travel to provide brief details.
FAA said, "After the consent of the airline's patience, it will allow the passengers to use a light-weight, light-weight energy device such as tablet, e-readers and smartphones."
In low visibility cases, the operator will direct the flight to stop its device while the flight is down.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be placed safely below seats or in the upper decks while filling and flying.
The money of Ponbrokers because of the hard feelings of the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, the Bendemir shopping center in Ponshop, Amirthalinga is taking notes to pay her daughter's school fees to pay her gold, rings, and cream.
She said, ‚ÄúMy husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money has been spent.‚Äù
They say, although they make 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars), and their husband also works, but the family's monthly income is not enough.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia -- where households are growing in debt -- Valumex, where they're changing their lives, has become a third ponshop listing Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It's not the only way to get a record of the decline - in the case of S√ºhrer Amyrthalinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but in the case of almost unsecured bank lonion.
In Singapore, Ponbroker usually spends 17 per cent per year, which is less than 15.4 per cent of the United Supervised Bank, which has a local loan in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers do not have the need for credit checks or authentication, and they can make loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are cutting off their ponshops due to the increasing cost of living by families and households and users in debt.
For five years after the global financial crisis, strong growth, and after a hundred credits in developed economies, the low- and middle-aged families are developing a ponshop to meet their needs.
This week's rating agency, the Stands Ange Powers, has announced the growing household profits due to the rising Mortgage, which are a key factor for monitoring the debt of Asian banks.
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, there is the highest household loan in the proportion of household income.
Malaysia has 80 percent of the GDP in this list at the highest level, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
Ecologists in Thailand are concerned about the high levels of user loans, which have been light-headed this week.
On Thursday, the data have been reduced in regular export volumes and user requests.
The Malaysian Bank, U.S.I.B., said: "The determinant point is that with increased prices, people coming from the lower classes will strive to increase their lives in every possible way."
In the past two years, historically high values of gold have moved people to seize personal possessions, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to consume the value of their family's possessions.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the gold captured in the 200-pound state of the city is gold.
People say, "The feeling of singing is good, let's keep Grandpa's gold chain down, and they'll take it back next month.
The largest ponshop manager in Thailand, Ejimney, has seen 20 percent increase in customers using outlet in recent months.
There is such an increase in the decline in business that the Utlet executive in Bendmir and in Singapore, like 15 others, are planning to expand into Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also plans to expand outside Asia, says the Executive Director of Velumex, or Le Ching.
The company will use 60 percent of the $66 million that is available on Singapore Stock Exchange this week's listing.
While some disbursements (debts) have been highlighted due to high interest rates, Sussari Yah says that falling down is not only a constant rate compared to other loans, but it does not obviously increase in debt.
They say, "The miners hold down things that they already own, and don't increase the death of personal property in the house.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to obtain temporary and secure financial assistance.
It's not that Ponbrokers only use people who are financially weak.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the Volumex outlet, holding gold bar or rollex events that can pay up to 60 percent of their purchase value.
We have customers of all classes of society.
Sushi Jaha says, "These include wealthy people who need to borrow for a short time for practical activities or inputs, or small businesses who need to meet their link needs."
Sometimes they need only a little time.

325 million dollars for tattoo health
The United States government has insisted that the health system of Tasmania is also linked to the 325 million-dollar protection package, which will ensure that the government could not undermine the government's mandate.
UN Secretary of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the nation's communities, the island's old population, the high rate of Gecko Diseases, and the system's boundaries are "fast-acting" to address the current crisis.
The decision to raise funds for four years was made after the government's consultation with the free nation of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
S√ºhrer Plibersek said today, "The government is an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the government.
The 325 million dollar package also includes an optional 31 million dollar surgery plan.
With orthopaedic and morphine surgeons, 2600 additional operations will help solve the past collected cases.
It also includes the best care, training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health records to be started in Hobart and Lansesthon.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These inputs are in line with the best ways I've ever been told to improve the health system of Tasmania by petitioners."
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania would face severe reports and responses.
The government must maintain the current level of financial recovery to obtain national funds, and report on where additional orders are being made each month.
Three members will be grouped to ensure that they are served in an equally effective and efficient manner by the government.
Mr. Wilke said that the meaning of the $325 million would not be much more, "until real improvements are made to the public health system of Tasmania at a more reasonable level."
Nevertheless, they praised the government for responding to their urgent request for assistance, which they brought to the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilke said, "I hope that the Union's assistance package will be very helpful in separating the government's public health system from the list of disasters."
According to the government, these additional alternative processes will mainly reverse the recent generations.
But the UN Health Prosecutor Peter believes today's announcement is "band-ed solution."
He said to the BBC TV, "We're here because the lab state government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can't believe that the government is taking nearly half an billion dollars and giving 300 million dollars as a good news day.
Mr. Detain demanded that the Sushi Plibersek be guaranteed that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on extra employment.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its capacity to build its chemical weapons
The Monitoring Group on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important instruments to build chemical weapons and nuclear gas war content, while an outbreak of fire in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the location where dedicated agents are held.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Andolon Group said that about three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian home war.
This announcement of a chemical weapons-free organization occurred one day before the end of November 1st
The Heg-based organization has designated Domscos to destroy or "make uneffectable" machinery for all chemical weapons production units and nuclear gases and to fill the war content.
The main completion of the initial phase of the destruction, in this major event, is the stone of the Sarich Mile, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and the collection.
Syria is thought to have now 1,000 metric tons of oxygen and weapons, including Master Gas and Norwegian Agent Serine.
The British situation, Sirian Observatory For Human Rights, reported that this announcement occurred at a time when Thursday was increasing in the battle in Sapphira, which experts believe is the chemical weapons production unit and the storage centre.
In Syria, a group describing the number of deaths by the Andolon network reported on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that 6,365 children and 61,067 are common citizens.

He also said that there are 2,202 soldiers in the dead and about 5,375 refugees, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the battle since March 2011.
It hasn't updated the data since.
Some 20 million people have been forced to leave the country because of this conflict.
Assad's army was fighting in Sapphira for weeks with rebels, many of whom were related to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, Observatory said that people were being tortured on both sides, but clearly nothing said.
This war represents the threat faced by the observers for chemical weapons, with a very limited time-limit, a mission to end the deadly weapons in Syria during the ongoing war in Syria.
The U.S.P.D.Blu, who worked with the United Nations, was told in a statement that its group is "now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's announced important products and mixing/filling devices destroyed."
He also said, ‚ÄúNo monitoring plan has been made any more.‚Äù
At the beginning of this week, observers said they went to 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus and completed the first step of the confirmatory work.
The observers said that they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.D.Blu said that the two centres were "set aside and... the chemical weapons products held there were brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately apparent that the unit in Sapphira, one of the two centers, was not able to go to the O.P.C.D.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the O.P.D.Blu's functional committee next month.
O.P.D.Blu said, "I salute the strength and encouragement you have shown by the people to fulfill the most challenging mission that this organization has done so far."
This house war has been going on for three years, mainly by the Government of Infatuatedness and its security forces, including members of the Alivit Patt, and the conflict between the rebel Sunny Muslims.
In another event, Rami Abdurrahman, chief of the obstetrics, said that in Syria's coastal territory, there was a severe outbreak in the Air Defens Centre in Syria.
He said that this explosion is not known yet.

The Moti City Police has filed a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Permitt Singh Gil reported that in the arrests of Haboval, the royal arval of the moon city, Urf Bantu, the army leader of the army, the lion of the rock, the lion of the lion, and the army of the army, included gold.
The register office (previously) has been removed by force of the lion.
According to the police, Clark and Recordkeeper of the Register Office were taking papers from the record of empty and old lands and then buying new stamps and making online registrations on them.
This was not the case after the original registry was lost in the registry.
After that, they sold the land for millions of pieces of silver on the net.
There, they were taking lon on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was under pressure from the police and the administration.
The complainants, who were preparing for the Internet registry, were particularly interested in the lands of NRAG.
Because there's no NRA to oversee the land.
So it's easy to sell by preparing a network of registers on those lands.
Police Commissioner Gil reported that the prosecutors told the questionnaire that they have prepared nearly 150 networked registers.
According to the police, there are always cases of fraud and theft against the politician's gang.
A cry at the sound of the bomb blaster‚Äôs executioner
In 2002, 202 families and relatives who were threatened by bomb in 2002 cried out to the bomb bomber's executioner's executioner, saying that the Umor Pakt should face the firing squad.
The packet, which has been running away as one of South-East Asia's most wanted people for nearly 10 years, has been announced 20 years in order to build the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
He can be released in 15 years if he is given a warrant.
A 45-year-old, who was attacked by two night clubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, was found guilty of mass murder, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, which included the widespread bombing of the church in Indonesia at the early evening of Christmas in 2000.
The organizers had asked for the execution of the Magistrate Karawa, even though they could demand that this person who was called the "destructive person" be put to death as a bomb-maker.
This decision revitalized the painful memories of a woman who lives in Port June Courtin, who lost her 39-year-old daughter in the devastating attack by a box and her associates a decade ago.
By stopping his hopes, he said that Pakek should be put to death.
I really feel that he should be punished like other terrorist victims.
Sushi Cortin said to the A.P., "He should be standing in front of the firing squad."
I have to live without my family and my daughters every day.
On 12 October 2002, after 11 April, the club was removed after the explosion of the bomb released outside The All Club.
Peter Hughes, a bagpack full of explosive content from self-defense attackers, was in the PD bar 20 seconds before the explosion.
They went to a long coma for a month as a result of this bomb explosion and were "dead" three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that Pratec should have received the same sentence as that of the other three members of the Antak Party, U.S.A., who were killed four years ago.
In fact, this person must be put to death before anyone else is killed.
To keep her alive, and to keep her alive, there is no cause of death.
After killing 202 people and hurting countless people, 20 years of sentence is not enough.
Pecket, the last one to be punished by the white bomb blasters.
He remained in custody for about a decade, but eventually in January 2011, he was arrested in Pakistan's obstetrics, where the U.S. Army had previously killed former chief Osama Bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I.A. Agents submitted evidence that the report revealed that there was a Pakstan in Pakistan in an attempt to re-establish contacts between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Alquida.
"She didn't dedicate herself," says Miss Cortin."
Even today, he doesn't really have the pain of hurting so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by gatherings in Bali and Australia.
She said: "This year shall be a year of weeping and wailing."
Pakek can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.: Air travels can now use gases in the air (but cannot call the cell phone)
Viayan travels will be able to read, work, play games, watch music, use their electronic device from walking to the gate - but they will not be able to talk to their cellphones - such a teacher continues to be involved in many predictable new directions by the United Air Force Administration.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference in the U.S. government, Michael Huarta said that how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines will have to show F.A. how their aircraft, new directional instructions, and how to update the training books and the rules for their team members to display directional directions.
F.A. has already received plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetblu are among the Airlines that have already presented plans.
F.A. said in a statement, "On the basis of the state of the plan, we can accept the extended use of electronic devices very soon.
In the meantime, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the air is closed.
They are expected not to proceed until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet and are permitted by the Captain.
Travelers are expected to stop their device again when they land on the plane, and not to start the plane completely.
F.A. said, inside new directional directions, airlines whose aeroplanes are fully secure from electronic regulation can allow them to fly by air, fly by air, and use devices during taxis.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been investigated in such a way that passengers can use the Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to comply with these commands.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Agents, Laura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a speech, "When the policy is safely implemented -- and we will work together with Airlines companies -- it will be a win-win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we've just gone through "Hol Monitors" as we feel.
Agenty said that Internet access to less than 10,000 feet would still be banned by surfing, providing e-mails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data.
Travelers will be told to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there can still be no conversation with friends, online Scrible like the game, which is related to the famous event, that when Ecter Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the air park was at the door in 2011, American Airlines dropped them off when they refused to stop the devices.
As well as heavy equipment, the laptop etc still has to be collected because they're going to be worried about hurting someone else in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be blocked during flight.
Political rights related to phone calls come from the Association Communication Foundation, not the F.A.
F.A. can remove restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and dropping.
Last month, the March Journal of the National Transport Security Council, which is a national transport security expert in the B.B.S. News, said that the cell phone is still considered a threat.
Rozanker said, "The cell phone is really a serious issue, but not because they can possibly create regulation in the navigation-related device, but also because they can create regulation in the cell phone tower when they're in the air.
In order to examine this issue, the International Advisory Committee on Industry, organized by the F.A., has established last month that the government should allow more use of the personal electronic device.
In recent years, there has been increased pressure to reduce restrictions on their use.
Mr. Claire McSchilk, like D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that nearly three passengers forget or ignore instructions to stop their device.
F.A. began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when the F.M. radio and the high-level industrialised gases of the time were reported in navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies, compared to the last generation of aircraft, are more dependent on the electrical system, but have also been designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by the F.A.
Airlines has been proposing the use of Wi-Fi on cruise altitude for several years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to the regulation.
Huarta said that most airline companies should be able to use more electronic devices in the new direction.
Today‚Äôs electronic devices send low-power radio transmissions compared to the last generation‚Äôs electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, when the page is flipped, transmits a total number of names.
But the transmission is powerful when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who take sides in reducing bans on the use of the device by travellers.
In 2011, company authorities loaded all their control e-readers in Airlines and ran it to investigate problems, but no such problem was found.
The F.A. Consultant's committee expressed mixed feelings about the device that would be used.
The Douglas Kid of the National Traveller Association said that they believe that the device's plan is real, even if it's a Jokim.
The other members of the committee said that only the pilot reports described by pilots, most of which are very old, to support the regulation of the Aircraft system.
However, members of the committee arranged to allow the F.A.P. pilots to allow them to shut down the aircraft when they were low in visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and has told them that the general knowledge of the people who travel in the most recent period of industry.
U.S. Travel Association's U.S.A. Roger Do said that we are pleased that the F.A. has recognized that a joyful traveler is not inseparable with safety, safety and safety.
The U.S. Police, learning from the threat of the Sililab bomb in the shell, have been able to provide a room for the security guard's fire department and during this time of emergency.
In order to ensure that the law is properly implemented, the banning of storms, and the imposition of other defeats with teaching to the mind will be patrolled by all major places in the city of 1,800 soldiers, including cars and pedestrians on the crowded markets and other places.
In these young people, the PCR will include women with traffic units.
The city's hotels, guest houses and other places with PG will check out police workers and commands carefully and record them.
Tana SCHO has been instructed to organize a special investment team (SIT) for the investigation of cases.
In addition, DSPs have been assigned to check the markets, malls and other locations with VIP sectors in the city.
During the early days of the holiday, the dignitaries have also determined the duty of additional police officers in the People's Solidarity Police Control.
Police have been told to maintain high altitudes in time from the staff of other dissidents in addition to the DCH 16 GMS and 32 GMS administration, as well as the director of the DGI, principal director and DCHs.
To teach minds, the local authorities have now put the others on Twitter with female police workers under the leadership of Ngio.
The Anti-Bug Staff team will be able to stand in the white clothes of the policemen, who will be able to arrest the brains, along with the marketplaces.
All SCHOs are ordered to put 44 noses in the inner areas of the city on the dial.
At the same time, 38 Naca points on the city's borders will also be held by police workers.
The bird was abandoned by air transport to the forest for security from the North C.
The bird found on the North C Oil Regig has been sent back to the forest by air transport.
The bird named after the bird was sent by Scotish SPCA to his Eloa Rescue Center prior to his recovery by Helicopter.
Central manager Colin Sedan said: "This coastal railway probably was a cold-watered passenger of northern Europe, which came into the air at the peak of the North Sea."
Looks like this bird was tired and he took refuge in the Oil Reg.

Is Europe‚Äôs high class ready to deal with Britain?
Business For Britain was launched in April and the business was promised to bring together and determine what changes the U.S. journalist and prosperity creator want to see in our relationship with the U.S.
For him, we asked them what they thought about the business of Britain with the U.S., by organizing the largest and most extensive research of the business leaders in Britain.
U-Gov has the idea of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the business size of Britain, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey may be surprising to many.
We have found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming and growing, while the EU member states are not moving.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to the long-term and painful process of reforming the U.S. secret agencies.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas from the single administration to the product law, most business leaders believed that these decision-makers should be brought back to Westminster.
The single market could easily be seen as a source of unhappiness, says the businessmen that the cost of the Brussels administration is far more than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's commercial area - even the vast business that was traditionally the side of European companies, 40 percent of which agreed on this.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, U.S., to move ahead on the road to trade-based relations and changes.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the main business groups, showed that the business is moving towards a "normal change" that would give the U.S. a loss of power.
Its price is very high - the issue of changing terms for Britain and obtaining a better balance in the non-storey, U.S., has changed 16 percent on the side of staying in the U.S.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: this survey shows that Britain's businessman, U.S.A., supports their plan to talk about British membership conditions.
It also showed that the businessman, the current power balance, expects to return to the U.K. to make a resource change.
A better percentage is possible for British businesses, and this is being required very quickly, because Eurozone, the economy and the political union are moving forward.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that it means a new focus on trade and a change based on the way in which Brussels is managed.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom told the pipeline in Bulgaria that a new era had begun
The Gazprom Chief said that the start of the construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today there has been an historic event: the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," said the president of Gazprom, Alexi Mir, in an account.
The project is a major element of the energy security of the entire European Great Island.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russian export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is part of the gas, presents a vicious dialogue between gasprom counterparter and gasprom on the right to traditional routes.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, to end the link between the countries of the past and the "end of the century".
After the whole project is started in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at free rates from South Stream.
Gazprom said the concentration should start in other Downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of double-trailer feet.

Before the charges against Jonathan Lord against the two employees of the W.M.C.A., the Royal Commission heard the complaint.
Before the charge against Jonathan Lord was brought against the Caringabas, two employees of the U.S.S.S.D.Blu were charged with the crimes of Baal Young.
But in the face of the attack, he said, "It has never been the case of child abuse within his organization," he said.
The chief official, Philip Harre, was asked about the case in which Baal Pornography crimes were charged against a staff member of the WI.M.C.A., and another case in which Baal Young was charged with child custody in 1991 at the WI.M.C.C. Caringaba Jim District.
Mr. Harre said they knew about the first case from France, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that WA.M.C.A.'s side of the foundation said that "the outside of WA.M.C.A. has been checked and that they have found WA.M.C.A.'s first case of child protection."
With respect to the support, it is evidence that WI.M.C.A. was notified, and this year it received a secondary rating in August and a community department in the quality audit of four possible ratings.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with WI-M.C.A., admitted that the "self with me" provision has failed, and it failed to ensure that workers were clearly aware of their duties regarding reporting child safety policy violations.
In the beginning of this year, Lord, was charged with 12 children for minor crimes during the two-year term in the U.S.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Harre declined the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the U.S.A., which caused the workers not to report a child security breach by the Lord.
The workers gave what they saw about the violation, to the Witnesses who spend time alone with the children by Lord, to rob them of their privacy, to tell them that he loves them, and to let them play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, and he was referring to child protection training because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the WA.M.C.A. Caringa Child Service Provider Jacky Bernat was "hard to find a lot of threatening and most time".
C.I.O. said that he did not accept the workers' witnesses that they were not easy to provide information from their employer.
He said that, but their friendship with Lord has misled their decision to inform him about it.
Mr. Harre said that he had given the W.M.S.A.N.S.W.Blu's view to the assembly that, with the "John Lord's Event", it was text for the organization "not to notify".
Mr. Harre said that shortly after the charges were brought, a decision was made by the Child Service Officer Liam Whitley to sign on confidentiality.
He said it was intended to avoid the involvement of the Witnesses, but it was not "serious" and properly executed.
Professor Stephen Smalbon of the University of Gryphith said that during the 2099s, the work of Jonathan Lord was not a safe organization when he was working at the U.S.C.E.N.S.D.
He said that the appointment, education, access, training and surveillance of workers were "critical problems".
The hearing has been suspended for 20 December.
Browser says they want Britain back.

When the Cardiff had a crowd of experts showing the horse for the greatest horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet at school, and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his native Shetland's taku Taphi, who took three easy steps to complete and received top prizes - left behind his 30-year-old rivals.
In the annual contest organised by the Synabic Equestrian Center in the vicinity of Cardiff, the undiminished pair - which is the length - was greatly praised for its appearance, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he pushed his flat top on the white one and turned his two-year-old tophy.
The judges commended Fenton for his natural ability to control his age.
And Tofi got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given to Toffi as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has since studied with this day-to-day staff in Shetland.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Tofi are wonderful couples."
They had to face the challenge of all expectations, but they both won the gold cup and Roget.
This was only the second time he was involved in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy to win it.
The most different in this color field, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take photos with him.
Eb Well, near Nantiglo village of South Wales, this young child is walking on the tracks of his anti Sharon Howells who have been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howels said: "The whole place was full of excitement and joy, and everyone was playing and playing."
And he ran unto the full of the colour of the earth, and did great things in the sight of God, even unto the children of Israel.
Fenton is a wild animal -- he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he's got two birds he's taking care of.
As he started, he would be the greatest horse of the year long -- and I trust he would be very good.
The speaker for the annual horse show said, "Fenton's life is only three years, but he comes to control his bow."
They're a very good couple.
The decision makers gave the figures in their presentation of Fenton and Tofi's presentation and presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tattu and his riders - the best in the Fenton and Tofi ring in this case.
I fully believe that Fenton's loving clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
It's the Chinese news that's going to be a "silver"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to leave a manhani indictee, will be re-elected, a press guinamak said.
The newspaper of Guangzhou, New Express, gave a real public argument for the province of Chen Yongju.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed on television that they had agreed to write a heartfelt message about the partial government ownership company.
Winjamk said that the new expression now has to be "completed".
The order of the "sun" came from the Guangdong Press and the publication, radio, film and television administration.
"A primary test showed that the New Express of the Younging Ivaning News Group had published many false news about the listed company Jumloin between September 2012 and mid-August 2013.
Winjamk said in a statement that "the editorial provision of New Express was unorganized."
He said it had decided to punish an administrative penalty by canceling the Chen Yongjow Reporter's license.
It "commanded the Younging Evening News Group to make a complete improvement in the New Express, to examine responsible people for it in the New Express and to immediately investigate the leadership of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express a lot of articles condemning financial irregularities in a company called Jumloin.
After they were released, their newspaper published two front pages for their behalf, and said that he supported the M. Chen's letter.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories for money on Kingdom television.
He told C.T.V.: "In this case, I've damaged Jumloon and the entire media industry and its ability to win people's faith."
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I've realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express continued to apologize, saying that it had failed to properly verify their report.
In recent years, many high-profile individuals have been exposed to T.V. crimes.
Experts say that time-time is strongly condemned, even though a law in the north of this year prohibited authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
From 23 November, Mr. Hanman's text in the text of the protest campaign against the National Anti-Front Front will be the text of Mr. Hanman's text, which will be held in close proximity to the Crimean Bipas congregation, with 10 thousand children.

They praised Mr. Hindu justice's efforts to add children to everlasting culture.
He said that children must also be taught religious education with secular education for the unity and infinity of the country.

The U.S.A. has found one of the most complex drugs in Mexico, including its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. officials have described the four feet of three feet in search as one of the most complex secret routes.
Sourong is about six feet long in diameter, which adds to Tijuana, close to Mexico and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with similar worms, which make it easy to hide the tracks being filled with drugs.
The authorities said it had been stopped before a drug was released from the mine.
According to the court's records, the authorities have assigned a total of eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with the search for omnibus.

The British police sent Anja to make a donation
The British police sent a letter to Julian Asginje, the founder of Wikilix, today that has taken refuge in the embassy of Ecuador in London and applied for refuge.
Scotland Yard said that he sent 40-year-old Australian Aanja a "sacrifice note" for which they would have to attend the police station, as well as that he would be responsible for being arrested when he failed to do so.
In Sweden, as well as in the case of young criminal charges, their options under the British law ended when the Supreme Court had rejected their appeal at the beginning of the month.
Stokhom would send them to the U.S., with this fear they called from the South American country for political refuge, had applied for refuge in the ecuador embassy in London on 19 June.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Assay a suicide note for which they had to attend the police station at the date and time."
They're in violation of the conditions of their dignity.
The angel refused to comment on the police notices being given.
Asja is afraid that United States states will be provided by Sweden to deal with possible terrorist charges because of more than 250,000 U.S. political cables on the privacy-related website called Wikilix.

Do foreign property on lords, end London's creative position
The Money Department has calculated mainly C.G.T. solutions, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osburn, who had presented a 7-percent stamp duty for the budget of 2012 for the 2 million pounds, as well as for the person who prefers to live in a company instead of a different person.
In 2012/13, there were 708 million pounds of stamps from residential property in Westminster and Kingston and Chelsea, which were already more than the combined amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamburg.
Mr. Cook said: "After an increase in the stamp of high-value households and an Associated Anti-Avoidance statement has been presented, it is very difficult to argue that there is less tax on high-value property, which is not related to the influence of the system since it was old.
They said, "But this step can make it impossible for some foreign immigrants to buy property in London and to sell existing masters."
Prim Proportion, rich South-West London according to value, has increased by 11.8 percent in the last year's record of the home market, which has spread from Flemish to Vimblden.
According to the search for Seville, the value of central London continued to increase by 5.6 per cent each year, but the growing "home market" seemed to be slightly lower, as the city's southern west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the dog's belly and its muzzle.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the point of view of the box), while unchain dogs move their tail more mainly to the left.
But scientists now say that partners can identify and respond to this subtle secret of dogs.
This study has been published in the Journal of the Court of Justice.
From the University of Trento, neuroscientist professor Georgia Wellertigara said: "People all know well that the left and right parts of the brain are intertwined in the excitement that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we've tried to see it in other nations as well.
They said, "The right hand of the skull was responsible for the works of the left hand, and for the contrary. The two robbers played different roles in the emotions."
To learn more about how dogs react to each other's movements through other dogs, the investigators looked at animals in the movies of other dogs.
They measured the beatings of the hearts of the native dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take more time to understand why their tail sometimes moves to each other.
Prof. Wellertigera said, "We presented dogs with dogs' films -- in a shadow-like version or in a picture to deal with other issues that would cause confusion, and we could see what the dog was doing, and we could present the dog on the left or the right."
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw that the beast moved upon the two sides of the beast, that they were all at ease.
But when they saw the bird turning around, and turning around to the left, (from the dog's face again), their hearts were hardened, and they looked like nothing.
Pro. Wellertiger says they don't think dogs were communicating with each other through these things.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not about.
They said, ‚ÄúIf you have received from other dogs a number of times, and if they keep moving towards one another, it is more related to friendship, and the right hand presents little friendship, you react by the same experience.‚Äù
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, animal physicians and trainers.
Professor John Bradshaw of dog behavior at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences said that it is not the first study to examine whether the left or right parts are important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Linking team found that when dogs see an agrarian dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another search for the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot dog was moved to the left to the left, it was more likely that the dog would be injured than near him."
He said that this was because in different studies dogs didn't fully understand animals or robot dogs in films.
They explained that this could help study how dogs react to dogs.
"Although the various breeds have found enough evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, there is still more information to be obtained - and there are no dog exceptions in this case," he said.
Although, in view of the ease with which their behavior can be attributed, it seems that we will probably not find time to understand why their tails sometimes move to each other.
Because of Alex Turner‚Äôs illness, Arctic Manchus established Glasgow Giga
The Rock Bank, named Arctic Mankyz, has established Giga in Glasgow after being kicked off the main singer's compound.
The Sheffield Group program was set up to show on Hidro City on Friday.
But their chief singer Alex Turner's illness forced them to redefine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at the time when they were forced to hold Giga in Burkina Faso on Thursday at LG Erina.
In commenting on his official website, Arctic Manchise said: after taking medical advice tonight, after the decision to set up a show in Bermuda LG Erina, Arctic Manchise must also set up a show in Glasgow Hydro on November 1st.
"Alex Turner found himself in shock and they're not painfully capable of showing."
In Burma, there will be a show in LG Erina on 20 November now, and there will be a show in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We feel sorry for any inconsistencies that will happen to all the ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced Thursday that Pope Francis will make the new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, have high-ranking priests, whose rank is only lower than the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will elect the first group of his people, who will eventually assist in the election of their successor.
Now there's a total of 201 Cardinals.
Thus, after reaching the age of 80, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pop election - they come in the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Faerd Fedr√≠co Lombardi said that all current Cardinals' meetings, called the Pope, will be held before the new Cardinals are invited.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to advance his decision to organise the Pope's Day of February to facilitate the preparation of other meetings of Cardinals from different countries around the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voise said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that, as a general rule, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, Cardinals, and as they wish, more than 80-year-old Cardinals.
Valero said, "The next year's populous meeting will be important, because this year will be the first populace to be chosen in March."
Now there is a precedent for Europe, and especially Italy.
He said, "It'll be hard to see if the new pope, the Cardinals, are helping to restore balance from the rest of the world.
In South America, there are forty percent of Roman Catholics, but their number is very low in Cardinals.
Cardinals by France - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose work seeks to improve the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after being assembled.
The pope used to make his own decisions.
Valero said, "France has just chosen these eight Cardinals to help you."
He said it's possible that France Cardinals should be consulted.
But we're not in this situation first - it's totally new.
Valero said that the bishops of great places usually serve as cardinals, but France was "surprisingly surprised -- so we don't know whose name they're going to announce."
Gm has called back the pickup tracks in U.S. to fix the seatback
On Friday, according to a report by U.S. Auto Security Engineers, the General Motors Company, its brand-new Sverley Silverado and G.M.C. Sira Picup Trails, have called back about 19,000 tracks to correct a small drop in the hand-operated seat.
Some tracks may have a loss in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the association failed to comply with the automatic security standards regarding seatrest.
According to a statement posted on the National Royal Ways Web site of the Security Administration, "If the vehicle is caught in the rear, it may not be able to protect headrest, the driver's proper way of protecting it, which will increase the impact."
Callback models were created between 1 August and 10 September.
The G.M.'s track started in June and, in 2009, the top of the U.S. Automater, after the update, represents the most important Vohan launch.
G.M. told the truck masters about this crime in the north of October.
The 16-day government closure of the N.S.M.A., which had forced an increase in auto sales in October, could not be considered by the owner of the notification letter.
G.M. told Friday that, in the sales of Silvado and Sierra Track, which had been redesigned for the model year 2014, there was 20 percent increase in the first 10 months of the year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sira pickup tracks.
On Friday afternoon, 1.4 percent in the G.M. series in New York Stock Exchange.
The Struggle of Obama‚Äôs Thoughts
I gave Obama twice as much money as I expected.
They say Obama's great efforts have been forced by the U.S. policy of resistance.
The policy of resistance obamacaire‚Äôs website‚Äôs ills, drone attacks can‚Äôt be solved
Obama‚Äôs 2008 memory of Campen reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris Hard Medical School has a second year's salary.
I'm reading a lot of painful books today.
It's a book that I think this second year will boost my enthusiasm and give me hope.
Its name is "the courage to live", and it is a memory of the 2008 presidential election campaign of Barak Obama.
When I get up early in the night with my sick people, and go to bed, this book brings me to a time when politics had driven millions of people and the talk could stop your breath.
The election proved to be mutual, and the news speakers took a break to show the historical importance of the time.
There was joy in the eyes of my companions; and my father and my mother kept the letter of every one that was to come.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent of their license ratings as president of Obama.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a terrible truth, such as come back from the world of dreams.
It is hard for them to remember the days of hope: they remember a long time, and a painful memory of the times that are past.
I actually changed the first time I was asked.
As simple as I could say, none of this could have imagined.
I commend Obama for his many availabilitys, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask" until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the principle of anti-punity has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country, including the public option for non-violent improvements, public health services, the closure of the Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the time I took sides with Obama's administration and with my colleagues and with them, I had the answer that I could give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
Opposition to the Republican policy is not a response to the ridicule of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the data about the personal life of US citizens, nor can it answer the actions of those who expose the wrongs of the government.
It cannot explain the cause of the murder of American civil unrest, without any trial, nor does it reduce public order and business restrictions during the President's campaign.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the attempt to silence the media by the White House is "the most adorable since the Nicen administration."
And most recently, it cannot prevent the failure to design a simple website even after three years of signing in the law of Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, in 18 years of age, I should have assumed that the government system could break the political campaign ahead of it.
It is clear that the outpost office is not a premeditated way, because the opposition political parties and memorable events, such as the Newton massacre, will size our public debate.
However, the examples I have given above appear most of the ones chosen by the administration.
This bothers you the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was curious about his hope.
Mit Romani presented a corrupter and a certain option, which did not seem to determine their motives or rank.
I thought that a second task for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've been listening to for a long time.
However, while Obama's permit rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return from the book in 2008.
When I see him, I remember the promises they've lost.
This week, he was reading a portion of the book, which described the way that Clinton was severely damaged by Obama in the Pennsylvania Prime Minister.
In a post-Martm Campean meeting, they told their subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their goals.
He said, "I want my money back."
We must remember who we are.'
Five years later, President Mahdi, I cannot agree any more with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that the P.M. Tony Ebot had a good fight about the planetary freedom plan.
Arabat M.P. Clive Pamer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's fight for the Patrural Freedom Plan is good because their daughters can get pregnant and can benefit from it.

They said: "We are in the love of history, so that we may serve the people at this important time, and we shall have no other reward than ours."
which caused the adversaries to be troubled.
Referring to the meeting on this occasion, the Association President Ramesh Singh Neighi voiced a strong appeal to the corrupt law system in the country.
They say, "The rebels and their families are swifter in coming."
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He recently mentioned such events in different locations, saying that when the president is not safe, the general man's safety can be easily calculated.
RBS suspended two forext trades
The Royal Bank of Scotland has slowed down two trades in its foreign currency exchange department, with two scientists receiving this information from the case, another sign that the global speed of testing by the researchers in the foreign currency market is on the move.
UBS Barclay, the Dutch Bank and some of the world's largest banks with RBS have confirmed that the world's largest financial market in which $5.3 trillion is donated every day is helping with investors.
These will be the first of the traders RBS, who have been suspended by the Libor Interbank loan to re-examine the case that appears to be the case.
Bank has refused to comment on Nialmbun and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from investors this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "We've been checking in this case, and we're fully cooperating with FCA and other investors."
Last month, scientists from the case said that RBS sent the former trader and received the e-mails and fast-messages files to the UK Financial Management Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been released from this current position by the European Chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.M.

UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Vienjamk, Fina, that she is conducting a foreign currency check-up on the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, she has acted this week against some of her employees.
At the global level, at least six licenses - European support, Finnish, Switzerland's counterpart license Viko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and Hong Kong's moral authorisation - are testing allegations of being misappropriated in order to put their rights on the market in the money market.
Case-specifics reported that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P.Morgen, and Credit Swiss have also been subjected to internal checks, or requested information from the Winnipegs.
Banks are searching for a bad record for several years as fast messages and e-mails.
The report on the research hall, has given rise to obstacles in trades in areas that have been among the most profitable players in the trading unit of entry banks since several years, but they have to face this year's challenge, because of the low drop in prices in the country.
Some bankers tried to press the case, saying that it is impossible to transfer too large and too much liquid foreign currency to the exchange market, but top traders say it doesn't have to be true.
Supreme Trader said that foreign currency sells a large number of different trading platforms and uses the higher use of its own platform by banks that "you can start to influence the market on a little bit of ticket value."
This news came the day Credit Swiss announced his Exchange Traded funds from the desk to the trader to be served this week, which had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank is immediately notifying and cooperating with its investors.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone and has been controlled."

The Supreme Court upheld Obama‚Äôs health service law
As a major victory for Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Service Law on behalf of Barak Obama.
In 5-4 opinions, judges decided on the basis of a separate order of the Health Protection and the National Health Care Act, which would require citizens to purchase or punish health before 2014, that it was insinuating the government's power to advertise it.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other court members, while the other judges, Scalia, Tos, Elliot and Kennedy, were inconvenient.
The court has also supported the remaining paragraphs of this law by the 2700 pages, and said that the condition of the health service law to increase the government's medical competence or that they will all be fed by the federal medical money is not partially ill.
It was brought by the Supreme Council of 26 States and the National Free Trade Organization to stop this law.
During the opening session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican Presidents, including project-designated people Mit Romania.

In front of the Supreme Constitutional Court at its official establishment, the first Islamic President of the Morsi Arab world, who was free of charge, and almost 60 years ago, became the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of the regime.
And they took an oath of him, and made an oath by the hand of the 18 judges that were liers in wait at the river Nile, which was in the sight of the ancient Egyptian temple.
Morsi said during a live broadcast on national television: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and other empires."
The hard-paced group Islam Breedwood, who has been on the march since its establishment for 84 years as a non-governmental organization, and who is on the mark of previous governments, U.S. party engineer 60-year-old Morsi said: "Today, the people of Egypt have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."

Only a few hundred supporters have been gathered outside the court outside the court since the time of Mbarak, so that their motorcycles can be driven out of the busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
In the personal dignity of Morsi, who was ridiculed for being a non-crisis in Bradredwood, they grew up after their victory, and their speech on Friday presented them not only as an Islamist but as the hope of all those who want to carry out the task of the 2011 tragedy against the terrorist strike.

Founded in 1908 as a foundation for religious education, Cyro University later became the foundation of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrƒ±r Square, which is the origin of the cross, which ended the reign of Mbarak last year, and sworn to take back the powers that the President had taken from his post by the military leader who had been removed last year.
However, by agreeing to take official oath before the court rather than accepting a legally valid oath of consent, they hesitated to face the military's will, which indicates that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in Thahar Square was filled with dramatic popular prints.

He also said about his speech that they have no other feeling.
They want the party to be strong.
To meet new challenges.
On the face of the prime minister, it was the same feeling that they took the lion's speech positively.

In the camp, the head of the district of Jedju, Narainan Singh, the chief of state, said that there will be a rapid proclamation of the workers' mentality in the 20 secret committees.

Some people are born with silver and lead their lives in their efforts, and people are motivated by them.

A small village in Gujarat was born on December 28, 1932, in the position of a teacher at a school in the village of Khorwad.

In 1955, Mumbai arrived in Mumbai with 500 dollars.

Chen told the government responsible for this that they have been removed from political security for political reasons.
It is noted that, on the ticket of the Year of PPPs from shoppers, Gulam Hassan Chin Free Mohammad Seed was included in their ministry, which won the election in 2002.
Gulam Hassan Khan said that I've had security since 1996.
I live in the caves of the oaks, which are called the dens of the oaks.
A security hand of CRP at my house was in charge of all the inspectors.
I have guards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly taken back.
As the security weapon went out of my house, I spoke to the living and the living.
But instead of restoring security, he just said he'd check it out.
In this respect, when IGP Abdul Gani Mir was contacted in Khamir, they refused to know the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will examine myself how the security of a former secretary and senior CIA leader has finally been removed.
Prov. Congressman. Suffudin Soz said that I don't know anything about it.

According to this report, the U.S. government has spent 8.5 million dollars in the last four years to honour the headquarters of the panel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, no announcement was issued by the State on the Panel during the period between 1999 and 2004.
Modi said on Thursday, holding 182 meters high 'Staku of Unity' image in Gujarat', at the height of the governor's panel, 'there was no announcement at the time of the governor's panels.
While the DVD's record tells us that the US spent $30 million in 2009-10, $4.10 million in 2010-11, $2.7 million in 2011-12, and $1.4 million in 2012-13.
When central information and broadcasts were asked about Modi's claims by the Minister of Media, he said that they do not speak on the basis of the P.M.C.C. facts.
The U.S.A. did not receive any advertisements on the panel in 2008.
Tivari said it was because of the financial crisis that year.
Although the money spent on the commercials of the Governor Panel is far less than the money spent on members of the Neharru-Song family each year.

Advances in soil, rivers, and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Welle is serving free - of - charge health services in the rural areas of Cameroon
Wells and their group see hundreds of diseases every week
There are not too many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people
Set your voice here or use your mobile phone
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 notaries of the N.N.
You can vote for them or for someone else in top 10 to make a N.N.N. official of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had seen his sick father come to mind and faint, going to the hospital, who were not properly prepared to help them.
Jamel Welle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first, their hands were only broken, but an infection increased that spread to their brains, and he created blood vessels, which affected their lives.
Georges Welle says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we'd take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Welle took her father and took a lot of people around clinics and hospitals, and got what they could get.
He said, ‚ÄúThis is not easy.‚Äù
You leave the house at 5 a.m. hoping you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but that's not the case.
There's a lot of diseases there.
Some people can join in the face of death to wait.
There have not been much change in the situation since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there's a doctor on it, most of Cameroon's residents can't afford it.
Two out of five people live below the poor line in the country, and there are about two thirds of the public sector in the country.
Well, they say, "They only have a poor problem."
And because they are poor, they have no joy of their life.
And it came to pass, when he saw the affliction of his father, and the destruction of his kindred, that he purposed to do according to all that he had done for him.
Dr. Georges and his volunteer team have been treating 700 free of charge last year.
They became doctors themselves, and began to work as a college surgeon at the central hospital of Yoonda.
And they started a non-profit Escowim organization, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, they and their volunteers have helped some 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, the doctors take supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes they don't even have the kind.
They have more than once had to push the vehicle out of the rivers and out of the dust.
But when they arrive, they are truly given the greatest opportunity to be presented by law, singing, dancing, and community.
In these villages, free medical services are actually the reason for burning fires, and wells - their large shells and endless energy - are happily involved.
The next morning, their group starts to meet hundreds of sick people.
Well, he said, "We're meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from the village, from about 60 km away, and they come on foot.
All these weeks provide a variety of clinical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, paramedics, fever, diabetes, periphery, and John‚Äôs disease.
Others may receive a certificate of credit, credit, or free birth -- the school needs this document, but many poor families cannot afford it.
Makes the evening easy to check with the local conversation.
The operation usually takes place at the school's home, the Town Hall or the home; after the process, the patient goes to the nursing home, and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes sanitary devices in the General Operations Room, and wakes up in the morning and the rest of the week.
It's a slow pace, but rural musicians usually help keep the band moving.
He said, ‚ÄúThey keep us alive and play around in our affairs all night.‚Äù
Their people return to the city on Sunday. They are weary, but they are proud of their labors.
This group -- including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students -- has been treating 700 free of charge last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that because of getting free of charge, Hernia would be able to go back to work.
He said, ‚ÄúThis is what I and my family will change.‚Äù
In addition to running clinical and working as a slum-testinal in the hospital during the week, they also work in private medical clinics around Yoonda at night.
They say it's their second job that pays 60% of their unfavourable work; the rest is paid by private donations.
In Philadelphia, the second year of Draxel University's medical student and volunteer at the Well Group, Katy O'Malley said, "I don't know when they're asleep."
They are always in the hospital, or in an effort to make a profit to their organization, so that they may continue in these labors.
This is a useful opportunity for medical and nursing students who come from United States and Europe to join the Will campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In gynecologist's medicine, we're helping to get Dr. Welle's tools or blood clots, we're able to gain useful experience in them."
As a second-year medical student in America, you will never get the chance to do that.
Voluntary students usually act on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with gifts of medicine.
But after the years are come, their days shall come, and their years shall be prolonged, and their years shall be prolonged.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, it's almost a burden, not a burden.
To help others to live happily, to fulfill the promise of their Father, are the things that bring them joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Manmohan lions are prime ministers and their government, yet they must respond to Modi.
