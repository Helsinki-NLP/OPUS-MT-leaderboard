Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the exclusion of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalty for economic offences in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was unfavourable for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were taken.
Libya's Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, has its losers already.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
To determine who the winner is
As is the custom in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now it is a matter of diluting whether it is moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off by hand.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of war tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot and cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and probably did not agree on the above-mentioned Libyans.
It is true that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that NATO's attacks did not lead them to a U.S. general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting from which Islamists and our politicians serve to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expeling the "crossed"
But will unoccupied oil be done with the black Libyan gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can finally assume to protect human rights.
Every time the Sharia followers don't cross us.
Start a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the search for investors
A statistical torbellino has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has been stagnated during the inter-quatrimetric period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer established in Italy alone, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of expected 0.1 per cent), although a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent was made in France (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy rose by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-square period, gross domestic product (GDP) has been stagnated and, according to the CSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in growth of economic development is reflected.
The results are even worse than the predictions of analysts.
Main events:
Meanwhile, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but has been stagnant four-monthly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The eurozone economy and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, rose by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent in the meantime.
The interest of its bonds to ten years is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonuses has increased to critical limits.
The problem is also affecting Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech bonds up to 10 years are maintained in 4%, although the situation is worsening in the area.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should grant loans in the final instance.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets with the most difficult comet of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defending the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship's meeting.
IHNED.cz continued detailed development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Czech and heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its passage to the European Championship.
Due to the correct Czech defence, the mountain giraffes did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who had two major occasions passed.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup's date, so the national football clubs will receive about 200 million crowns.
Since the first minutes a good offensive game has been given.
Both teams engaged only in keeping the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patadones to the other field in defense, exactly what the defense supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear installations in Iran.
With his gesture, he wished to express his support for his country ' s nuclear programme against a possible Israeli attack.
The students went to pray in the afternoon to the facilities and then to the US and Israel death slogans.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in which they worked with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is a failure to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
The students prayed at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the capital of Isfahan, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over a third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children come from their majority families with a life-style that is not healthy, as it appears from current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where a healthy person develops, as well as the reference models.
On the table, obese children are fed, for example, from at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dinner fries on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Ovenity is not a coincidence".
There is no practice in children with overweight, which applies to most of the current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, have time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same nearly 900 children of basic education in all of the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "The obesity of not a casualty", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have been involved in the project from 4th to 8th.
A good diet and a lot of exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly reduce the number of overweight children and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, Wednesday and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the results of the survey was collected.
No breakfast but with butter for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, details are important, which also include, for example, a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Chequia, however, only 23% of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each breakfast alone.
But the worst was to find out that in 10% of the homes, nothing was to be eaten.
The breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the obese children’s families much more often the insanity of fried potatoes is consumed.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink fresh sweet daily (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are sports, but among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected riders (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between the ages of 12 and 15 from the point of view of healthy food are very far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is particularly alarming the popularity of sweet freshness," is reported in the final report of the study.
As the main food, the palm is brought to the paste and is followed closely by the bird’s flesh.
Practically, children always reject the legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive just information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesety is not a coincidence", a major change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy food," the results of the study point out.
He calls attention, for example, to sweet freshs, where many children would begin to prefer normal water and running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry and fish meat for the main food and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, supporting professionals
In the introductory article, As the stylists learn, I already complained a little about the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would work.
Conferences of three field professionals, how to dress with problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's no longer an alfiler.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (there is no man in the course) about how to dress a woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften a wide shoulder, extend a neck or recycle the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks about how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of huge breasts and hips but tight waist and at the same time do not dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the chair is so much so that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth cutting at least one additional piece of screen to measure.
They will certainly not repent, for the garment that feels perfect is irreparable.
With a measure drop you'll feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I'm glad that I have all week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, to those who must design two dresses: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question, needs to be taken into account.
I've been hit by Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, for me it's much better that, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will last have raised a hundred pounds (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gomez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or search them online and print them, then produce them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist therefore saw not only physically but also, for example, the product pages in the magazines (specific themes, such as trends, bags, clothing, etc.).
That's what the stylisticist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged the conference on Saturday with information about all kinds of bodies.
Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakob Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the stylist should know how to get rid of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
The variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a gabbard (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with cows and shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with tacon shoes and photograph it as if it were really a dress.
Or it's enough to hold her and raise her neck to get a completely different image.
"Judge with it," he insisted.
What is more valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I find out why we memorize all these formulas, which is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not about the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos work in combination with other clothes, they are all different from those used in reality.
All of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style they alone assume, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketet have made her a world star.
In Chequia, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I have enough skills, my physical aspect doesn’t matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to take into account that it is very likely that they will show us a very different size than their real (lesser).
Then it is only to Google and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has made/delegated, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist not just be trending in fashion, but that he has to understand the outfit.
During his work, he must first and foremost communicate with the people he saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You can appreciate people, you don't need to, you defend their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the dress and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take everything you had and say, "Come on, what horror"".
"Find at least a few things you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must end up in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is set around the belt and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as brick, strips, chitapelus, or impermissible. There is also a thread of nallon (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special pins of dressing in front, if it is larger (the hats and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to remain in the passive ear and put something into practice, we have learned to wear the soles of our shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing more than wear and wear.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the plates to not hurt them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me the joy of praising my job without reservations.
The truth is, I don't get very good at these skills.
This is only a small part of all we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedication to professional style is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly the same thing people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes for America.
Constellation
A journey, in principle unoccupied, is complicated because of a series of improper neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent, we were able to meet expectations, but this is not a matter of anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations before its stranger.
I promised that I would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing bag and, as a result of the show, it appears as a game that should not end up being a kind of action without more.
We also find ourselves curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As usually happens in the NFS series, the results did not differ greatly from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total, points are lost due to absurd errors, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In fact, errors can not be called, but rather the incomprehensible distaste of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
If you are introduced to a story whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this, it is derived that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one doesn't even have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to previous series deliveries.
So it's nothing from the rest of the world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snowy mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers vary from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to advance to a number of required rivals (normally in a classic race), then try to win time (classic chronic pain) and then wait for a duel against one opponent.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which does not only make things more difficult.
Newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are many less landscapes in the game of what to expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context mentioned above, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the tracks of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Of games of this kind you can't expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only few rocks, but in other situations almost identical, your car ends up doing uncontrollable pirates.
Even it's completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can make you feel bad.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five recipes are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's only a help in case something's not going well, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, not even the restation helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage in the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you will find yourself on any site "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifths or you will arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry, especially in situations, when you see two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent moves forward without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn around or stop well.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed because the "sorpension" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have another advantage.
During the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the time, you will always get the same opponent on the same site.
This also happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it comes to you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car.
The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline can be understood, but execution is so apparent that you will probably be disappointed immediately.
And it's a pity, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail of what happens or where.
And it really does the same, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't waste the boring, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during the race.
You have to be careful about the gas dispensers next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in most cases you will have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a series of parallel challenges, i.e. there are races in specific places that you will know about history.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
On reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, comparing your results with those of other players and providing other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach the metro tunnel (pass), where you get to run dark through the roads (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the train of the metro arrives behind you and takes you forward without more.
In the editorial we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the nice cases, sometimes to the superiors.
Because it is sad that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of the image is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the sound band is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "each one of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game avoids absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Entertainment is assured, but ready because mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.
The choirs at the University of Carolina will take part in the "Terciopele Students" concert.
The joint celebration of the International Student Day and the anniversary of the Third Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festival of Academics.
During the same period, twenty corals from secondary and university centres will be presented.
The festival spins around two concerts on November 17th.
"The University of Carolina has a high participation in the festival."
Among the current choirs are the Coral of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, the director Václav Hampl is in the festival committee," said the organization's head, Jakub Čaloun.
The summit of the entire festival is the free entrance for all the public to the concert of secondary choirs, which will be held on 17 March at 2 p.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program has the participation of Czech jazzist Karel Rožička and his Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening, the concert "Students of Terciopelo" will be held at the venues of the Municipal House in Vinohrady, where they will participate in university choirs, including the choir of the Carolina University.
The aim of the Academic Festival is not only to celebrate the International Students' Day and to remember the 22nd anniversary of the Third Revolution, but also to present to the public coral music at the highest level and to promote collaboration among young people.
The main organizer is the Czech Corales Union in collaboration with the Jan Kepler Secondary Institute.
All the acts were supported by the Mayor of Prague, Bohuslav Svoboda, and the principal of the University of Carolina, Václav Hampl.
The Festival will take place between 16 and 20 November between Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to the celebration concerts, the calendar offers a series of musical events, improvised performances of students and morning concerts.
Interested people can find more information on the website of the festival www.festacademica.cz
The Ambassador to the EU, Vice-President:
The Czechs have a reputation for negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calms down, and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador, Milena Vicenová, began his conference at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How can you not take your title seriously "clearly and openly on Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he was able to describe each EU body and its relations with such clarity and clarity, because it would be the envy of many of the Conferences of the Faculty of Law of the United States.
Vicenová also weighed on the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first arise the criticisms, that if it is insulting, a grey official, able to take on any role, but I must say that he left all unconcerned, because he takes his roles to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position as a representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union towards States such as China and India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc's cheese.
Vicenová has also taken care of the next agenda, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success two years ago.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The government's fall at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the Ambassador's words: "a good allotment", not only the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU budget for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, needs to be adopted much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, what countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled his main slogans, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the foreignisms or the jerseys that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the pepins are not really invented the curved or round pepins, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to prohibit us from Olomouc's cheese?"
It also intends to benefit more from the EU's environment and to bring more Czech citizens closer to European institutions.
We are waiting for Europe to speed up
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are better aware of the negative aspects than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
Guilty is a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when they come to me a Polish and a Hungarian and they come to me a Slovak, a Frenchman beside me says to me, "What, have you already left, those of the Visegrad Group?" and it is shown that it does not do any grace to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is expected to have new long-term budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have Schengen space and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"For the first time it was said that only those countries that wanted and did not, that remained outside, cooperate."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated between the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Burning history:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the closest one would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived to be current and yet has been over a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-lasting character has laid the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already welcomed the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to further prosper in our second century," said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businesswoman of Báča in Chequia (IM employees were from the first US workers who enjoyed paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in relation to the client.
From the beginning, the company was supposed to discover talents (as one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, whereby Palmisano will replace it with the coming year of a woman: Virginia Rometti.
She has been working for 30 years in IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, a rain of online ideas, resulting in infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning, IBM has maintained a concept of an institution more than a technological company," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Grand Verde" - as is commonly known in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is possible the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It shows the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among their inventions are automatic cashiers, payment cards, financial permutations, barcodes and diskettes.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfied the taste of customers and the time (IBM did not opt for its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if it does not work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively on Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is dedicated mainly to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmed and another fifth are equipment.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half of the supplier's share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the current global financial crisis for the first time emerged.
IBM operates according to the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the great economic crisis of 29 years.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased to a rate of 120%, and the net profit of the company has not increased.
The IBM currency is to change everything, except for its value.
So you can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "reloj of fixation", which allows him to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over his supervisor's advice until 1930.
Flint became the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are maintained).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the billing was doubled by $9 million and began the company's great expansion by the continent.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA to guide flight to space (in Mercurio, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, arrived on the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the company's consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a full high-value advice and services.
The strategy IBM has paid these last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, with regard to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Trade platform that allows minorities to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalization centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. Also here is a world famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rechtārová about his infidel husband:
Iveta, stay with that fool, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtāřová (53) said acabo!
After her husband, Josef Richtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore," explained Rhitterová.
When Darina Richtářová accepted Bartošov in her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ríčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
She even publicly declared she loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even quit him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who's in charge of his wife.
If one day Richtár broke up with Bartošová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with her arms open.
He's the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw it away."
"But here I would live, not as my dear and old drunk who was wrong, but as a man who joins me in certain ties," Rjtárová said and added that he had already left his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph still doesn't care that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I spoke normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," said Rightár.
If Richtārová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concludes.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical jokes from women, they will usually be appointed without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can cause men to bleed blood?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange that has shopping dependency?
Do you have to buy at least one trap a week?
Do you like buying in the underwear often?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should calm their passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to pass without more for clothing shops, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all in the testator ( ideally in all different colors)?
Although most women go shopping is a time spent, for men they can become practically in hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"Would you need to climb at least five kilos - should you start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases sound like it?
What is it?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to your mate complain all the time of your physical appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more the complaint rate increases, the more troublesome women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite typhoon.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum, clear the floor, remove the dust, clear the bathtub and all that for at least two times a week.
Does he reproach his wife for standing on the clean ground with a dirty foot, her children who have sucked a freshly cleaned sink and a stand with glass doors that cost her so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should certainly not deal with being primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unappreciative comments
"The used socks are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to get those socks used tomorrow too."
"The wet trap is not left on the ground!"
If you do those comets to your partner more than once a day, you know you'll be able to get him out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnia & Chismes
Some women are also exposed to slander, chisms, but also to insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best, every one of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chismus.
With the hand in the heart, this is the property of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are many women of those who are not controlled, who love to whisper and often do so, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those who surround them, especially in a female labor team.
Jagr and Voraček helped with their assistance to overcome Philadelphia
The hockey advance Jaromir Jágr took part in the NHL meeting on Monday with two assistances that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina band and put the Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star and took another step and was declared the best player of the party.
Two assistances were awarded in the party as well as Jagr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jagr said in front of the ultramarine journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party, I told you I'd be tripled."
"I had him present."
"Sometimes they seem embroiled," explained Jágr, after his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, as a result of the first blow of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the Hurricane gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who set the goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part the Flyers had already dominated.
Especially by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he scored the third goal, after his shooting took place in Wayne Simmonds' room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that it's the best player in the band, but it's definitely among the three best," Jagr said to his center.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm so happy about that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, until she set a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up out of two against one.
"Pender had a good performance in our field."
"I emptied the disk, I took the speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I tried to hit the disc and I'm glad I got it," Voraček described the party's last goal as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špatakek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for a injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
You're taking Plekanec I can't take one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local trainer lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"At last, but it is that nothing can be done against it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much to turn the players back on us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And that's how we're letting go," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
The porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How Travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travels only to the socialist block, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went from vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime turned west and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) are not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one had to put on the tail with a sleeping bag and pass so all night, or have "well known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for West travel, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses that the Czechs would acquire. This custom still persists.
The way of travelling from the Czechs has been a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was no longer the holiday in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, from which we are no longer aware today, that Croatia could not travel freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia since then.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see maps of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups slept in parks in campaign shops, as our income from that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at the time was taking with you the food (conservations, embezzled, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which around 1997 resulted in an increase in travel demand.
With increased travel demand, the agencies began, from 1997 onwards, regularly preparing travel using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly low compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on passenger volumes.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except for the United States, which further simplified our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism took place in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chequia to an exotic country, and it was in Thailand.
Since that year, every year direct flights with Czech tourists have made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting some 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, with what our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including spending on the site of stay.
Called General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months the Czech football has been without president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Federation of Football (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary General Assembly is called to take place this Thursday in Nymbork.
In fact, no agreement on the voting rules has yet been reached.
Without them, you cannot vote even for the election of the three candidates.
The interested and chairman of the Czech football are Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Haszek gave up his position in June not without first calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who is supposed to take up football in the future.
However, after the end of the Haszek era, there was a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Representatives of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only with regard to the method of election.
No consensus was reached, and no one in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full authority.
From this point of view, a partial agreement was reached, supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed, nor could the Executive Committee, which, at its regular, or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute revolves around whether it should be done according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application will win.
The Moravia Region is willing to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
However, the Bohemian part imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the living party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
It is surprising that he also agrees with Tomas Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rule established by the statute of all candidates is more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like you to vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was first nominated as a candidate and directed his comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta's still optimistic.
According to him, Nymbork will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be at peace with today's party of our national team in the European Championship.
"The football will again be a leading player, and thus cooperate more closely," says the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rijkl is the most reticent.
"I hope there is an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not the conflict between bohemians and residents, but there is an attempt to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"In any case, I hope that the common sense will be imposed," said Rachel.
There is no time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rijkl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could finally be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, would like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: the state grants, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sports (CHSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sports after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paklík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a suitable candidate.
If the leader of Pilsen's footballists, Tomas Palik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Federation of Football (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and not present me as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day, such a person has not been found," said Paclík to the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclik to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rijkl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Federation of Football (FAČR).
Paklík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that capacity, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved with football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might take into account."
"For me, it was crazy to hear some people say that they don't even want to be identified with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclik right now is Pelta's relationship with the President of Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paklík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, the football will get even less profit," Paklík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta was charged.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paklík, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president".
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could develop cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, the other candidate, Rachel, has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September, which ended in a façade.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also don't put the noses where I don't feel able," said Paklík, who in September was very attentive to support the suspension of the Committee of Arbitros chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and to contribute to their safe practice."
"In order to reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to the president of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it was under pressure on political leaders to make more money for the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems the new president should be devoted to."
"If they increase gambling taxes, as political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of FAČR should be "no party".
Pelta is currently associated with Jablonec and Rachel with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense of giving up hypocritically my actions from Pilsen Club to another person to go back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, it would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve the disputes regarding the electoral rule in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymbork, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could be good for him to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been at football for a long time and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Haszek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as they all thought were adopted in the June General Assembly."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
The re-adjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sign for the benefit of delegates.
"If they choose me as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond if this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, try not to interfere with your opponents.
In the past, he had warned that he was working with Henry Rijkl, whom he respected for his training in law, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It's been a long time without attacking Thomas Paklík who, unlike Pelta, didn't give up on his head.
"It has been more than a year in the football world, and it has already achieved some success."
"His attacks but were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them doubt his true character," said his opponent Pelta, who remained faithful to the announcements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
The latter should be free of football promotion.
"I would also try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then be involved in negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of the football would not entail any personal modification of the template.
"I should have first known the tasks of each employee," said Straov, where, after a long period of anarchy, an understanding nervousism was required.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being vaccinated before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymbork.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if you finally have a leader," two days before the most decisive day in your career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rachel promises, that under her leadership, FAČR would start working willingly.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current Vice-President Jindrich Rijkl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly be reluctant.
Rachel promises that if she was elected, she would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
It also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work initiated by former President Ivan Haszek.
"As president, I'd like to be completely devoted to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, passing through professional football or training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I'd do it all alone," said Rachel in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with great momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the climate of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not re-appearing as a candidate.
"They all know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me from every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up because then they would also give up the others."
"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no more," he said.
They say it also motivates you to continue the work that has already begun with Haszek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now ended."
"There are processes that have begun and that will have its effect within a few years and I would not like any father," he announced concerned that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the time of Haszek.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.
"After him there is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can blame myself for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only that will make everyone feel good and not just the chosen," said Rachel.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I have in mind to do as much for Moravia as possible."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we only have three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young live players," Rijkl said.
Although in the struggle for presidential elections, Tomas Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, did not stop believing in his options to be elected.
"I still feel that I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its vice-president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rijkl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns of unfavourable contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "declassified to regain confidence in the Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to the football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In case it is elected, it will probably follow what Ivan Haszek has already started and would not significantly change the staff template in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for my own sake," she evaluates her rival Rachel.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible, delicious bathrooms in Budapest: Who visits Europe can live its wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest your tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where to find the best in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a swimmer.
Smeared from the back over the water, he looked at the dome art on the top, swam to the marble angels, who were waiting for him on the edge of the pool and wondered at the modernist covered pool, which was methically restored.
She liked the bathroom, took note in her book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historic bathroom palaces in the Black Selva, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathroom culture.
She doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers her that the bath lovers have to conform with blue blue and chlorine ice, while the runners can breathe the fascinating smell of the bees forests or listen to the joyful traines of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools should always be so ugly," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The capoteo in the pool and the essential oils of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so large because all the senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, there is a water surface in the bathrooms."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: the high bends, the colour tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badfreuden" provides on 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly gives the desire to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the highlights of his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrated water in a unique karst cavities (cavities baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a few terms, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a building with a bottle-shaped shape (Városi Termamälfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools found in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city places its eyes on the quiet Zurich swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Langenfeld: Ötztal Water Cathedral seems to be an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
Three open sources rise steam in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise deep in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Baths of Arpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas treatment is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit the pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the desolate windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the curse grow among the blues.
The decadence was counter-resisting in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; not only neo-romantic elements of the times of their construction can be discovered in 1844, if not also an Arab alhambra-style hall, added in 1900.
Since its remarkable modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Selva.
"It's very good to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool appears to be of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, to 84 percent of Germans it does not seem acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifys the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that stakes on global commodity bags raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer's campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price oscillations.
The main experts agree that players have been disconnected from offers and demands, and profit from the cost of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from US competitors: he promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, along with the recommendation on how to manage the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices is particularly dramatic in how dispossessed banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank manager, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments of its portfolio in which it puts the money on food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann is dealing with the theme of people who are starving or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The Ackermann inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the president of the board of directors would change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation, you can perfect your image.
And he only needs to care for possible losses, so his successor will take care of it.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Force Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were based.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments that come out of agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would disallow a bank so to their acquaintances, 49 per cent would, after reflecting, cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The cartridge has been moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and rested.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern post-gerra passions, the clear forms, crystal halls, the courageous curves and the new construction materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is now considered a contemporary hit of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building planned in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, arose after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten near the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, the "house 20" was called.
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, no good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and has declined more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere museum was opened, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder of the modern art museum in Salzburg, implemented reforms with the insistence of monuments politicians and patrons, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he had significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he was enlarged and awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "significant and immense place", in which he contemplated the exhibitions "most every weekend".
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy dealer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the crystal façade was changed, an insulating crystal was installed reinforced with glass fibre and the crystal roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in old caoba tons and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly like it was before.
And all of this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap, and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of an austere soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
That of the pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why I wanted "to awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has been hit by urban fate. The completely new and planned "Central Station Barium", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another blow of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiate with the city about a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has come up with a crisis plan, which would prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against snowflakes and delays in trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The Bild newspaper, calling for an internal crisis plan for the group, reported the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of about EUR 300 million.
To achieve better availability of vehicles and the rail network, there is still an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the others.
The aim is to clean snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train accidents and delays during this winter also after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable difficulties in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for an authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train would suffer the break of a axle at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the US.
After the storm on President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant in the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to put an end to the contents due to the failure of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The financial market regulator NCUA urges many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which made a $20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the distinction between both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of a failure to protect customer investment.
NCUA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in summer-based disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the questionable mortgages, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the point of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results took place a few years ago, it is currently blowing up a complicated wind for US banks.
Investors and inspection have set up countless processes to receive compensation or punish deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
He rebuked the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a FHFA claim, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact number.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computers or Information Technologies as long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read the commercial report of IBM and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offered services and sought computer systems for the Information Technology Departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the CNBC economy issuer that has acquired IBM shares for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway of investments has come up with it to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment so far.
He commended the management of the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has long established profit information technology services such as the operation of computing centres.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful business teams.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose businesses he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rüg.
Buffett, 81-year-old, was commissioned by the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
Your quick and infallible sense of winning money has given you the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's shares in the stock exchange amounted to one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a value in a bag of over $220 billion and is a figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, he said Buffett, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete.
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
A newspaper is talking about a "blood ideology" that comes back to life.
The killings of eight small businesses of tricks and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, there has been a fear and concern about this news.
For many Turkish-born Germans, a ghost that was believed dead long ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing ground against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-rightist network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, or much less, predictable.
"Is the blood ideology relived?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informer of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rights pen.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with happy colors, such as a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a buffet: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the bottom of the murder chain.
The German "Hürriyet" issue also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Starts to smell badly," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He pointed out that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In the online forums of Turkish-born Germans, the conduct of the police and their subsequent success in the search are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought out suspects before in the ultra-right circle.
Some are shown as less rhetorical as regards the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, only self-defence and arms are left."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the adaptation of the penalty to the entire network," writes "Selen".
This means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in nine years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, then, mainly the lack of German policy after the attacks was criticised, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the shooting of Solingen, he sent a telegram of pessimism to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister of Foreign Affairs, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows the depth of the mistrust of many Turkish-born Germans in the legality of this country since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive explanation and a revalidation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for free speech.
The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost become bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has gone from a crisis to the next one.
Now I run a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank's summit in July, it was known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the board of directors of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and to the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets you comment kindly on your future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London has avoided all bank security systems and has robbed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The president of the administrative board of the USB was considered equally touched since then, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been known to advise the bank since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will be chaired in May, not in early 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and consultants and has had a period of probably necessary adaptation.
The strike is responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been a scandal for the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved in the past by such a proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreetly and solid, but also thin, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as a bank of investments in the league of the world's big banks.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank professor in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it went out to the light that something went very bad on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the director general, who so far was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, left surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was in loss with high-risk securities and had to amortize thousands of millions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found inversors, of course, that some looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank purchased problematic values to the UBS for many billion, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which became the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic fact that this was for a small country, if it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a bank expert.
The second was joined by the first catastrophe.
A few months later, UBS capitalized on a fiscal conflict with America and was shown willing to deliver data from the infected customers, who had possibly been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
As a result, UBS confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of the client funds.
In this way, within a few months, the bank has lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through false speculation and in the administration of property by aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was once again a little quieter, just when it was thought that the UBS was going to get it back, this unresolved operator's story happened, an individual operator fraudd EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And this, in view, has not yet worked well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Adolfi it is shown that the risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not control risk controls".
The idea of caution arose, with which the Swiss bankers had long been present, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no too great risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not match the Swiss private private bank's cliché, it's only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, marked by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are observable, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli depot.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marbled, facing large leather chairs, next to the bank's logo there is a large letter to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
UBS has become too large, I think, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Sonian Investment Bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the great Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How's it going?
It is spoken to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could round a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Opel were a perfect team," says the bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Opel, the intuitive that has been able to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Opel became Wuffli.
And at the end of Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Desatino arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the directors' meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
The "League Tables" were headed by the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
A few steps went well.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares, it was the highest.
However, business advisers highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the bank's "fixed income" language, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS is empty in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Grown-ups invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks have been looking for the decline for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to go, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
UBS posts have become projectable seats and are uncertain to date.
Today, the one who manages a large bank has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (also).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it's clear right now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian Swiss as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its Gribel predecessor.
In the meantime, he was charged: He must lead the UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the middle of the nineties.
Deletes 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to be asked right now.
Until now, he's just saying he's going to first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US bag
The imminent recession in Europe has frightened US investors in the beginning of the week.

What created skepticism among US investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be so quickly released from recession, and there are also more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, just confirmed this caution, is not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to put an end to the crisis, he said in an interview for the CNBC.
That is why it is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks from its point of view.
Instead, he throws around a decade of old principles and enters the US technology sector.

Smart grasses extend in the cities
In many places the grain is considered "problem payments": it does not expel these intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the grasses have been the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated for the crime and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem payers" so far.
The grasses no longer come out of the cities, the experts say in the first symposium on grasses in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grades; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make the life of birds difficult.
Grapes are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, negative media owners skipped a controversial project to kill the district grain in mass.
Critics have classified animal hunting by traps for birds and the killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"By expelling them and hitting them in a normal way, nothing can be achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Disposal of the nests or removal of the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are separated, the large colonies are divided and distributed elsewhere."
To hold them alone is imaginable as an exception in hospitals, old-age residences or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surrounding areas, the problem is not solved in the cities, opinion Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to accommodate animals in sensitive residential areas and blinds to re-occupied elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain cheeses" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist makes advertising against the aim of dealing with animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can endure a peak on the face with a leap."
Jürgens co-founded Schleswig-Holstein's teaching course on Ascheberger's grass, where letters inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only take advantage of the resources to access skewed mouth, unless they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four degrees until the intelligence of the birds arrived.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a chicken larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the clever grasses had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pollen larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their prey with the tip.
But the researchers left them a piece of lead.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four degrees got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.

The former professional of the Bundesliga, Zvězdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shorted twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).

At the Lisbon da Luz Stadium, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo has run a direct book from more than 30 meters to head on the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to mark from a distance and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the swallow Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, English leader Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the balloon did not cross the port line (33.).
Jiracek confirmed for the Czech Republic
Then, Collegiate Wolfgang Stark, of Ergolding, was in the eyes of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of the Bosnian penti, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark tried a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice-Camp cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished the last doubt in the 81. minute with Petr Jiracek goal.
The 1976 European Championship is ranked for the fifth time consecutively for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided a possible goal at the door of Thomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with both Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front, very fair at the port of Chech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the world famous porter's distance, the FC Seoul's front came back to escape (50.).
Finally, the goal before the final sentence was passed by the party.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of Zagreb's magic football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat in the World Bank of 2002, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the minute seven and with a long drop away, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the balloon inside the gate.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goal hit him.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in 62 minutes took place Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Daniel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish hold the first Eurocopa participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won the 4-0 in the party prepared for a preliminary decision, was put to the head in minutes 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was impressed with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until 23. When Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
Since the first moment, the momentary defense has avoided possible gain goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.

Personal Mask
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle: An intimate story about World War I, "begins with a long dramatic character of the kind that can make one's soul fall to its feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and convert it into your brand pages.
It will come to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's news story, and this dramatic person will function as his GPS, a light during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and desolate in the cloud of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What you've written here is a little current book, which correctly describes it as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "senses, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad, or die.
Their lives were here like candles on fire in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are gone.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the books of standard history.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the funniest war of trenches in the Western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" is moving expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hills; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intrable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina who is bent on corditis.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or running away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Farness of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, firm ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and to fix them with what's in it.
About telling the story of a German collegial says, "Sucedanos, by all sides succeed."
"Coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the next food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in meat fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and furskins of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden floors".
There are, it notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed for the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savageism and demonstrates about war: "Sit that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit in silhouettes with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seal, and claims that this benignism means civilization and that there is no bar behind that amidone and tachoonada lock."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will care or care about him.
"When one refuses to think of sacrifice, one would like to think that it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "a convicted person being held in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the animalry of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced murderer with good-packed clothes that executes his carnival while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who were actively trying to catch a venerable disease of prostitutes as a way to escape the service in front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococious pus, which soldiers buy and embalming their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate are rubbing it over their eyes, which often leads to a blindness of life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has "desolated exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as the Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No novelty in the front of Erich María Remarke, instead of comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, started from between your fingers that page of drama characters, and burned it with a candle.
After a false step in advance, a planned assault in the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying anti-disruption helmets.
The night of Monday was chosen on Tuesday because Zukotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, and his presence emphasized how the operation was facing challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spraying of spray pimenta on the demonstrators, breaking the department's rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupations".
And that's why the police operation to clear Zukotti's protest park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had been prepared to see how the occupations had been developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zucotti.
The officers increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the night of Monday, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few policemen I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zucotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zucotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they stopped when hundreds of demonstrators emerged before long after they had heard about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from the entire municipal district - dozens of mobile agents that usually flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when I was the least number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focus and loudspeakers gathered on the cross of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-grabbed messages from the loudspeakers seemed to frighten many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many demonstrators just picked up their things and went away.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the Department of Police, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maraine of the demonstrators' personal effects, including paper and plastic trash bags and wrappers, cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter were moved by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the blinds.
There were no arrests in the park up to 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The discharge operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were "adjustment of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The top-ranking officer in the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of department detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to go in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, he saw the police expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zucotti park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the head of a police car, and others saw them taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At a given time, a piece of armor came out flying from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a manifestor were hospitalized.
The support workers' union will demand the city for the fired
The union, representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to demand the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools dealing with poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the district of municipal 37, in its efforts to withdraw the fired.
Seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city's access to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
At a meeting in the Town Hall last month, the Education Councillor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the discharges were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council opposed him by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be fired.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be called for, and a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and has eight dismissed workers as claimants, all of them black or Latin women, as well as most of the employees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a questionnaire from The New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas in the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been under-subsidized in a chronic manner.
It is noted that although there were no fires in Staten Island and a few fires in schools in the Upper East Side or TribeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the 8th and 9th Districts in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36th Public School in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of undernourished parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.D. The district budget of 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools was calculated.
The trade union also states that senior school directors may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorising the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more often describes the act of transferring a school's nominee to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty and six parents' coordinators were fired," says the complainant, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar Gaddafi was captured and murdered, and that United States participation had come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution sponsored by President John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republic by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), praising the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the Libyan braves, when they start rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bilateral support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of US soldiers in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bilateral margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress sufficiently upset as to criticise Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually swallow the grass under his feet.
The indecisiveness of Congress was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "happily congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "honors the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the committee's main Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other hand, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican Congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republic of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually achieves a vote of the whole assembly in the House or Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in making their amendments to the assembly, but not because of the lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another fist that "will control federal expenditure."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to assume that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, a number of members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can perform, while representatives of José E. Serrano (democratic for New York) want to remove the two mandates limit for the presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic for Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and presented 66 at 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly introduced more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated, " Giffords talks in his first interview on TV since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman was shot at fire in an act constituting Tucson, the representative of Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared on the national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun will come out tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
On his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he was surprised to return to the House to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and humidized 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" for a long time, which was broadcast the evening of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaven and a long scarring across her front.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, he sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A fruit of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "totada", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who was two hours of therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the shooting day.
Her husband said that he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being treated by the force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time when her wife was recovered, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've just been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're gonna be stronger than ever."
The troops make me feel more hurt than I do
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and children of the Navy broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as then President of the Joint Major State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as a kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that military and U.S. public have had at times far away, sometimes, as a worshiper.
It is offered to troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are being punished by those uniforms.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of the desolate souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the recent years of Vietnam's war was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations on the pain are conducted in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two children returned to fight with Marina's Infantry, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "veterant and violent vet under the surface," Cancian said, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had kindly asked him whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding job in Washington immediately after his fight.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with the negative impressions," Cancian reminded his children.
The military concern arose, in part, from the American indifference to war.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely elected for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who ordered the US troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of turns they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged liability to the violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008, and it was directed back to its headquarters in Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who had a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It's an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the native Texas left its concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd heard my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her behind, throwing her down and rapeing her, he said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel look forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the claim they have filed against the Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be tried.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February presented by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their companions, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or providing adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going through the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from the top to the bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so say, it will present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be prosecuted by current or former soldiers for injuries to the armed forces.
By a judgment of the 1950 Supreme Court called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the claimants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in areas of war.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time the army is also modernized, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academics, allegedly promoting a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them high service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Women's Action in Service, a group of human rights.
His group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices in how he handled claims of benefits for those who said they had been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, aggressions are significantly underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which is estimated to be about 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the trial rates: in 2010, about 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were tried - half as in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he was asked to count the details of his rape 11 times different from a bunch of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker--from a cut in her arm--was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked whether he would have had sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared to be personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I came out, I remember I told my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, he was granted the service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow applicants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What lies between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of Doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go on its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will put his other hundreds of applicants on the queue for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we're walled, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type of person who was starting to take their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far away from being alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go into Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information alignment is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties on the right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online partyers from right groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen".
DEMOS work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like," messages on walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "supernova data" is generating an increase in research, stimulating the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to interrogate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that university students who spoke about their drinking habits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' fellows, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishs too many state updates with his drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Seattle Child Research Institute, Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" your own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and the Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation half of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information available - digital freedom defenders for a long time that they maintain that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, they like or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study that he conducted with the public walls of students' Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then it's the question of methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information of a user's profile and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a hat and a handwriting are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens out of line."
"Free and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a combatant of "resistance" during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who gave a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under custody for 12 more weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked under a key.
All attended with the aim of moving to the conclusion.
"I thought it was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when he came in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that it was not a mental illness, and said that there was no evidence that it acted with complicity.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's family.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons of Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.
But what Apple's fans could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered to which has been decomposed as the advance of a series of special projections in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of the products.
It was no doubt a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but it was also a methiculous organizer and a youngki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the idiots) on the trees of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the Kringely interview was used in Nerds, he said the original interviews disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Job's death that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited file material is Steve Jobs' base: The lost 68-minute interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points along the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly suspending his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Jobs comes up to the surface, where it seems impatient because of the questions of Crangely, pushing him to go faster to the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job's career, but there's something cruel and inspiring about Job's that we see here, the eager dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after I explained everything to him in detail here, he was and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to take a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you in an invariable way are, "Oh, that's just the way you do."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings in detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Uncertain by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involved around the world a half dozen times and yelled through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone at the side door," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continue to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two were thrown into jails just before the same Pope was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling it by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, after hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett on the phone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and what they were dealing with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the move.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of basic plates, he asked a customer if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to find out how to mount and deliver the devices finished.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agreed to have dramatic arguments... I was called for five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fired and I went out and found a designer.
Nine days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Tell me you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase their success, so these are the kind of people who end up leading companies and those responsible for products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is driven by people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary profession.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have come from the whole computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories make them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, everything is reduced to taste - it is down to try to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never had any shame stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met at a closed door to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge of the health care law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at a dinner sponsored by the signatory who would present the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the requests for review in detail.
One of the cases in question was a demand submitted by 26 States challenging the total reform of health assistance approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The magistrates agreed to accept the request and, in fact, a historical statement of 5 and a half hours for March is expected, and the result will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full custody at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general prosecutor during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, even if the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be included in the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who enforce the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were sued in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermined any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is an outstanding conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Chief Prosecutor of Obama's Administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as for now to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that I'm going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airline requests 50 double-passing Boeing 777 planes, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation estimated at over a billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company receives a request for 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the sale price for the 50 aircraft is up to a record of $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future aircraft requests.
In a study known as Monday, Chicago's company estimates that for the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double-pass.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aeronautics Chamber.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumed a fuel saving and a service for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay the planes, but that an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the greatest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the increase in oil prices.
This is important because they have fewer chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates consolidates Boeing’s leadership in the wide-ranging rocket aircraft market and helps to keep your Airbus SAS competitor’s attempt to invade his domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the start to add more momentum after customers would require an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped their PR opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's contest.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost her candidacy with the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to push the race for one of their opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state governor's career in Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they took over the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI Government of Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
PRI has the hope of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have crossed the border to Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, remained in third place, a great defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, refused links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while he was campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned the local applications for fear.
Although for the PRI, for the unpleasant appearance of the Michoacán elections, a victory will help drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called for India and China to be prepared to help rescue the euro area from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growth economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," the Financial Times said in an interview under the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"This can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, the debt costs of Italy have been put at risk and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have left.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the world economy to recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to be united to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU ransom fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital entries.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the rich Europeans when facing their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point, it will be realized that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go from vacation to beach and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howwell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asia Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "risks at low" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "containment plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital issues from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts that are in place could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in chains from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghanistan battlefields, to civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already spending $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequences, the so-called "sekestre", would result in 23 per cent of global reductions and a high level of new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible to run - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate many of our civil servants in an unintentional manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to licensing civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage the good disposition."
The cuts in time would reach the fighting forces, Panetta said.
"Although the financing for wartime in the accounts of out-of-mar contingent operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the war-supported contract."
"Nominee staff would be reduced, causing delays in payments to wartime providers, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published the letter from Panetta.
"This is not a result that you can live with, and certainly it's not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of national security in the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
Whether the Panetta letter and the recent senators' warnings will increase pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify calls for exemption from the Pentagon of the cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about the possible cuts, although she has reached work on the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential opponents."
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta describes new details of how reductions "make significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed earlier around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could deal with the strike, including those that are already being tested and some only in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new scheduled bombing, the new generation Baltic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Detaining the F35 development and additional evidence could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its partners say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent are deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging charges of sexual harassment with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The governors of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury by allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone claiming to the president of the United States, Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the joke with his quickly rebuffed disappointments over the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infringing the funding of the campaign related to the coverage of an extra-maturity relationship.
And again, no one who will live it will ever forget the media circuit that President Bill Clinton had left when he lied during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky.
The legends about traps in school and university exams are very extensive.
There have been cases where teachers have given student reviews responses in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
In any day, the studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That sure, many of those lies are cowardly lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
To detect lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must acquire all, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to proclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted deep research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been rejected.
The liars do look to the eyes.
Not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborize or worry.
Neither can it be concluded that the liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the declaration, microfacel expressions, questions and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from the investigations that extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more "falsely oriented towards themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people tend to lie less often to their mates than people who are not married (but the lies that they usually say tend to be "exorme".
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line".
Helps to provide reference points to measure after changes.
Watch the position of the subject, laugh and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone normally hits the foot all the time to not make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who deceive can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their position significantly, or display a "postentrevist breakfast" -- that excessive sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Questionnaires often falsely point out that the interview has ended only to seek this postentrevista relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who deceive can also use a remote language: "I had no sexual relations with that woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by the artists of the staff in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline, which has been abandoned following the US delay in its adoption
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the trade unions, while peaceing with the environmentalists -- the company that is seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to guide it again.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada Director Alex Parbax says the company maintains its confidence that in time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This came after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater were studied.
"This is a real way of progress," said the representative of Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed its full support to them.
The oil pipeline, from 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To that end, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have been betting on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force a derogation from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project only produced limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department ' s general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle demanded by supposedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York says that the diva of disco music, Patti LaBelle, acted as a loathing in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she was afraid.
The diathropist of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much so that he suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when Tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosaanna, teacher of the childhood garden, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Rosaanna Monk went down to the vestibule of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking him to Genevieve.
Rosana Monk said he stood near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came in behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said to her, 'Yes' and I went to pick her up,' he said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Rosalane Monk.
"I told you, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle was baffled by the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained in her environment and removed from a car that was waiting for her, Rosaanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but he did not receive an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return the calls to comment on the incident.
The claim seeks unspecified damage, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to give all the money he gets to a child cancer support association.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially when you are directed to a child's garden teacher who carries in her arms a child of 18 months old."
Climate adversity inhibited the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, reduced foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-recognised of the change, which generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adverse of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low fever temperatures, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of the other economic sectors.
According to the report by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage to 582 thousand 835 hectares of cultivated crops, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main crops were farmed, corn and garlic.
The decline in economic activity has resulted, until November, in a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of State unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated growth, as while from January to March 55,053 synagoguemen were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate which in number of persons was raised to more than 74 thousand synagoguemen, an increase in respect of the first half of 18 thousand,969 individuals.
Less Liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions taken since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market because of a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that in the rise in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who go from state to state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties of entering, and second because entering has also many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are looking for work sources here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloan is exacerbated by considering the high level of informality that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state does not work as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour cuts is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the workers in the synagogue was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In addition to the drop in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the highest decrease in the Direct Foreign Investment over the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of the Economy in January to June of the State IED amounted to $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent in respect of the $5 million, 143,000,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million weights per year, mainly of third-sector enterprises.
Debt
Before the economic contraction stage, the Government of the State requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion weights, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with a view to re-activate the economy, the approval of the local Congress was at a level of 2 billion, 600 million weights, and by November they had not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, it has failed to align the efforts of all and above all the well-synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Length of economic activity
Loredo López pointed out that events such as the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is a product of a number of events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing very much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Patronal Confederation in Sinaloa, stated that the state is required to engage in productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state are refined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that better matches the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been working hard to produce good results in various areas, but there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is becoming more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years of imprisonment and 100 days of fine were sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato by the possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the drug addict was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th position in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was circling in a pick up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was at the disposal of the District Judge and the sentence continues within the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Donations for works
Social work in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk if the Government of the State has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which amount to more than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million weights, of which 25 per cent were made available to the State, and that only the Federation and the municipality had so far provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes would be put into effect.
"It's almost 12 million what it's about to bring them, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we've started the works and they're going very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not provide the state administration on that occasion.
"It has already happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we have had to get the resources to cover what the State left behind," he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet the delivery of these resources, he noted that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to speed up the efforts to ensure that the corresponding percentages reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they've got to bring, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't even given us a fifth."
Valid "analogic monkey" court in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogous signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that preceded the so-called "analogous agagon" from 2021 to 2015, when eight votes were not required to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was disappointed that the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached so that the Court would decide on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remained in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in accepting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it for the digital transition.
The whole of the ministers also decided to dismiss the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the authority of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, so that the Federal Executive could not structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I also do not think that if I did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has constitutional mandate, the State rectorship.
The replacement of analogous signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, however, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "which can cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "needs the operation of the whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, to include a group of tasks which the Constitution leads to the authority of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issuing the contested decree, which somehow invaded the area of competence of Congress, is being provided in the administrative field for compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative Act, ensured.
Analyses the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PRI, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not accounted for.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality in terms of the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, while the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not accounted for.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Mary of the Landing Angels Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, only on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, but the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and the governor, Lionel Godoy Range, omitted their publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Secretary for Constitutional Reforms, although he does not have the right to "sanction them or vet them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Mary of the Landing Angels explained that, thanks to the adoption of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI, partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body will be possible.
In this way, the partial record of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be given in the assumption that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of vote and count in the file of the box or do not open in the power of the President thereof; or, where there are manifest errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all elections boxes may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election and the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party representative and/or coalition who has requested the second of the nominated candidates.
The total vote may also be taken if, at the end of the ordinary course, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the political party's representative whose candidate was second-placed candidate, where the electoral packages that have been subject to a partial count are excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation the choice of Morelia, where, according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and put the whole euro area at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that there will be a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "mark is now well-designed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the strong confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to speed up, market instability placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success prospects were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to leave on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the technocrat government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks succumbed to pressure to warn that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences in the euro area.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are advanced.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process that is forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties were complicated in the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish rock is higher than the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten cross the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 called arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friend, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While World Championships and Europe, number one of the FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of class A inter-selective games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Humana as the only one that has the 50 international parties.
That figure reached her last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the League of England's Premier League maintain an intense activity year-on-year in league champions and household cups, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia is summed up in the complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World of Football.
The typical footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is from the archbishop of Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play in front of the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, including the previous week, were recognized by UEFA along with the other centenary of the Iberian team, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's arieth, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly 100 is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista, with 62; Cec Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and close to Michael Humana, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz artillery, with 45.
After that, only five out of the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not start.
The historical golfer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two decades tour
"And Costa Rica is a dream made real"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Bajista Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band ensures that for them it will also become the dream of playing in the country.
Thus, the basilica and founder member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, last week, assured him.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-departure tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is on the National Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, is it a dream that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and for vacations; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do they tell their most zealous followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've ever played in the last 21 years have happened in the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that's what put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How was it that they discovered Costa Rica and their waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we understood, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have no time to play, it keeps us focused and it also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of large bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement emerges from a group of friends and it's a little bit common.
From time to time, a band comes out of a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on her tour, so we are happy to be friends of all of them still and we are honored to be part of that sound from Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like that of you stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we're all happy to be still alive and secondly, we're all worried about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do they find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too busy because it's easy to fall into this game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without being stubborn for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most importantly is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or I saw a picture of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we surprised him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Veder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals, and that was the band we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bajist, what are his influences?
They're so many.
Among the first to happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bajistas that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer fashionable?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-entered for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed by the loss of muscle strength present in the legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various diseases, including a cancer in the language by which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and the loss of strength of its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times of cancer in the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cysts, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been combined, the doctor mentioned.
Fujimori has been incarceration since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons under a squadron of the army that he secretly operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official commission, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between both nations and address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet the next Wednesday with her Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proposal for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remain tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 in a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The large-scale fountain passes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the snares of evil Bowser, but never so far had he done it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which this month reaches the shops of the world, has been designed from a beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without needing to use glasses.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without a gap," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally thought for that support", as so far success such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "sense" to lure the less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the most experts will be able to give a "second back" to the levels of the game, which this time present a greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guides to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous deliveries, which is that the source of the bigot will have to use minted dangerous platforms to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Column down from Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he gave due to the extradition of ex-government Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy for the US$70 million wash.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of justice had already ordered extradition.
He said that during his mandate he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave due regard to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Road Morales and Victor Road Walles, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional courts were exhausted to process the ex-mandatory between 2000 and 2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), the Portillo must be extradited once its legal situation has been resolved in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the deflation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The institution was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of the century.
This adds the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance in an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra and Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, joblessness, degradation or marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragall and the mayor and current Ecosocialist councillor Richard Gomà attended the event.
They also visited the Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats the current adviser to Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President set the example for Trinijove to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
A busy farm where macrofests were made
The invadings had taken 11 out of the 13 buildings, in Balmes, 51
The 12 inhabitants left the farm on the afternoon of yesterday without providing resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived next door to the 51st of Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the afternoon voluntarily yesterday the property they illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofisties that were desperate for the neighbor, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The occupations, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially sides of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the mob parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
His owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied, the business has dropped by 80%.
The disco owner points out that the bank's invaders had unfair competition, since they sold the cups to three euros, while the discotheque is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had to respond to neighboring complaints by noise, while, as he pointed out, trouble did not provoke the customers of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the festivals organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity over the past few weeks, according to the neighbors in the area.
The speaker explained that the trouble was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgives him" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks, he had received more complaints from his neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately remove the property to end the problems of coexistence and civilism that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but during the last few months the occupations had gone into all the plants of the building and in almost all the floors, and that in no way had stolen.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be determined against the incisism that has been generated in the finca".
Also yesterday, the Mossos set off a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 of Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
You park the mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the summons beyond discussions on honorary
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, in full apogeus of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed a series of Collserola promotion passports.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
It was also accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park again settled, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) - low (mar).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park redundancies in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with jabalis in the role of Yogi bear.
These included until, in September, the town convened a megacompetition consisting of 16 competitions for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's going to put doors in the field.
The question goes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational focus and for which it involves reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation among all the Barcelonian architects.
It is almost a recurring issue to be addressed when two members of this former cast of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact just stands at one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonian architects and university professors have seen.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", however, the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green mangans, has not been carried out.
"It is from the base that Barcelona's longest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Collserola doors" includes a "lexical trap": it should not be thought of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action is to be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual network" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project public space" after the experience of the 80s and that it had in the Forum area "his corner of the cisne".
The first fear is the own delimitation of borders on where to build.
"Limiting something is the next step," that is, its overpass.
"There is a need to think about new urban instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GDP) ] can lead to real disasters."
More censored to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographic issue.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola patronate that "must not fall into broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity the town council offers to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "read" about whether this is this technical profile which must lead multidisciplinary teams ("all an acretion", he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona implies that the answer to the question to this part is complex, because in the basis of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 transversal contests - ten - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This results, at least in their case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In other words, a project for one of the doors can shock in program and definition with the architect of the side door.
In its view, that is, the town should ensure that the branch immediately exceeds the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives to Jonás Larrazábal and will release
After 72 days of drag, the legal arrest of the Red Casino granted the pardon to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal commander of the Red Casino will grant him forgiveness before the District Criminal Trial, which follows a process of blackmail against the mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Panist Mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraygo 1, located in the Old Town of the capital of the State.
In that place, a second order of withdrawal remained for 49 days after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs dismissed the crimes of coercion and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison, allegedly for blackmailing with a million and a half weight to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the middle security prison as there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that at almost two months of investigation sufficient evidence had been found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the sum of 1.5 million pounds to the representatives of the house of bets in exchange for the operation of the house.
This Monday, the legal commander of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, approached Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the coming hours he could recover his freedom.
During legal diligence, the official of the Public Ministry admitted to the judge, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the house of bets was the one that granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the file 197/2011, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim can be made about the process that followed; in addition, no damages or punishment will be required.
After the hearing to the legal holder of the house of bets, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the judge, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It shall also notify it of the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more persons lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft was fired, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the rifle."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the necessary requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a pendant of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has ensured that it is a priority to count on the results before possible; however, the investigation may take several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State operated at a cruise speed and that this happened in a rising soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, SCT holder Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM provided adequate conditions for the discharge, as the aircraft moves forward to the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-level clouds.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of cloudy conditions, the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft registration coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side route.
The aircraft’s residual dispersion pattern allows the helicopter to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
On the site of the sinister, no evidence remains on the remains of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that there could have been multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an altitude of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope that ranges from seven degrees to 30 degrees of slope.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to be decommissioned during that journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no dispersal parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity genes
Social Security conducts a research to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it would conduct an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people, called the Protocol 'Genetics of Obesity of Childhood and Adolescence', which would allow to be associated with overweight markers.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IGN).
The research calls for participation in the population whether or not it is legal, to visit the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, all Saturdays from 8:00.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Pontient) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day required that the goal be to gather three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of hereditary diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger sufferings such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is in the interest of health professionals because of the alarming increase in weight in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of 47 per cent in girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed', the IMSS specialist highlighted.
It indicated that the justification for the search for markers is that the population of the country differs from others because of their genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 per cent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured patches (acantosis) in the neck and antebrasis, which indicate the probability of metabolic and even prediabetes changes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it to the parents in writing, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use transport means instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid bays
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent to the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand basins each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphalt floor is the right, the basins could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
At his conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of basins.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some high molecular weights, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weights, called maltens, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes fragile, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but that it is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When passing the vehicles and making efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer felt.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of fine stone material, i.e., a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is about the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rotation folder also requires proper thickness and the material that is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a rewinding of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of basins.
In the process of forming a basin, he said, the first to wear is the film of rotation and only then affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be followed by the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Investigators also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of tanks, and therefore the thickness of each of the floor layers must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is carried out, in order to avoid the frequent formation of tanks.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow for easy and no need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors involved so that Melina Ramírez Serna does not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley is entitled to the 14th Princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley remains with the wishes of the crown of Signorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being in the podium of winners, shine the silver crown and the band that believed her as a new princess in Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss raised herself with the crown and the cetro, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of Valecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were famous princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today's big question that many are asking is what's wrong?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained kingdoms such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who carried the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered to be key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you for and why? done by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Literary Leamos Street.
The interviewer Valecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culture, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The principle," it's a pretty deep book.
I now read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of universal literature that we all have to read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Fire of Blood"".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining specifically how each of the books quoted had marked it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, it proved to be calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book."
Among the potentials launched is said to have burned the favouriteism in Valle.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that when being the preferred, the ovation and the candidate carrying all the preliminary prizes (Oster Gastronomy Network, public vote for the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), "this aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first performance in bathroom on the Hilton beach and his two shows on the crowning veil.
Although both of them were safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlantic representatives had shown.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "As at home", of the RCN Channel, believed that the fact that Melina was appointed a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was shown the last very wrong with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his faults in the back and the fibrosis that was noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens' Preparation Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very familiar, dropped points on the last day".
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the Valecaucana was the surgical interventions that took place.
"The surgery is good, but Valle is not supposed to do it.
Her body was never strong and here it was collected."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the show in the bath suit came a cruel Vatican which was performed last night, because it was said that this was the pleasure that Raymundo gave Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has since now started a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go to history as one of the queens who, in spite of her arrollor passing by Cartagena, was misled by the crown.
So was the work of the road that identified Alfonso Cano's corpse.
A Lophoscopist from Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a CTI Lofoscopist from Cali went on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the quote of his fingerprints.
Of the seven Lofoscopists working in the CTI section, this week he played the "available" shift to Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial research area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he often had to enter the forest for more than five days to get to the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after conducting the relevant courses, he specialized in lopposcopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e., palm trees of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alfonso Cano aliases in Eliezer warned him to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being one of the men leading to the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo Leon Sáenz's (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it for his physical appearance, for it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
I was without a beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more delicate.
But the leaves don't lie.
With a galtonian magnifying lamp, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliezer compared the dental impressions of the body to those of the card.
His eye failed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the chief of the Farc.
In Search of the Tag
For a dactyloscopeist from Sijén de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliaszar González, in the press wheel for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any error, which can become a key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, locoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false papers or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told him that, in a case of theft, he was moved to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the mark from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different storms," he recalled.
The traces can also be discarded or reaffirmed suspiciously in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through research it was determined that a family could be suspected of crime and, indeed, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that the killer has been, it does sit in the scene of the crime.
A Dactiloscopist from the CTI explained that in the objects "the leaves are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches is a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
The "indignity" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the Zuccotti square to camp.
A large part of them attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday to try to reenter, under a judicial order, the Manhattan square from where they were uninhabited in the morning and to try to occupy another Grand Manzana park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zukotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "indigested" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the desert by occupying a more park north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp back in the square, we will be installed somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle for returning to Zukotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmans of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the "indigested" response to the disappearance of his camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indigested" carried out the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which includes New York and New Jersey, and property of Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while ensuring that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who have been established at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square - which is a private property network - remains closed pending the conclusion of a judicial review scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced there brought and distributed copies of that court order to these hours and even handed them over to the officers who kept the place, which caused "some small confrontations," said Bray, who reported that some officers had inflicted beatings on the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from disengageing or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops or other properties that they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, whom he warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to be re-installed with campaigns and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the discharge carried out in the early morning of Zucotti Square, an operation in which approximately 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violationing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "in a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm others", since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The departure of this morning was austerity and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "infringing respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests took place, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television navigation
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian representatives, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", escorted by "Baywatch", cone of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be Virgin Mary in a special Christmas of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "croner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominents, will appear in the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet distribution of a video porn home in which he appeared together with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting in a figure a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comicist of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special swimmer of CTV has with the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange about the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still colluding by the devastating earthquake that has been in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has ever suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo were $30 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three consecutive trims of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September was used to pass the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous trimester and 6% at the annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the response of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas secluded by the seismic and later tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital costs observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to serve as a means of increasing from scratch.
Japan has, above all, woken up thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable was 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
The Yemeni flag
Tokyo has been ordered to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "values of refuge" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a lot in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September to quote the yen.
While the markets continue to be based on the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not fall in guard.
"There must be attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday's Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) required that most of the member countries present in September more clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the world economy's inflation points highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
Since four tenths went down to the 100.4 points, compared to the 100.8 August.
The euro area, including the euro area, was below the average, which is at level 100, with eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds the doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional transitional government is more imposed on the demands of Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by fact.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment might be short for implementation, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support any new austerity measures and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not dismiss any doubts about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed anything else."
The conservative leader was a further step in its push for the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will not give a good view of any letter of commitment to the adjustments.
But the European Commission, as yet hidden from the impact of the Papandreou referendum's order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return to Athens " very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date either.
The Greek wood still has a thread for the mouse.
Lady Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponding" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the plant in relation to this tool of cooperation, whose "being" pointed out to be an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened the World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "an absolute necessity" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with the horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in what it aims to reduce half the volume of people living with income below a daily dollar, with which the "poor of poverty" is set."
Spain "remains working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Mrs. Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions originating in the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many the achievements achieved" and "many the challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is set not only as a forum for discussion but also as a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will leave the poverty threshold in which they are added.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years in pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is he who described the father of this tool as a "beautiful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed by a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" collected in Valladolid by the "poor baker".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in seeking solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit as "a serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "success" of giving "confidential" to people "exclusively to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens their contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
On the first day of the Christian-Democrat Union Congress (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, it has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the militants who believed that the government's policy was currently too strict with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Minister of Finance's Eurofil, throw away any doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is a peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way to Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the twenty-six will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball's on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl to calm the spirits within his party, but he has also not tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe relates to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The impact of fraud on lows per disease
After grants, the UMP and the Government have committed an offensive against the lows of disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Burdeos on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family grant box and give a talk on the subject, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, the majority want to focus on the sick.
First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth-day deficit on private sector workers before being able to take down.
Finally, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, I would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remuneration for employees in the case of low work (to date, there is no shortage, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority are re-launching the issue of fraud as well, this time oriented towards abuses of the labour market.
"There will be a significant increase in controls and, in addition, if someone is found committing fraud, he will have to refund the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned, speaking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the ad seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-employment fraud.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched which have normally produced fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay attention, first, to the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006 for low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, low-income subsidies accounted for 5% of the health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11,300 million.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to the disease reduction, which amounts to EUR 6,200 million.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
One medium that undoubtedly conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Syria Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of low sickness.
Another study, in this case of disease insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of the disease-related decreases had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to get low by disease.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the overall unemployment rate (both for health and other reasons) was between 10 and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
In the lows of disease, fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to the systematic control of the disease-related lows of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 cases, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of reductions of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "suitably adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million as a result, amounts to 132.000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are therefore reached among several million workers who have taken a low sickness rate.
There is no doubt a significant figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9,000 and EUR 15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, much more than fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he added that the hundreds of days that have been granted to his union Government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address during the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote on confidence in Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "up to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating fraud, but against any policy that prevented economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all the parties to the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything due to external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take provisions for that purpose.
This was one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient proposes this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada holds its tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death".
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up in the hospital.
Together, the highest rate in this sense registers Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that he did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more surpluses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, eligible for euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they feel that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not imply that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process against them should not be initiated.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as reported by the authors of the report.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it is suggested that the Penal Code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, except for the purpose of reducing physical pain, be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other health law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deshamps, a health specialist, has described the position of experts signing the report as "extremely" because, among other things, it is not limited to the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deshamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deshamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which he described as "a demonstration for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly places the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a plot
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachhar El Asad's supporters appeared yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure was intensified on Syria of Bachar El Asad, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "competence" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have shown support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday who asked President Bachar El Asad to "let go of power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been taking since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have been unsuccessful.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," said Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking a more and more hard stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that the Syrian regime has been "strengthened by consensus against Asad and the actions of the regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tough tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have been killed "for bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs city, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, considers the country as "a step towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has responded strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend the damasc of its functions, which in his opinion constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not flake," he added, guaranteeing that "the plots made against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the military media and observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, has also expressed his support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime, which he considers to be part of the “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow at Rabat is expected to be held to implement the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and release of the detainees.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday as "inaccurate" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not support the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for the markets to train their equipment and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to recover lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, no doubt a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and of the bonders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will have patience and understand it".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then anxiety was imposed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily composed of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, consider.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working, when he is in charge, taking into account the urgency and with the objective that Italy "recovery its protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn has pointed out that "including a new government, will not vary our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the last few months, has asked for new strict measures.
The Italian "head of the leaders" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mattes, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competency and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is an "exchange of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some EUR 200,000 million in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to a U.S. NGO specialized in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that agency of the United Nations.
The IAEA expressed its "great concern" last week for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since 1960, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then believed to have cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as a Member State has reported to the Agency, worked during most of its career in this technology in the military programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or only slightly increased, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the number of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as reported by the FBI.
"After a 2009 decline, it is worrying that this type of crime and crime has increased again," the Human Rights First Human Rights Defence Organization stressed, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First takes a long time pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to the race, the color of the skin, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed Monday's presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet or follow you.
This allows you to know whether you are tracking messages, if you are subscribed to new accounts, if you prefer some messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tried "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as AFP has indicated Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, follow-friday to recommend following another user) making the initiative happy, opens a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the big public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have discussed the interest of "tweets" with different opinions of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much on Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budget "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid possible deterioration of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a much higher figure than the 60% limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion more in interest every year," said the Democratic Vice-Chanceller of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that kind of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal State's structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional States, as well as the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 60% as set out in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
A Strong Fuller
Threat note with a new intervention from the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would reinterpret the mark of change if it continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility" in the type of Yen change, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up to a level close to the historical peaks that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold $20 million massively to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually remounting since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these times uncertain world economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar back to be quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has come down below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching a level close to which the last intervention has resulted.
Prior to the financial crisis from 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it strengthens the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues obtained by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the 6th and 11th March tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northest), highlighted Noda, who is afraid that the anchoring of the single root cuts the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", implying that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute of Emissions increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion), bringing the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) to the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags flash
The risk of debt crisis contamination continues to be detrimental to European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European scholarships sink a little further into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3,064 points.
Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions in relation to the performance of the loans of the euro area States most affected, the world's stock markets continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing the market stakeholders' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a range of minor variations, so that investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reopening concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4 per cent.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met at Congress on Monday, adopts a motion that provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types are rising by 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the types of interest of the countries of the south, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of incurring the burden of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10 years' obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the expected growth of 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the number of the second quarter below, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really cares about economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 per cent during the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7. billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will result in the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be an increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which only aims to build centres of the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by quoting some examples, continue to be determined by their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resumed the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
Berlin's election will mean a strengthening of the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, to increase CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
You have to think about Denmark's case.
Europe's energy sector champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours charge an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not at first show opposition to that type of energy, as the surveys show.
We remember that our country's energy policy has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs and 41,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of pymes specialized in international markets and which can create non-replaceable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to function for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, nor is there a diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it did not lead to consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to unforgivable human defects.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electrical players who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, since it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and maneuvers of the party dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "human rights country".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see the release of 23 May) saying in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or comrades".
However, it is rarely examined from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't handle all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish sources.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will enable "migration problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is cost-effectively selectively, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
The fears associated with the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular those who are not qualified, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in jobs in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not satisfy staff demand.
A Positive Effect on Salaries
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between national and immigrant leads to a positive impact on national wages and employment.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of the migration flows would be a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of natural American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization estimates that in Germany an immigrant who is 30 years old will make a net contribution (less cost) of EUR 150,000 to the public average budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These words, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, but it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Coronals in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct manner possible.
We know, from Napoleon, "the Little One," which was a thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become an "oppressive instrument", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek reference had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You have to think about this ambience to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer progressing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in an disorderly manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or a height to the empty nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to get hits of effect, but a common exercise, full of law, quiet and continuous, from options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we did not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is attached to the orders of markets and rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the team from the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, get rid of the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently calling for European economic governance.
That's right.
But thinking about it without a greater political and democratic integration, and without living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new point of death.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with no "contact" chips are generalized
The world chip card room starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end up with an 11% increase in world card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart's cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of wireless technology, which allows you to subscribe to common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year 460 million cards will be sold worldwide with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (preventing 580 million units) and represent around 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been spending a long time on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining land in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their initials are more modest: they are using 400,000 visa cards without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million pass mastercards this year without contact.
In order to make the top move, however, banks need to make it available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have been committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards with the system without contact," said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the middle of the future payment: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), essential for carrying out the transactions.
"They're praying."
"But in order to experience a real increase in the coming year."
"We predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks take the front.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be matched with a foundation that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Argel already "has certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the passageways.
In a restaurant in Niamey by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the wake of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered a number of telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The study of the calls made indicates a number of interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a town in Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must no doubt expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of increasingly complex camikakes or explosive devices and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has been pressuring Abuya ever since to take account of the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a community of illuminators not worthy of interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demanded strict respect for the Sharia, while its militants are being launched in the fight against the central government.
The latter are primarily directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and increased attacks on the commissioners.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 deaths.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in life, received death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern lights.
The past Christmas claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first such.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia passing through Nigeria, concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simple and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidents, voters might think so.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more stringent statements and foreign policy attacks, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans are often unfounded about China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for the manipulation of their currency", a key theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, is almost tired of an attitude that "absolutes" emotions.
He asked for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he gasped.
"If Obama leaves re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he was calling for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capabilities", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
The Governor-in-Chief Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is, for his part, willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also predominates Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to blow the gun in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of Iraq's "boys" and its riots in Libya, and they label it weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, he has been unaware of the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coast, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the valve wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, every year will reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a first wave of 1,224 km that communicate the San Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, the possibility of building a third tube through the same route is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the time-continuation of this huge work presents the areas of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct supply of gas to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
These two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it to close access to Western European markets.
At the point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to triumph its vision of a direct partnership between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," said François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas sector contracts are both political and economical.
All of this explains the wide smiles in the faces of the Gazprom directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-covered steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend the protection measures for fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted all its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided for in Sweden's waters, but the project's managers gave up on the same ground as the Swedishs were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be permanently established in the sea in front of their backs.
"If I had, we would have interrupted the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas of the pipeline will be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a flight will take place, since they have planned joints that, according to the forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, drawn by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device passing through the interior of the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it enters the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible metal distortions.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any type of repair.
The flow of the gas is guaranteed by pressure only.
At first, it is 200 bars and, at the end of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the stakes.
To her, the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented this company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7,400 million for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes the risk of spending on its own.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy shore planted with pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the gas output door.
There are some sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to arrive before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an adventure air, writing hours in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular patches, its rubber, its broken white sheets, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine booklets with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then the consultant of the company, was responsible for launching the new product.
The bookcase is inspired by an ancient production technique, the Skin Mole (top leather), which refers to a painted cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then has become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he made it.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, to a volume of 12,7 million units sold.
Far away has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, their users are cosmopolitans, of open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its start, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks, from Fnac to small shops in the city center, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the increase in e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes from hand to hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own box.
In August, he also launched a cabinet with leopard tapas, due to the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, cylinders, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Synthegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the employment of disabled people starts today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Dissolved?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress made for fifteen years has been considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there's still a lot to be done."
It should be noted that the unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (a 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished the bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the labour world and that "conform the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
These are the target obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; the minds of the people advance, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City pointed out that the directors surveyed had "a level of knowledge about low disability", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we reach around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "subjected to this contribution", as well as the disbursed amounts, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities in their schedule, compared to 82 per cent of enterprises with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
As soon as we face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party creates.
We will not dare to say that there was a coexistence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the corner of the auditorium of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian electorate has no more than praise for him.
"I am so glad for Eden, for his progress and for his Belgian status."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As to the contrast between his presentations on his team and selection, "is a set", he has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget about the "placer."
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
That will certainly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) " , he recalls.
"We just faced it a little while ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Leekens has made a simple reference to the "grogullo" for his part.
"Hungry" for arguing "a gala game."
"Handle" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "wants to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues towards... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal of Paulo Bento faces a great optimism against the return party against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held in Lisbon on Tuesday.
In the party going, they lacked realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Election, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a party to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the date of departure (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but it could not mark the valuable goal that had given it peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, to a public who should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party is "very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Eurocop 2012," said Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's empathies in Bosnia force Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get an empath, but they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, because we haven't marked out," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting a maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning to "don't give them time to think".
A good idea, however, this time, be realistic.
