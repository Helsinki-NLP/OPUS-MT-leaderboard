European inflation declined in food
Accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, is primarily due to the vertebrate increase in the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering, after 2.6 per cent of October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, announced the Union Statistics Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely a 3 percent announced by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike US, British and Canadian issuers, did not share the basic interest, on the assumption that the decline, along with the price increases in raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would result in a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least about two per cent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "there is a need to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
The inflation rate of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, was twelve years; in Spain it increased from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of rising food and energy prices.
Quotas at the end of the wheat increased by 88 per cent and soybean quotations reached their maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased by 52 per cent this year, reaching the black gold almost $100 barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, instead of falling to 1.9 for 2009.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December, the support of the Youth Democratic Alliance increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - about 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's safe voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition voters - would mean support for the more than two-thirds (71 per cent) compared to the support of one-fifth for the Socialists (a 20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit for having a parliamentary stage: their support within the entire population is about two per cent.
Among the safe voters there is one percent more sympathetic on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest - never has been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while 46 per cent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population are facing a deterioration in the situation and only a tenth is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, higher than any previous Gallup survey, believed that the President of the Government was doing better than his duties.
The 13 percent of the consultants trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the consultants.
Approximately 54 per cent of the population do not fully trust the Chief of Government and a 27 per cent do not trust the President of the Youth Democrats Alliance.
One indicator of the political situation's configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Chief of Government without a change in government.
While after October last year's disturbances of 35 per cent believed that it would be desirable to retain the power of the Government and the Chief of Government, this proportion is currently only about 20 per cent, while the relative majority (approximately 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referee is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question of participation replied that they would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said that it is likely to participate.
In a comparable way, "some general elections to be held this Sunday" would certainly involve only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believe that their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
One 74 per cent of the population would deny the payment of study rights, one 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and one 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we only observed these proportions among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment by medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices
They maintained the average increase in prices of 16 per cent of the supermarkets of the Budaörs gold triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of Napi Rajasag
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold triangular trade the usual napi sailing canasta, but in all supermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousands of HUFs.
As in December last year prices had already been "disappeared" in the supermarkets of food, so there was no percentage of drastic anchoring compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUFs, today they cannot do even ten thousand.
The Napi canasta in the surveyed supermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that canasta cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the strawberry, nuts and amapola seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola bottle with two litres was less than 200 HUF, so that this product, including the bottle price, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the canada of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15 while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices in the Napi canasta.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canasta last year with that of the cheapest canasta this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive one this year has been 21 percent.
Average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year prices felt the increase in VAT.
This process was just what destroyed trade, the supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans badly the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose an important benefit in the margin that corresponds to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi canasta reached such extremes due to the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive of 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheaper the difference was only about 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the highest price from now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest has also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared with the two Navigating Seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets more than 30 percent increased the price of first-needed consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi canasta, in this last case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, only 10 percent of the prices were recorded in the worst cases.
According to all indexes, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which can impose the dramatic increase in prices even for multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain about the commercial triangle of gold, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three visited stores are no longer interested in prices.
Out of all products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three shops formed large queues in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that within the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because incomes are below their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year thousands of infections have been reported in hospitals primarily due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The health conditions prevailing in hospitals, bed care and staff overload do not favour the control of infections - says the head medical department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, even the disinfectants are saved.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumaology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital early in the year.
A serious car accident hit him from the hospital, and the same patient had to return to the hospital soon after being infected with MRSA and since then had not been able to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered - said Karolina Böröcz, head of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals with all safety, this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has been recorded, but no information is available.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry in their nose the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria without causing any disease.
Infections caused by the SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of the wound) respond well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once too much or improperly applies to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into very resistant bacteria and are rapidly infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
Severe hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicemia, may be caused primarily by patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with the weakened body, elderly or persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the medical director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff care for them in rubber and mask gloves and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even this way the infection can be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and isolate immediately the patients who carry the MRSA in their body.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, there is no fashionable taking of microbiological samples.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come out in public light when the presence of visible MRSA infections in the patient already occurs - said the head doctor of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to deal with infections and pathological pictures.
Antibiotic therapy should be pursued, or microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent resistance to medications, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are still less frequent in the case of patients on the outpatients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that, in most cases, MRSA is contacting one patient through healthcare staff.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drops and direct contact between individuals, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often covered, the beds are often very close, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it is also possible to experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic conditions, there are few nurses and many patients, and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge cost to the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme seems to have success, according to the data provided, the infections with MRSA show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholism of the police commander causing a fatal accident
The special official report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the district XXII.
It can be excluded from the possibility that he would lead a drunk or in a troubled state that since then left the commander of the police of the district XXII, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a transeont - informed Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Capital Attorney General's Office, after having prepared the special report on the case.
The special report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholism that it had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station in the district of XXII, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle, as he doubled the Kossuth Lajos street of the district of XXII, struck a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian area.
(This last fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not attenuating circumstances, the driver should always step down as he doubles.)
The transeont lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police report, because he was greatly moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Research Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander had been working with the investigators in charge of the investigation since the beginning.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance educational, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the transport and environmental projects in the Hungarian budget, which will be made from the Cohesion Fund subsidy, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract that they have just signed relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The €150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose in Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be made later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which will be used primarily for the project of innovation and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that when Hungary lasts with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro will again deal with the subject that if the original contract is necessary or not, and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charging commissions for maintaining the loan at the debtor's disposal.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed to that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buy even cheaper in the EU market, will soon be anchored?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgarian, with its cheap apartments of ski trails and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pampropo and Vitosa are the most popular, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also be of interest to real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap Russian area.
Likewise, Sofia's capital, commercial spaces and offices can be attractive, promising a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a marked destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, pre-empted investors are already making their purchases, for example in the area of Bansko.
In the opinion of the analysts, who buy furniture in Bulgaria, they also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and on ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to be installed here buy new or renovated buildings at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad shape between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and they also care for the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category is the chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of Germany).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope that they will benefit in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is constantly growing, as demand is growing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent.
The increase in the price of buildings significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fódor and the six per cent Hungarians
According to the Minister of the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the ministerial negotiations on the international climate regime beyond 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Balí Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are lively discussions on the particular situation between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate precise figures, although it tends to agree that, in comparison with the 1990 situation, by 2020, the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to provide material and technological assistance to the countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be headed by a steering board composed of 16 members, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes "Piac es Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its avant-garde role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU undertakes to reduce by 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, by 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to undertake to decrease even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to accept commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within that period the 15 EU Member States committed to meeting 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by about 6 per cent over the period from 1985 to 87, which our country will meet - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a lot of what is at stake in Balí, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, which was notified in its most recent report by the ICCC, the UN's international scientific association dealing with climate change, which received the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and no more than 2°C of the average Earth temperature could be prevented, as scientists believe it would have irreversibly and irreversibly consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings about actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos on their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers that have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the British Community (Commonware Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence, they also served to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment televisions - told BBC the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, they inevitably have some political message, as they in a specific way justify the reason for the military action decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the tapes that are carefully edited and censored, there are also popular videos in the distributor, such as about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers speak as much of a loss, but do not present the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded from the battle fields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with video shooting games, which are free of charge, called America's Army, in which, in the midst of a more or less real situation, the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and pastel salad in the Christmas party of ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salad and coffee pastel.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the navigable atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a thumb and a toast.
Feast, Christmas environment, concerts and buffets - so you share power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas festival will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts at the Christmas of the Huerfans and for the Christmas of the Missionors are invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will target 25 million for the festive environment of the end of the year.
The National Funding Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the festivals of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the 60 employees of the ministry expected to be around thirty-five.
In the portfolio party you will reign a Christmas environment, perform artists as well, and there will be a score.
The ANF fleet cost 4,700,000 HUF and held Wednesday in the National Justice Board (CNAJ) building with music concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the employees of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party, which will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
Can attend without clothing
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF festival, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated Lucía's dance on December 7th.
The CNAJ of them charged nothing for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The festival began with the Minister's greeting words and after dinner there was dancing music live.
Answering the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
The health, work and local administration portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a festival for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the minister of work Monika Lamperth is not waiting for his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
It is with the participation of a hundred and eighty guests who - as I told the press department - will only take coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply provide his colleagues with the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development class.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Navigating Festival in its own Chamber of Acts with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay for the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will not be a festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only for the ministerial discourse but also for the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20th, Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and as the portfolio reported, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception of foot, to which only qualified diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief speech of the Minister's greeting and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the relevant press departments told [origin].
In the environment portfolio press department, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Navigating Celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are meeting
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will be a strike committee on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
A half of the protest will take place on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the labour force will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be stopped completely and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be in strike for up to 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
It will also be the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machinery Union which will coordinate Monday's actions.
A half protest will be held on Saturday, as on Monday, the participating trade unions will strike for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report on the date of the start of the strike.
If the National Assembly rejects public health law, the trade unions will withdraw their appeal immediately to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law at the very hours of the night, or at the best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the interurban transport of buses from Volan will appear.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a defined time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of the Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach agreement on the minimum services, although, as Christmas parties are approaching, more and more people are traveling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike at the LIGA Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy Trade Unions, the Educators' Trade Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Educators' Union.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be held in a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSS) which are part of the Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the Government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new method of calculating pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions, the occupations that take place may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gitan population in Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke an event of this nature - he added the representative of the research institute.
They said that all of this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political life leaders: "The public life actors gave the public debate of the Gitan problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing disparities between the Gypsy and the Hungarians."
This increases the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of outbreaks of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the Institute of Research, the National Guard's activity, as a result of the high attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the country's stability and democratic development".
They remind us that, from the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicized and stimulated, and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been formed in the country, which are self-defined by "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they self-define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, public order defense), giving support to the ineptities of the police, the army, that is, the state" - add.
They said that all of this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
It can highlight civil society and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of the neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Institute of Research, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way as for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gypsys that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to be the guardian, arguing that the objective of the organization was "the national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gitanian terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained powerless and indifferent in the face of the facts - he recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations, which some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced to resist, will be their own guardian.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász said that the news agency's question was: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as it did in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party doesn't always write with red numbers
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America, the parties are united.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between a national party, a state party and a festive day.
The festive days are essentially related to religious festivals and historical ephemerides.
We also celebrated the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - this last one in particular so that you can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven events written with red numbers in the calendar.
It was a national celebration on 15 March in memory of the 1848 and 23 October, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November, we reminded our families and friends of their failures.
In addition, there are two days of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas in our country.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the festival there is only one working day.
In exchange for the weekend so extended, you cannot leave work or school on the previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day immediately before or after the festival.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and services institutions that, because of their role, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December practically life is stopped in the country, as according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with averages or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be modified around the working party so that the workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the festival of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year may rest, since it will not work anywhere from 24 December, or even on the last day of the year will be a Wednesday.
Six little dissuasives to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing them: they are all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to the small troubles or deliberately avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been looking for you from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a date?
In the best case you feel it and try to fix the matter, you best call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
It is worth meditating on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and conscious effort to avoid them.
Did you borrow something that wasn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
You remember you put the grabbing on the table yesterday, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost handwriting on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they're gonna be mad at you for distracting their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before the time.
Are you talking about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Don't pass to everyone the information you have about your colleagues' particular life!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares with you his most intimate secrets!
You will understand in yourself what you have heard and don't joke about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know the things of him.
Are you getting a license for sickness unfairly?
When you call the office by phone and you say you're sick and you're unbearably hurt your head, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; you think that others should do your job, your unbearable tasks, your job at the end.
Don't give a shit about your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicable, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but do you suddenly get rid of him the jokes of your colleagues?
Have you heard an involuntary phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to her?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, voice conversations (less when you do them above your head), patals, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontents in a loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not call the chaos that may reign in the office, nor the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must fix the lack!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Very comfortable for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Don't look at a comfortable jogging even though your occupation allows it!
Don't be disappointed, respect your colleagues and yourself by seeing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
Losing interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car moves slowly in the usual morning grip.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tone add the low and then the voice of a female choir as a true joy intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
National music life didn't hurt us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems completely different when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appeared. Some new and interesting songs of the subground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although the rock style garage is fashionable again, guitar break, the national pop electro has shown: there are new things under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi group until he started his independent career maybe because they can't both be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danced electronic music and pop, he tried to win, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Törek Szezon).
The wider audience knew the whole that in principle acted only in small clubs when the magazine van2 selected its first album edited in 2002 among the 50 most important national discs, grading Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to be sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked you whether they carry this label or not.
The set reacted how it should react: it prepared a new disc and even better.
The recently launched disc, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference on the air, on the flight, but in addition to the air of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the era - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the set The Puzzle.
The disc includes a real success of Mr2 Petõfi channel, which last comes from the morning to the night of popular music. This station led up to the ears of the radio players the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Well, it's all in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: What are you interpreting, to what extent is music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of the selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called underground alternative music can also be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years are frequented, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you're losing interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made his career better west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work on the team, trust the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At one point it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of Mr.2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in relation to this song.
Did you deliberately open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these successes our disk.
This song is more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavyest themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why, exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists with a good voice from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - either Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as God of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you actually compose the song or the girls have changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the disc, we thought that something was still missing.
The agreement attracted the singing.
Still that night I recorded the song the girls later learned.
It came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divines.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the disc it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short only), they do not have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music does not just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the bottom just because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we deliberately did not want to distribute soloists' papers.
The song also reads about it, about which we forget a moment of our ego, the one from where it came and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would have wanted to make it possible for others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What more work have you dedicated to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, but at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert plan or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little, everything went to his place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I've already released the disc.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A stockbroker risks thousands of millions for its inferiority complex
A wicked traitor.
This is how your former employee Jerome Kerviel, the French banker of Société Générale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself with his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He intruded long ago, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media move, such as Le Monde's newspaper, is that it was a man who had a profit of more than EUR 1,600 million at the end of last year because of his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank" he assured in his answers.
It was precisely in the summer that he was able to win during the US crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity had already come early in the year.
In February, some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I've won my first 500 million, I don't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses, adding, that nothing has been left for him at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had faked the records in such a way as not to reach his discovery.
He even got to deceive the bosses, even when the Eurex Bolsa began to be interested in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Did he have to find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much strength of will to risk it like that?
I had to work gradually in my position.
He joined the General Society in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later, he was an associate of the Bolsa runner and in 2005 he became a scholarship runner with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that I was being watched carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But the first great success came soon from my entry into the company.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a low title of EUR 500 million.
And this was supposed to be a start-up mechanism, and I wanted to do more.
If you want, let's leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it.
"While he was earning money, his eyes were closed."
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend to mid-January, I wanted to delete every trace.
When Monday came to work, I wasn't working at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacations.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to reach 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion).
It is practically half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be available for the regions.
The Czech companies can obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources available to the Czech Republic from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures, which will account for 90,800 million crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources for business innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least-used newly-income countries.
Twenty-year-old penalty for the Nicaraguan president, the court ruled
The Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal decreed on Thursday the 20-year penalty for the country's spokesman, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the decommissioning of $100 billion (approximately 1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to pass home arrest on his farm not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
There is nothing clear at this time, according to AP agency that then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in ranks.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, he will depend more on the prison officials if they allow Germany to end his sentence at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Germany constantly transferred government money to a company in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and partners.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how we got the budget approved.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's confidence vote, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, calmly passed the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it conceals the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats have suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 cannot be so easily resolved:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called the expenses of the mandate holders who are not only pensioners but also the social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the economic deficit as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money taxes, fees and bank credits, often issued disproportionately obligations with which they disproportionately owed to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks that have received from the state and privatisation.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we take into account only the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is called ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for your government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be in debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been in vain in recent years with enormous measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if not soon the retirement age and pension reform will then be the end of any policy in this country and, the government who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
A little bit of an exaggeration we can say that politicians who rule will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money for retirement taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on normal expenditures of the mandaters.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted over the past ten years what they could have done.
We do not want politicians who rule to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and taxes, the calmness for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make it possible to achieve a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Market, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders, banks undermine the types of interest for which they are able to lend money.
For example, American Fed will send to bid $40 billion, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital gap that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers, Economic Outlook Group consultant.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on loans committed, especially in the United States.
Economists are still waiting for billions of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what they are waiting for when they decided to take this step," said ABN's chief economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same access problems to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they could not reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London Interbank rate used for the interbank loan.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of lending money even when the U.S. Central Banks, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop of interest," said the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologist's debates are incredible
Global climate change is particularly affecting developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed himself with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue book, not a green planet, he commented that the debate of environmentalists is incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are only structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I find myself often only with the cartoon of my ideas."
Interested people can now be informed about their diverse views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough supposed to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized desertion, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his view that the climate was constantly changing and that its changes were normal, that there was no agreement between scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes were not so great and serious, nor were possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development were useless, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental militants who do not consider the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same theme in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't get to change their meat to drive
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old flesh to drive whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials can get them to the end of the year to issue the new meat.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without a valid meat.
According to traffic, the meat has not changed mainly those who don't even want to drive.
While peoples announce a rapid decline in meat exchange, metropolis offices are full of requests and interest in the new meat has increased.
The Townhouse calculates about 2,000 clients daily.
There's a half an hour waiting in the queues.
The new carnage has not yet been removed in Prague by some 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new meat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid meat will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative breach, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the previous information, a fine could be received by that person who is not going anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, as a maximum.
According to the spokesman for the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousands of crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving sheep is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the meat of identity that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over the meat to drive.
Just bring it or send it by e-mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meat issued during 1964 and 1993 ceased to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of meat to drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty for Berdich's complicit detectives
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a final verdict the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The department's detectives were fighting organized crime, and in principle, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision, it is no longer possible to resort, only through the revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this accused case but he first expects the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In spite of this, a total of 16 years has already been sentenced in other proceedings.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 persons and the higher court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused's accusations were rejected by the investigation because of the alleged cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdich passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft and Opava and Konňarík.
The charge refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, stole them tens of millions of crowns.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other indictees guilty.
Other men related to the Berdich case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pôt and Maroš Shulej, who for the time being have avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital in Trebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in accordance with the Veleba proposal.
"That request we do not approve, it is too high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"In order for us to have an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counter-party has sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a ransom value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal highlighted.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablon’s family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that it was developed in the hospital of Motol faculty in Prague.
Children's parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they fought with reprisals for the change of girls.
Women bring him worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Maternity House of Trebič last year, December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and the Čermákový and Jajbyslavic, and Veronica and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablonj.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed in the hospital of Trebič administered by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In the event of errors, they should be removed from the reserve fund and may exceptionally ask for help from the administrator.
The court so far recognized them as a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and exceptionally one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Kingdom brand Valaquia.
According to Ostrava's provincial court judge, he was the first to use the Kingdom brand of Valaquia, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš who the actor collaborated with.
Polivka did not present itself today in oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are some parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years of work.
Looking for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I realized that the project was successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polívka on its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him to the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia was published in Haraish.
From that comical source, it resulted in a profitable business and business activity from which Haraish created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of its name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors from its farm and visitors to its shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also today determined that Haraish only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project, there is Harabiš and his team who were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, among the discomposed parties today, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, conflicts have begun between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination has come with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the elected for ever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, came to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother Queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Haraish and his society that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could lead to the fight, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Haraish.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to disclose any more data or dates.
"We don't have any rush.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king should be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself" Haraish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Overcoming prejudices
To tell the truth, I've never liked Peugeot 206 too much.
Its walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, manoeuvre and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market your successor, Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's carriage means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I walk through the interior quickly to not repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times where we complained about short seats and supports.
Also, unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi, the so-called lack of space in the head disappears.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This must be valued as very accessible (through the rear abatable port) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber belts that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But we stayed in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic regime has a capacity of 428 litres, which compared to competition is rather a mean value.
But not in comparison with the same type of vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that Peugeot stays in the bag with its 52 liters perceptible.
From vacations abroad or when placing the child's car its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that's pretty flat after the back of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four valve injection fire on a capacity of 1.6 l and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how it's supposed to look like a 1600 that would underestimate the family's five doors.
It's silent, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the damage from then it seemed as if the escape tube was stuck by a trap, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with an injection fire of 1400 for 329,900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates have put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Just that we would still have airbag in our heads, air conditioning, automatic cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's with the team's complements in the Fabia and it's going to reach a pretty similar number.
Now it's just left to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not join English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and for this reason, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between the natives and the Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, exorcism and bronze between students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam's police arrested a Slovak woman who was holding sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her child with racist tone insults.
The police also had to act after a two-year-old attack against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls made fun of him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave it, he made us the breath of throwing us butter and pears, and then he put down his pants and showed us his back," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be fulfilled, if you choose correctly.
Plays arenas and golden, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and everything included with cameras offering pizzas on the beach, ice creams or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the Great Antilles islands.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 20s.
He ordered to build one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was about crime in the U.S. (and therefore forbidden) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, along avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had its yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left its signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians of all America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the price Hotel Nacional mixes the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars have been cultivated since the 1950s, so far they continue to work by Havana, because those La La Lada and Fiat who have been here for a long time have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even when La Habana, in particular the old neighborhood, is deteriorating significantly, there are no such wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and that is highly appreciated by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow routes in steam or electric machines.
His cars for decades have not been discovered and are now there, machines that work, and whose brothers' models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And that's why you don't have to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember, in Hemingway's already mentioned farm, there is a museum that for those who love the writer, they should not stop visiting him.
The Vignales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rocks.
Mogots, chalice rocks and high-stranded rocks in the valleys, and in their caves acclimatized fertile lands thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure haganera factories can be found with your final product.
It may seem interesting to someone that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was surrounded there.
Trinidad
Old town of boredom that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the later French settlers, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so narrow that in the 50s last century there was no road that would unite it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one evening, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas such as the Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by its own path.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that only knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as Humanity Heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Colon (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Café, ron, pure, Sierra Maestra, the Cochinos Bay and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan was not as expected, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country met in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, the eight participating States today discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase their activity, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they can only start economic and security development," said the BBC Minister of Defence, Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to US military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in 27 per cent, and in Helmand province up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of whom the fourth is in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the conclusion of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the participating countries in the past few months, there has been debate as to whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for its passive nature.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a minimum area of violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in our, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun called the German soldiers blind this week.
"The Afghan rebels find that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing the tennis table.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a Rugby party in southern Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will reach the bill in 2009
For each Czech country, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842,700 million crowns in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159,200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew to 842,700 million crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13,400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its debt status data in early October.
For each of the Czechs, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State has owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
The next year the debt should move between the 900,000 million and the billion crowns," said to the iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees this: "We could spend the bill in 2009.
That is exactly when it will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If the situation in the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed in 2010.
But I don't see that change," he added.
Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debt in the central government and arises above all from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew from 38.500 million to 719,400 million crowns this year.
The external debt for the time being has grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The debt of the state negotiable at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced to 13,700 million crowns.
The average payout of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interim debt of the first to the third quarter created 13 percent, which is enormously given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better Than What You Expect
From the government's payment and debt management strategy for 2007, it is apparent that this year the government planned to borrow 159.200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152,800 million crowns due to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount consists, in particular, of the deficit in the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of the maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with around 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance the state's obligations and 1,800 million crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank loans.
He compared today in front of a court in Khartoum to have given a name to a bear
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court of Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expelled, he indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students between 6 and 7 years of age give the name of Mahomet to a male bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was a sin of latex.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been detained on Sunday in his home and accused of assaulting Islam and sedentary, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to the month of September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the pelvic bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " , the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children from every 23 have chosen Mohamed as the preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the next legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be offensive to a religious faith, "I just feel that he has asked the children to vote for a name " , it is according to him only to a " innocent error " .
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " who never speaks of religion in class."
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished their Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not expect violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, which regroup the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from here to 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last of the negotiations since the troika had been tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this summit.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Kartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the UN in Kosovo, the West consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced Kosovo's president of the autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel, where these "opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has contributed to its weights.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
"Effect domino"
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a commitment always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade says in particular to fear a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia " , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted for two years.
It must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of Albanian independence would be " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the conference of international peace convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
It was necessary that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to enter into immediate negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them to conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling their obligations to the peace-building itinerant in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim to " conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This designation covers the three main problems of the quarrelsome point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deeper" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, quoting "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
Going back to the court, Olmert committed himself to making future negotiations "direct and continuous" and to doing "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of its " vision of two " Palestinian and Israeli States coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this sense by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, led by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a confrontation point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Saudi in his Arabic periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What just happened last Sunday?
As often as in this kind of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the French National Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Louisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but in patrol, and he was traveling 40-50 km/h, without a turning beam " , explains a police source.
A green motorbike of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulate " to all gas " .
" He hit the police car on the left, after a failure of the front step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcohol applied to the occupants of the vehicle has been shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front degrounded, parabrised, booted parachoks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly last morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary murder and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the departmental management of the public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that IGPN's investigation at this stage was disposing of police responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who understood Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, to know that this minimotocycle had reached their left relatively quickly " .
Yesterday, a kind of ranura, no doubt caused by the flotation of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, which says the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing support to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also separate " any serious defect " from this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, which must be very careful about, " , required a police source.
Liberation found an eye witness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that just gives the scene.
"We went down then, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw " a completely disappointed police officer, who was squeaking.
Two others were trying to reinvigorate one of the young, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems certain that the people were present in the unexpected situation of young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, reliefs always arrived " about twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not assist young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombers arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension goes up in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed Monday's first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter replicationd with stone shots, wounding the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests in the course of the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (norwest).
The movement of lawyers gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president " urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the losses they had sworn in front of Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the exception declared on Saturday afternoon.
I had to speak in the next few days about the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we see is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's failures," the magistrate declared in The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president " no longer values " after the establishment of the state of emergency, he declared Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that it would leave its military uniform here on 15 November, the date of the end of its first presidential mandate.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government rejected insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the army.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or accidental births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of three (36%) is not planned, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or accidental births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better " fertility domain " , according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 was from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of every five and if possible for the spring, a season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of work in space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a decommissioned and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness of the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece to welcome the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see boxed).
This module is a type of landfill for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electric production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, has been damaged in a little bit more or less than a meter by a wire that stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first had to perform a control output of the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to the end of the 30 metres length of the teledirectional arm of the launcher added to the station to perform the repair.
It's one of the best spacewalker (space walker) in NASA.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "heired".
After carefully inspecting the damage, he sectioned the defective cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped the second spacewalker who had stayed close to the exclusive air and, from within, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool used, a hockey minibaston wrapped with insulators to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapped" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher for the expected return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctions in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the air and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with delays in the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been required to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to the delays caused by the slow development of the engine of A400M, which adds to the aeroplane's inaugural flight.
The cost of halting the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, rises " between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the European manufacturer's mother's house EADS.
Because of these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new targets for the 2007 exploitation result (EBIT) during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds no more accurate accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No one is surprised on Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending the voters today a television message on public chains, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory appears overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to hand over a new burden to the accused West of interference - his theme of prejudice during the campaign.
" We know the price of real democracy and we want honored, more transparent and more open elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Report a pressurized campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the world of Jaquel Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
After these legislative elections, there are no surprises about two more open questions:
Who will happen to Putin’s presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008 and the candidates have until 23 December to get to know each other.
elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is the leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful Russian party united that would elect the government and the president?
Either way, legislative elections as well as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet man, do not feel the owners of his destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, from the state university in St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a populist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic downturn " , estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " give up their own personal responsibility " by their own will " of those who had recently been tested after the outbreak of the USSR.
"For what reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social levels, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians, they will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "What to reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi files, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are available free of charge.
The 47 million files, stored over 27 km away in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not even available here for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nomineely, at the request of an old victim or his rightholders.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for searches " particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files administered by the International Red Cross Commission (ICRC).
In recent years, several States, such as Germany, have opposed the public opening of these nominations because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Just like the alleged homosexuality or the mental hangicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the aliens deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to give them proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are still dealing with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now about €60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free exchange agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner pointed out to Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nat.
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had last given their approval to the European Commission in April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to the figures of the European Commission.
" A free exchange pact will cover a lot of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. Asian and European giants change annually by " EUR 47 billion of goods " and by " EUR 10 billion of services ", said Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned on Thursday to alleviate the current return on credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the base index of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , states in a statement.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 1215 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
This is the first time the UK bank seems to place liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain interbank loans per day with its basic index.
The daily interbank index was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important criminality index that has deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the euro-related book change, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny consideration of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre Group refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is equivalent to a depreciation of the text.
As part of a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including an increase of 50 % of the employment surplus, the restoration of the TIPP (in-house charge for oil products), a check-transport or the rent restrictions.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the review of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was raised at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft law on rectification finance reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current movement of the festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 entrusted Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, she took the lead in the United Kingdom Reading Festival, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Ben added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Ben has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of " more inspiring event " he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stand in low-class policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that will last take place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the festival Lollapalooza in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded their gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a camp festival, while ours are done better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to simultaneously give a impression of camp festival in the European and urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vienna community, including the mayor, is eager to support the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims " that they are quite interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", for example, of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
It says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but music will vary there, with the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 companions who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movies to Montreal when nothing else than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Race for Festivals
At the moment, the priority of Denis Turcotte is despite the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oskars race is beginning.
All the festivals in the West Coast, which are the one in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that the performers do interviews.
The Age of Shadows had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on a poster to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short-terms to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the bag? Experts, divided by the crisis 'subpress'.
Less than five weeks to cancel the closing of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands, hoping that the traditional rally will arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in a bag usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made based solely on statistics, even because, in the current context, uncertainty exists in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not parties to the fact that the stock exchange in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leaking effect on quality values in both long and short frames".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "particularly because it is not known the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types, given the high level of cruelty and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
Ibex has lost close to 4% of the peaks marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Not all experts still have this negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year as close as 16,000 points thanks to portfolio restructuring and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert argues that things will be slightly different this year as he believes that the rally will move forward on the second week of December, after the constitutional bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the trend of the market.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banko, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a decline in the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the U.S. about the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these are positive.
Analysts agree with the time to choose the values to be taken to Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversi Banko, ensures that the rise will come from the bank's hand and industry.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally, if given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explained.
cyclic consumption will be a major in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the November sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has been a month.
The actual end-of-year rally was lived in 2003, the exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the paint of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent return.
You will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (Ibex is currently up 8.36% since January) and if you can count on its end-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew most of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open the Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the popular experience will be decisive for other entities to focus on this initiative, or not, as a result of trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that pursues Popular with the project.
Catch the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the pymes, autonomouss and trades of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the clients of the various streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, even if a larger recruitment of staff, since it involves having about six local employees to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for the SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Via de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be quite right, according to Rivero.
People currently have 2,500 branches.
And other 60 that operate under the Mondocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations, the BBVA model will not be repeated, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in your rival's Antenna 3
We got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with Paolo Vasile, the deputy councillor of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antenna 3.
It was just one aspect of his joy: 'that's what I'm sorry about, it's not because we've grown more than because we've gone down less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 per cent advance.
That profit puts its loss on what we've been carrying in the year at 15.66%.
The value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) and participating by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antenna 3, which last night surrendered 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million Prisa (Fifth Days Editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that it was planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, the deputy adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this reported data were to be made, the TV chain would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising bill for the 2006 fiscal year.
Antenna 3 net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that points analysts to the best relative evolution in Telecinco's bag is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave our shareholders happy, which we have already given value to by 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at these moments of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It should be explained that the expected growth of income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same signature has reduced Antenna’s profit forecast by 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary procedure, which came to an end today with the vote by the Congress on amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and consensualize the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and regular entities' activities for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, represents the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fosters cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to both specialized and legal firms and create a new type of financial services signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join value companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of financial instruments operating systems, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral negotiating systems and internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services undertakings to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they perform, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
A number of amendments were introduced in the course of the Congress' Economic Commission, which highlights that the debt securities titled are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been shown by the US high-risk mortgage debt (subpress).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that diplomats may have in Economics and Enterprises 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work abroad, will not require the authorisation of CNMV and may provide its product marketing and customer capture services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the European Union's inflation rate calculation, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the user for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to be consistent with the final data, which will be made available on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The Vice-President of the Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise in a 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at " relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in Congress's corridors that "even though the figure is not good" the difference between Spain's inflation in terms of monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there had been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," said the Minister of Economy regarding the advanced data today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he had collected a record deposit of over 25 billion pounds, a figure that had fallen gradually in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of a hundred of that money offered by the Government and which would last until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank revenues that are deposited in the next three years to get those 18 billion remaining pounds to reach the goal of 30,000 million.
The Group of the Magnet Richard Branson, known for its so-called advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from the bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has now stopped at the first hour of the morning to the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats of the Consistency and the Head of Police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular MP, and until then the governor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER chain, it could be the 'head' of this plot.
The officers continue to record the municipal units and the urban council and no more detentions will be thrown out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the chief suspect of the urbanist corruption plot, was charged at the beginning of this week.
As the SER chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, for so short, stopped him from leaving the Morales home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to the sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions instead of facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a galley construction company to re-equate 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's candidacy by Toledo and preside over Congress if they win
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOEs by Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the secretariat of the WHOE Organization, José Blanco, and Bono itself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to count with the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "if it seems" the Manchego politician will be the candidate for the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress with Manuel Marín, who announced last November his decision not to submit to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change in the university field.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting on his return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, as citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If you reach the position, Bono expects to convert the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry". and make it "appears more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes regrettably, the only place in Madrid where you can't talk peacefully and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and he has not wanted to see himself occupying his position no longer to fall into what, he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unmistakably persecution, both to the skeptics of their predictions and to those who prioritise other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why the action, or the inaction, of your Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in the implementation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the failure, in which sectors have occurred, and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with utmost clarity what measures are being taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, whoever's going to be sacrificed and who's going to pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, discomforts and threats to business accounts and individuals.
Even the centenium of the gas suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new duties.
With contracts with the planet, that lord is so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but he loves myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the abanique.
Arrested by the mayor and chief of the local police in Totana for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the City Council Secretary and a host businessman for possible urban offences, have today reported sources of research.
The edil was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, where he is currently located with numerous agents, who have also visited the Urban Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalculation of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanization so that the galega Nuaria will build 4,000 housings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not detained but were charged in the summary, which instructed Judge No. 1 of Totalana.
The first six detainees have now passed to court.
According to sources, the former governor of Totana and today the EP's autonomous parliamentary, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, who owns a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businesswoman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Ponteverra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonaur, an agency integrated into the above-mentioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Central Operational Unit (UCO) Urban Crimes Group, whose agents, in addition to detentions, have practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a highly-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "space".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autessa and Inomoyar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the extensive parking of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando El Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

If it seems to them, we will let the Book of the Month rest, see if in the meantime there is another 'premiology' and other powers.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important journal (by the way, in the head of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the very day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the Blackburn book:
"The content of Philosophy's signature has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the death, a bachelor student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and of Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor responsible for the Philosophy assignment, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be punishable by six months a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs in the store at a value of less than EUR 400, you are simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in the shop, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the charge to download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains below that of the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous kidney has a penalty of three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months a year two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth, someone is walking his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor handed me one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activity, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if when they both got the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if it required so much science to conclude this.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years persecuting the Balkan war criminals implicitly from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agricult taste, because the chief responsible for the killing of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, continue to be released.
Its names are in that list of which he takes his title from the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not abroad in Spain), who, with the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue fugitive criminals and pressure the Governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance do I need?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible signs, is an important cost that will depend on several factors, such as age, sex, the age of the meat, the civil status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insured person.
This commitment is materialized in a insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for the liability for the payment of the compensation in the case of sine.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the meat, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, more likely to pay.
That is why both the 25-year-old and the women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of illiteracy due to their caution.
The company has also concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or more types of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with a number of disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the old age of the meat.
While the ideal for being well assured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most cautious drivers can choose for a whole risk with frankness, so that they can obtain the coverages of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This kind of agreement would assume that the customer pays part of the amount of the sine.
"The share of the amount of the customer's contribution will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be the higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest manager in Spain of First Europe, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid sinisters as much as possible, as this will affect the benefit, reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction on the company's base rate.
On the contrary, criminalization is a charge on that basic tariff.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and on its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it may be possible to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
Over the last 25 years, drivers have the easiest time to hire insurance, as the index of mishap is reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a whole risk with frankness.
"Of course, young people can't use the experience previously acquired in the time of an accident, and even in the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'innovation medium' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows, it is clear.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower index of systolicity, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk (may be EUR 300), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one at thirds of the vehicle's life extended from the third year of life.
"They conduct a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to take on a greater amount of frankness," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, it is advisable to cover all risks with frankness (as at EUR 150), or one to third extended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible signs, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic search for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the 'Champions' league, as Italians serve them to be the first and the Scottish to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified their passage on the fifth day with an empathic in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go ahead.
These two parties of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to dispute the World Clubs in Japan, where it starts on the 13th day in semifinals in search of a square by the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and empathies in Giuseppe Meazza seem to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to mirror at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in October.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could serve him even a defeat to be classified if the Shakhtar didn't win, but can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scottishs, who trust to move in eights for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consistently, after being precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the journey.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar only worth the triumph, in the event that Celtic loses, both to join the eighties and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and no choice to follow in the highest European competition, could achieve the third place with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first round since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group meeting is "bright".
About 20,000 people exhausted the entrances to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes the EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage lighting some bracelets that had given them the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that surrounded GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
In front of the show's start, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "has not seen our dress for anything, so I'm nervous about what's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose release in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fifth two years later, also expressed her nervousism during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
"The room's scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I've made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been settled and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
At his arrival at the airport, they were expecting an army of babies.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4,) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of exports of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced the supply to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolies of the gas, Gazprom, trying to wake up the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would charge Ukraine more, as it has committed itself to paying 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine could pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations from Central Asia.
NHS "will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees outside Europe, a guard said.
The recommendation of general auditor Robert Black came after it was proved that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the number of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area as a result of attacks at the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the doors of the terminal building of the airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Great Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should follow the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we have found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign staff of the NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying which employees have unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreign pre-employment policy and guidance in the NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I was very interested in this work as a result of the terrorist attack at the Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider reporting recommendations and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film on Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, director Anton Corbín and co-participator Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control continues to rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - that has the sound band of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds.
But also the Dutch photographer Corbín, already known by the iconic character of the album Joshua Tree of U2, won with two prizes – to the best director and best starting director.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer, won the best documentary award.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a leader of the Russian mob in London, in the movie by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received Richard Jarris' award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the sequence of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Cave".
Winston said he was proud to receive that award, so appointed in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"They were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa festival's sympathizers and mechanists include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrested 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world's largest oil supplier state television said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
The supporters of Al-Qaeda have set up a campaign against local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-military cell formed by foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the province of the East, the TV reported.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Minister of the Saudi Interior, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by an "expert on missile launch", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the entry by smuggling eight projectiles to the country.
Other 22 of the detainees were planning killings by religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting the Saudis travelling to Iraq to join as militants in Al-Qaeda to fight the allied forces and to support the Shiita Muslim government, which is considered to be the heir to the most extreme Saudi Sunny.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the real family, which dominates the government.
The militants, who were gathered by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to attack the pro-Western government of the country, had as their goal foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a great effort of the security forces for five months ago," the spokesperson for the interior minister said on state television.
The detainees also include a "mediate cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of the radical Suni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of supporting and financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship in orbit showed the planet more like a gem of the Earth than it had previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had similar conditions to what made the Earth a inhabited planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is frustrated by hurricane winds and rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a picture of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from Earth, when two planets are similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scene in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decommissioned "riched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was decommissioned yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cashier could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy of presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, Republican presidential candidates may have access to a discussion on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them to their distribution among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November were more ridiculous than the one of the snow mono that asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party's face to the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show applicants to aspire.
But the first half of the debate, the longest devoted to one theme, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas that they would like to hear: the issuers noted approval points when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a scorer in Iowa and New Hampshire's crucial surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to gain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they were both alerted to the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed to say that Jesus was too intelligent as to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two have left the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the size of America, meeting both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have been sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor do they smell extramarriage fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy business man has disbursed contributions to the British Labour Government party, over 650,000 pounds (1.3 million) of sterling, for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced him.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister chose to appeal to an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by stating that the polls did not influence its decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with increasing intelligence, because the frightened Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put the business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chapter.
A third of retired generals started a riot in the Lores Chamber, protesting against military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term job.
Now it's David Abrahams' multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary-General (and former associate) has already quit.
None of this means that Mr Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach an inflexible point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their integrity when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, which he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as an officer of the hero.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's contract periods - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one's been killed, no one's been robbed directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be the case, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, whom he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the large amount of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in the decision-making process by a family matter, a committee of inquiry on the matter - conducted, to a good extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morality is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Commission on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months and must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require a thorough cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a participant such as Mr Brown.
But he has to deal with some partying facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probability and solid competition.
Tiburone card
Is the mortgage crisis suppressing the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal fins don't get excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the credit card market in the country.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis suppresses other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are already seen.
There is an increase in card charges as well as in crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Mortality and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the rate of delinquency of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. People's Failure Act (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in failure requests, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of morbidity) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for the lenders were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between sub-prime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But credit card issuers see more liquidity flow than active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily change the creditors' ability.
They can even work to benefit the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing mortgages will decrease if the properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions as mortgage lenders, changing types of interest or changing creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset withdrawal.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden sub-prime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and credit contractions push America to recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal wings.
British bankers convicted of enron
Three British bankers who were in trial for their responsibility in fraud with the former chief of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges because of falling with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to court in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a celebrated case in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case marks the final fleet of a research launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, bank charges against bankers were alerted in 2002 to Fastow, which was the objective of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - it doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the artifact of a thousand frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into failure.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that it would value in height.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received around 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron’s collapse.
Three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is executing a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers had to pay $1 million for living in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business seem successful.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive chief, Jeffrey Schilling, were in charge of the crowns last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Schilling is executing a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"He has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Golfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonario Fair, a four-day-consuming organ held in a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Golfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from yachts crafted in caoba to the pair of diamond-plated cars, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looks at a bright orange Porsche in the nearby stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by oil rise, the Russian capital looked like Dallas when he was in custody.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some educated Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, Senior Professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another location in Moscow, this week a conference will be held on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the company New York Times)
Russia has 53 multimillionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich includes 103,000 Russian million, whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thanks.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, about 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London Joyer.
She attended the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impeccably prepared and the men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon clothes, two agents of roots, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"Looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reled off the design suit that used as a network of vete mapping with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum shorts, Mövenpick ice creams, charge pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears.
The general public can buy 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand-patriated blues.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10-15 years for the Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the vocabulative logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the holiday last Thursday, Roman Ersov, Director General of King Koil's Beds, said he sold two seven thousand dollar spoon systems each, made of silk, cascade, and cotton, intertwined with gold yarns.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, salesman for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-range cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $17,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, was a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car pairs in chain bracelet form for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a wheel wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants avestrosis leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive over those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian Millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price fluctuation of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least in paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with false billboards of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
The visitors stopped shaking money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on monsoons, or getting a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "chapuz" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant's window "A bit healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two doors below in West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then I went up to the ambulance," said Mr. Livingstone, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"It was there when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities assumed that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, a 41-year-old assistant to the Newark Police Department.
The researchers are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for up to a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that lies ahead of the top lines of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar with many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, and who left two children 14 and 11 years of age, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On 21 November, they found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
She was declared dead in the place.
It has been more than a week and the authorities have said little about their research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a marched rose is located in the front of the house, and a long stone on the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for the vanilla in food and perfumes - was found at the door of the car, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes are stuck with hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch this one," he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
He's pregnant."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the rates to lift the Stock Exchange
The actions jumped both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm the credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the Vice-President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The scholarships took place in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the number two of Ben Bernanke, the president of the reserve, declared that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets through growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent cuts of the type of interest, to stabilize credit conditions.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as the sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turmoil were highlighted by a Bear Stearns notice, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total labour force, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average went up to 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close of 13.289.40, while the S&P 500's broad index went up to 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index raised 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain's first-order companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand for a three-month loan from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the value markets in London stressed the credit and the three-month "Libor" loan rates among the British banks, meant the largest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with judgment
Here are two dilemmas, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan--with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and moreover, because Hugh Morris' desk, director of England, is beginning to fill out offers to become a national electorate, and if not, in a part of time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth place to fight will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck more than because of capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because judgements are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way, if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two young executive brilliants with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the table: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a drummer to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison was declared "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class tickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium can be only one question of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite noting a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, it could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's session at the Asgiria Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable proof of the beginning of the 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indians in the trial in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" some of his fans than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live in swords.
He caught up with nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he threw his vehicle at an exhibition for the English car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, most likely, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (companioned, of course) and call Alasair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to say with excitement, "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including your relaxing pass to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, because it fights with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were without cash, no visa extensions, and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some even had returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary ceasefire.
Qasim at Atwani, a 38-year-old Chiita and professor in the sunny area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an American allied force helped Al-Qaeda out of his fortress west of the capital, and urged him to come back.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad for a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the US troops joined groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with US soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But many have claimed to have returned for the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chinese minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian paintings of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunite said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the sunites have been expelled from the Shiite and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring up the sectarian tensions again and start the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"I explained yesterday for the 15th time to a non-Sarlander who is not French" -- that was the ironic motorcycle on itself from the smallest federal state for his 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system, which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Buildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, higher education by tradition has good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
So far, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a pool.
"The system of vocational education is used in Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, the expert in the education sector at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of dual careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of students in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students late in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the sarcasm, although in this field good results could be achieved.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory assignment in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez lets the time in the South American country change by delaying the half-hour clock.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin, under the new law, the time will be less than four hours of GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world in its day by changing a full time.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the break-up of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
The nationalist on the left said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, their power in the country could be extended considerably.
The reason for the conflict was the decision by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which the liberation of hostages was concerned.
Sunday Chavez criticizing the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decrease in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjunction.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a real salary lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices," reported the newspaper "Build" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research.
New burdens of unemployment insurance can also be borne by employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent when spending one year on another is just and reasonable.
Of course, the working office does not have to go back to an unpleasant situation, requesting credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivative sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Yellow Brother of the Earth.
In spite of its atmosphere it is not suitable for life, Venus is the most earth-like planet, something that has not yet been raised. The European Venus Express probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolons in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers have suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call from a height of 54 kilometers of one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean which, for their part, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if there was ever a life there, it would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface reigns temperatures of 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possible, Venus is a "diabolic twin" from Earth, but still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question why Venus, so much like Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As there have been no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to researchers' opinion, stress not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had imagined," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vertice formed by the clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon reminds the wind currents in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piconi of the Italian Institute for Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost that large.
This planet is also called a white star or a evening star orbited around the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists depart from the basis that both planets had been formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets, water had become abundant that remained on the Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissolved in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus formed most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's half with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after half in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore demanded that the great coalition end this fight at the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt ".
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of a Chinese policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his hatred for the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor led to great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese Government, demanded the Chancellor of the Federal Angel Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Assuming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in his official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that she was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disorders such as those in France will occur.
Battalions with the police on the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances as was France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany is not moved to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot with guns at the police: after serious youth-related disturbances in France, the Federal Minister of Interior, Wolfgang Schaeube (Party of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to set the tabblín in which the social problems of our country do not take the violent form."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said New Press, published in Hanover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit on Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It's still early to give the end of the alarm a seat.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The young people played a major role in the streets with the police in northern Paris last night.
In Tolouse cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action is necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of less than 25 years of age is above the average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", higher than the French country.
Moreover, most of the young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat believes: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
There is a need to "give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training as quickly as possible".
While the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a light helicopter overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until it is necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disorder began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not the result of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The very far-off performance of the Federal Chancellor's reality shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that there is nothing more to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent, and lacking content in the general debate of the Lower Chamber, she must say: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
With regard to the repudiation made to him by having repeatedly devoted himself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with an alleged sentence.
He said that it would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what was in the interest of critics.
In the Lower Chamber, it was made very clear to all that that reproach was appropriate.
It was not possible to feel a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented itself in this way: a very high policy that runs into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very much praised for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these goals should be achieved here in climate issues.
In general, this way of commending ourselves - for two years the leader of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
So it's stuck in expressions to give people a boost.
And so it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems appear of little value.
Is the poverty of children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to talk when it comes to supplementing children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a better sentence.
It began to troupe "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a heated debate on the Republican Presidential Presidy of YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have been observed since the beginning.
Mitt Romney rebuked his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned to New York as "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
He, for his part, replied with serious insults: "I mean that his own home was a "door" for the illegals." Giuliani answers the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who used illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to be attacked: as the group of Republicans so far has no clear preference, the eight presidential precedents take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit its opponents.
The small 30-second videos, surrounded by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, have not much content either.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler reach power," was John McCain's insult to his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown in his death simulates his death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg room in Florida show that while the most important issues in the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied tax collection.
That way you can see better where the weaknesses of both of you are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney compulsively and asks for forgiveness for people and the television audience because he was the advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when he was asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf government without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn to be president.
That's how the eight years of military rule ended in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
The Wednesday transferred its military commander's mandate to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after power was done with an incredulous military coup, the former general for the first time ruled the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the state general prosecutor, after the Muharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of exception and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since the announcement of an exception in the Supreme Court, there have been many party lawyers in Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new elections of the head of the government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waterist region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman's information, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock come back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restorer, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the best time in the band.
They were already very famous in foreign countries at that time.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has its box, its cables and especially its buttons in front of it.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's passionates was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What we have to rebel here is this: the questions have shown that the name of the band resounded in the minds of people, but it was not as special as that after 32 years the public was so surprised.
But why can't Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Mostly because the Krautrock mistake was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the Can 2003 Colonia band for their work of life, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with surprise.
Later, Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (from the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this side, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, but it was subsequently achieved thanks to the others.
A long time ago Moebius and Roedelius had performed music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised very famous.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Dusseldorf who was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruins, they lived as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, there was an association banner of the harmony of Ottenstein in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone recalls that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to move Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on issues of esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster's lived in the '80s and since then has had more success than he had in Harmony.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that has to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland was set to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band New! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures at the Wordtronics Festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers in a finca.
The history of the development of legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where cable instruments are seen.
In the bottom are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices that they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is just like it was supposed to be.
Three people deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment he coughs, whispers, and at a good time of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
But it was never rock.
Gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here cries "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
The stage is very well reflected on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can break one's nerves or give you some quick luck moments.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but right there, in the darkness of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the '80s, because no one wanted to see it after their pleasant roles and of little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movies' titles have to be so long and shot today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the bottom, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decade had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerdescher Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, is only a series of unsuccessful films on the war in the Balkans.
The film "Maedersicher Frieden" can be described in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb of Kosovo's Frenchmen, one of them acting very quickly, and it also leads to her being loved by her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm Fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was really never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story of American reporters in the war going to detect a criminal war Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and always results in a crazy journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they present us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let him be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also provides a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian that will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all world head hunters could not achieve for five years, who were captured by the war criminal and left the Muslim Bosnians to avenge themselves in a just way.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and it highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head with a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great rusts of his front I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they demonstrate that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only the type of war movies in the Balkans.
Not long ago in a newspaper, he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fictitious.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It's almost always a rule: when a star merges into a region of crisis or in the mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Probably all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to go for at least decades until Hollywood is driving a good film on the burnt offering, for example, the film "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the works on war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because the script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"Whether or not" or "The Great dictator" proved so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that it was really so bad the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to round a movie.
Perhaps it must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked about the parallelisms between his novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "It is only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy because he did not apply for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that it must be realistic to estimate the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the great city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games would not be carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but decides on it by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we so far thought to have up to 2028, we will have no opportunity from a realistic point of view."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years, Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are now ruined," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of HSB.
A resignation of the application is contrary to the statement by the chief of the Senate at a reception on the basis of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of Higher Schools (Adh).
There von Beust appointed the application of Hamburg for the 2015 Universities not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sports of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate of not taking the time to build homes in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was on plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed the cause of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever ties the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box of the "type" of this list are false.
After a few months the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes in 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "type Stockholm", which are in circulation in the international art market, are also found.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powders.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum, hundreds of carton-boxes were exposed. These were not made by Warhol (due to the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
It was not art works, but copies (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol made it possible to produce in Sweden some wood-boxes, but they were not exposed in the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and sub-assemblies as the originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased in substations for over $100,000.
The problem is that then the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö to Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and embellished their printed plates and then painted them in the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a round without directly printing the printed plates. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum museum will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exhibition".
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it would accept these "serious accusations" as regards soap powder boxes.
But since then, everything has remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had been harassed in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The head of Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter who could not respond to the bloodshed.
The faithful soldiers to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been accommodating in the building for hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had the trial Thursday for trying a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could be able to deposit himself with about 30 sympathetics.
The military policemen who had to monitor him had evidently passed on to their ranks and followed their motive.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Council, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are tired," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to move on to our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the Scout Reangers elite, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The major government critics called Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months, his government has been retaliating for corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the motive it was trying against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines, at least seven attempts have been made to defeat the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company informed that the average price for an action was EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscribe Line).
On Wednesdays they already made assumptions about the entry into business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation in the Dusseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the shares for a third party.
United Internet has already participated with almost 10 percent of the Drillisch telecommunications company on the previous day.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares with a value of EUR 106.4 million in capital expansion.
The United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL products.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration," the spokesperson for United Internet explained.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
The Thursday United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent participation in Freenet and do not use their right, i.e., to participate in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
They had then agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
