I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like dancing.
It's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow this.
Good morning.
Do you like the joke?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about it.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're laughing a lot.
Tell me what you'll get in the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you give me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should talk about it.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church with the car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm proud.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Let them know I'm innocent.
The humid fish isn't my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They're lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
It's okay?
What's your new book title?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you work?
Can anyone explain that to me?
Who is she?
We need to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We planted the house green.
Time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Milly doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Let him know I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
The score is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he should.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sorry.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What's light isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
He hits my phone.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his bag in the middle of the train.
They killed our throats.
My name is not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a village with swords.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes running.
Tom didn't want to touch you.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing exactly the scissors.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today give more importance to people's culture than to the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you wash your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How did you get through the vacations?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here!
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
You're called?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house is completely destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary took pictures of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
He's either coming or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a matter of money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not gonna be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Tomma's phone hit, but he didn't know it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was extraordinary.
About.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
It's off 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain's got us pretty good.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw it with romantic virtues.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Larry's still at school.
My office is in the city center.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canada.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom dismissed Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom wears gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's been screaming.
He didn't go to the lake.
He's speaking in French.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the evidence?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your earphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm indifferent.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news got him.
We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We don't have anywhere to go.
How many squares can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
They're big?
Tom's from Boston.
Every day, Tom drinks.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see any TV.
I'm the coach.
Tom's gonna work this afternoon.
Who is she?
Get some sleep.
He missed the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the graphs.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom put a rose on the wall.
We're very busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company cancelled the project.
"Fire!" he cried.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm happy to be able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm a lawyer for Harvard.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did it because I was asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was decoupling the visibility.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now it's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your clothes?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't received an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your credit card?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkos.
Can you get rid of ten or six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When do you leave for vacations?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's an emergency.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There was no salt.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke up in tears.
He's talking like a truck.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he doesn't tell the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It'll be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made dinner for me.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
The seventh is considered a lucky number.
Where are your clothes?
I can't say for sure what's going to happen.

I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
I haven't been working since I got married.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a carriage?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't think things?
Don't apologize.
That walk is slow.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time does it start?
I'm up now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like playing piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.

Who cares?
Tell me what you want.

Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.

The kids look scared.
Tom pulled out his hat.
I want to see the streets.
Which one is mine?

There's no tea left.
All the visitors have left.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't take part in the debate.
Note: In English we publish nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build stores?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Kryllos; I'm glad to meet you!
He's got good legs.
His current behavior confirms what we suspected.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami went to bed and had a bathroom in Leilas.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.

We laughed.
Take me with you.
I have to go to sleep.
They're even more alive.
They'll fix him.

Help me get her up.

You made the same mistake again.
Kate doesn't celebrate her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to pay?
Aren't you happy?
I'm sorry, Tom.

That's exactly what you need now.
I've been doing some research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still raining, right?
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold. Why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see it?
The birds are red.
Find me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We circled for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not a farmer.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, give it up, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?

Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Sammy says it's your safety.

Resolutions do not have to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything can be a space of resolution enough to have defined the addition between divisions and multiplication with a degree size.
His money's in the bank.
I'm very proud.
I love my country.
We went to a serious debate.
They're here.
I guess someone likes Tom.
Will you visit me?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the party.
As he hit the phone, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore her best dress.
Tom's invincible.
Tom can speak both French and English.
Tom predicted that Mary would do it.
I can't leave.
I'm a genosticist.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you all right?
This book belongs to Paul.
It doesn't seem to be Canadian Tom.

Take it.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose into the window.
You're smaller than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.

You may be right.
The oxygen is necessary for the combustion.
Are you all right?
You're unbelievable.
Let her know I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?

His present attitude confirms what we imagined.
Tom told me he'd like to repair Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
More powerful.

Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You told me.
This is my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm proud.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
I'm on a regular basis.
And talking about genocide, it's Columbus Day.
Sama took another camera.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance to the bathroom is very bad.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our target.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget tonight.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary answered the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I drink at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't find this word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
He answered the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost my last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that I could barely move.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom's got a blue eye.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have wine.
We got there first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everybody started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're big enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only thing I think is that it's probably common in all philosophical theories.
Why don't I stay surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very excited now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of fuss around here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
The language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Will Tom die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
A lot of questions remain.
I like Irish music.
Give me a bottle.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have some tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has very long hair.
I'm lonely.
I know how they call her.
Thank you so much for coming, guys!

I'm sorry I met her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm out.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
Excuse me?
Where did you find the key?
Could that not be correct?
Tom can't stand the warm and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, pick up the phone at night.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's Italian, isn't it?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
There were many pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful that you don't need a match.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as he could.
I like fishing.
I don't like those sweets.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate a orange.
You're the expert.
Let him know I'm ready.
I have a meeting with the doctor.
Yes.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I get it.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of maniacs.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I've been asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've been through it.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's a covert with strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy you.
Tom knocked on the door.
I'm staying here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to me later.
Put the book on the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canadian.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Do you send a message to them?
Can I borrow a mole?
We only have three choices.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom's rocking.
Don't turn the light off.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unhappy.
Aren't you a teacher?
Let him know we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom's gone.
Thank you. You're fantastic.
Will Israel attack Iran?
I like to laugh.
I washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating later will help you feel more dormant.
I'm French.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
I got up early last night.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not difficult for the French.
Someone's calling.
We found her.
Where are you going?
His hair was brown.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do I speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
Here and how long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before dinner.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a lecture.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father is missing.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's not back in Okinawa.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why'd you kiss her?
I hope the bus route is not boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom beat Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.
I'm talking to Esperando.
California is boring.
I'm happy!
All of them are Canadians.
You're not welcome.
She's a pretty girl.
He's helping him.
Nothing's missing.
She started singing.
This is a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
He wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a hard day.

Good day, isn't it?
I thought you were Japanese.
The price of this car has a discount of fifteen percent.
How are you?
Tom went to bed too late.
That's the absolute truth.

Your turn.
I didn't believe him until he came and talked to me in detail.

What's he going to order in the restaurant?
You have to listen to me.
Stop fighting!

We'll find it.
I'm weird.
Here I eat.
This is a Japanese doll.
He pulled out his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one of them is mine?
Tom doesn't speak French.
I've been to ten foreign countries so far.
You underestimated me.
Finally, these two are still under repair.
I'm glad.
I wasn't angry.
That's not my key.
You're doctors.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.

I'm still looking for Tom.
What did they say?
Do you need them?

First of all, he doesn't like to be called a big horse.
Tom wanted answers.
They just left.
Tom is the boss of Mary.
Why are you so strict with yourself?
Tom's eating cat food.
The computer is innovative.
That book is written in French.
Tom's running fast.
Tom put his hands back in his pockets.
Tell him you lied.

They wanted to steal the car.
You like my new shirt?
You'll be jealous.
What's the title of your new book?
We know each other pretty well.

I want to die.
Did you eat anything?
I guess you're better than Tom.
The city I grew up is very beautiful.
Tom's writing too fast.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
He'll understand.
They forgave you.
My father is the whole world.
Tom will be ready.
You guys seem busy.
Are they talking about Tom?
I love Hotomi.
Do you want to be famous?
I forgot to buy flowers in Mary.
I'm not a professional.
Who owns this car?
Tell them to leave.
He worked hard.
Let him help us.
Tom likes adventures.
Were you there?
It's working.
I don't like surprises.
Jane was angry.
We'll wait.
I think Tom has three choices.
We'll be together.
Tom agreed to give us an interview.
To our health!
We'll save you.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Why did you stop?
I assumed you were Canadian.
That's yours, isn't it?
Tom eats bread once a week.
I went in.
Let's get him a drink.
I think he's innocent.
Who's your teacher?

It's true.
I can't eat.
You've been 30 minutes late.

They're not alive.
Where did Tom suffer?
Tom said he'd probably go shopping with Mary on Monday.
I thought you could help me.
I should have been with them.
You work hard.
I love pancakes.
When I'm done with what I do, I'll come.
How many days were you in Boston?
They got there before dawn.

The farmer was the killer.
I heard Tom's in Australia.

I want us all to stay under the same roof.
We all want to do it this afternoon.
I miss Boston.
We have three kids.
You're not Japanese.
Tell him I'm ready.
Linda likes to eat chocolate.
He's trying.

Don't leave me here alone.
Tom and Su have been known since 1985.
Do you speak Chinese?
I have two mother tongues.
I'm not gonna text you.
What happened?
We heard you went through the exams.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What the hell was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.

I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went to the church every Sunday.
Tell her we'll be ready.
Can I accompany you to the front door?

I want to know what's in the box.
She's younger than your sister.
When do your holidays start?
Tom's done it.
What did you say?
I've already talked to Tom about it.
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you're using is slow.
I left the door open.
Let him not come.
He ate all the apple.
I'm not kidding.
I'm kidding.
It's different.
I just moved.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than that.
I want this TV.
She's tired.
In an hour, we'll be done.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom's turning the table, right?
Tell them your theory.
I could find my phone if I did that.

I'm your teacher.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?

I write a letter to Maria.
Tom and Mary love each other.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?
The chairs will be here tomorrow.

As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
She's smart, isn't she?
Tom's always willing to help.
Thank you so much for coming, kids!
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?

He was born rich.
That's a sign.
Tom made a deal with the government.
I'm playing violin.
Pick up your stuff and go.
You'll be amazed at what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We have to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom had to go to school when he was a kid.
They robbed me.
Only we can get rid of them.
I guess someone should like Tom.
He's always working a lot.
You destroyed him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people, but I've never tried to be someone other than myself.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most widely distributed book in the world?
At dawn, the iron is stuck.
Is this book yours?
You're much smarter than I am.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the target.
My grandson is crying so hard.
Can you take over here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.

When are you leaving?
What time does the store open?
I don't know French.

From your mouth and to God's ears!
You shot her.
They like you.

Where are you working?
They're actors.
Can you speak my language?
You're not going to Australia to build stores?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course, every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Drive straight until you see the post office and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom lives a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He's gonna jump.
You're ready.
We recognized you.
It's a diet.
You're sick, you need to rest.
Tom is obedient.
I underestimated him.
Are you Canadians really?
All of a sudden, I started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Ala's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I have ten styles.
I appreciate that.
You paid all the bills?
Did you buy flowers?
Tom's getting close.
You told her.
Don't kick the dog's tail.
Tom's mad at us.
I bought you red roses.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone call.
You look tired.
Not a lot of people like Tom.

I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like him or not.
To forgive others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.

Guess what he told me.
The door's locked.
This song is for you.

Tom contacted Mary.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom was wearing a white shirt.
Tom would have defended me.
You were perfect.
How much do you want?

Tom gave good advice to Mary.
He's buying the computer.
Can you make a vertical?
I like that shirt.

I'm proud.
They had three sons.
I didn't want milk.
I'm not going to disappear.
Do they understand?
It's Sunday today.
What are you gonna leave behind?
There's no fever.
Tom doesn't come here often.

I haven't tried.
There's a man at the door.
Where's Tom?

I can't do anything for you.
You're drunk!

We're all Canadians here.
This is a comprehensive approach.
I don't like this town at all.
Tom has a son and a daughter.
He may have changed.
I married a Canadian.
Let her know you don't need it.

The dog eats a apple.
Tom tried to satisfy his wife.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
A good dress ensures a meeting, but a good mind an essential relationship
Who washed the car?
This probably affected their decision.
Tom is better in French than in English.
I remember.
Are you working on Monday?
I don't know how Tom's coming out.
No one's sitting here.
Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant leap for humanity.
You must hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like a orange juice.
I'm ironing my clothes.
That's not true.
We need action, not words.
Everyone went to the same bar.
Who's Tom talking about?
Tom told Mary he was always living in Boston.
There's a lot of heretics in Iceland.
We'll stay more if we've had more time.
Let's order two bottles.
I'm weak.

Don't leave me like that.
Tom has come back from Australia.
Excuse me, what time is it?
I'm not surprised.
I'll give you Tom's address.
When did you come back from Tokyo?

Tell him I'm not gonna do that.
The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth... the last.

I'll remember that.
Your French are improving.
I'm not wasting my time.
Get him why you can't go.
Come with me to the south coast of France!

I lent my father's neck to build a doghouse.
I'm just done.
He's not Algerian.
When Tom gets here, I'll pay the money I promised.
First the migrants, then you, our solidarity response to social cannibalism.
Can you take this line?
Can you freeze the cheese?
I don't like taking risks.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Tom's taller than I am.
Do what you think.
Stop there.
I'll talk.
Are you sure?
Her eyes were red from the cry.
You're taller than Tom?
I went to the park with Mary yesterday.
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
He's awake.
I could do it in the morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He doesn't even know how to write or read.
I'm sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.
Tell them to help me.
Tom was dressed like a girl.
How much does the pants do?
I like my coffee to be warm.
Tell them we're busy.
I like the way you think.
Tom refused to listen.
When will he come home?
Tom's good at cooking.
It's disgusting.
Do you have tattoos?
That's what's obvious.
"May I help you?" "No, thank you, I'm just kidding."
Mary protected her husband.
You're not Japanese.
Son of a bitch!
Tom was still calm.
They say you can usually judge people from the company they have.
We don't have anything.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to meet tomorrow.
We like music.
Can you slow down a little bit?

They've got the news.
I visited her in Germany.

I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
Were you watching?
I can read without glasses.
Tell me your address.
We have what we deserve.
Let's talk about it.
You don't trust me, do you?
My job is to teach English.
That brings me great joy.
Tell them I'm not gonna do that.
I like Boston so much.
I'd like to help you.
I'm a lord.
You'll be safe with Tom.
He tried to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, speak English?
You were late yesterday.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm a man.
Everybody likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of important things.
There are five fish in my tank.

Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love the farm.
Who were you talking to?
You need to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your shame?
Apparently Tom's a lot of trouble.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can catch me?
Tom planted three apples in his yard.
Tom claimed he was innocent.
Smile.
Your face is red.

Tom has a high moral standard.
I'm in danger.
Tom wore gloves.
Tom forgave Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You don't have to say such things when there are kids around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadians.
We recognized it.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His husband doesn't even know why he died.
You need to see this movie.
Drive safely.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I lost my lunch card.
There was no time.
After the accident, the wounded were transferred to the hospital.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I played tennis.
And with others, I don't like wearing pants.
We're planning on going to your party.
Thank you for coming!
Tom sang.
He's a dancer.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
She's very piantic to me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's handling the French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's keep going.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes flowers.
I think they're liars.
This elevator can carry ten people in a moment.
Freedom is not free.
He's teaching us French.

Tom has a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.

Tom loved Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.
How many letters do you send to Tom?
I've been seeing him for months.
I forgot her accent.
I want you back in Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I'm drinking milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favorites.
One speaks English and the other Japanese.
When do you plan to get married?
They write.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it could mean to be there.
It was English.
I had no doubt.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The streets are covered by snow.
Well, I have a proposal to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna say?
He cut the smoke.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
There's only water.
I can't forget her beauty.
Do you wash your hands before you eat?

Everybody's got secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have a brake.
I like helping others.
What animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
You know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You've hidden the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I understand.
You're still alive.
How old are they?
Let her not come.
Is Tom really Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
The passion is learned.
How can we do that?
Do you think you could help me clear the garden this afternoon?
I can't eat pig.
You're very generous.
It's on the eighth floor.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm for swimming.
I want revenge.
I'm tired.
Dinner's mine today.
We're willing to negotiate.
The girl wants to learn the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work on Sunday?
I feel guilty.
I'm out of sleep.
Follow him.
I prefer coffee.
There's a cure.
It's unlikely he's coming today.
My father hasn't had dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
He's become rich.
My girlfriend is Canadian.
If I wasn't weak, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
“ Do you speak English? ” — “Not yet, this is my first lesson! ”
We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat the girls?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you gonna tell them?
She's very glaring.
Who brought you here?
We had our vacations on the lake.
Who locked the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
Take my wife.
Put your clothes on here.
Is Mary your daughter?
I'm not inflamed.
I want the book.
You have to help him.
He's drinking beer.
Today it's Thomas' birthday.
My wife's a doctor.
Someone gave you something.
I'm watching TV.
Tom bought a full-time car.
Tom has a lot of money.
You don't have any way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't bother me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but they promised him promotion very soon.
She likes oranges?
Are you angry with me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the plates.
I like snow.
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I don't care about modern art.
We killed them.
You're so beautiful!
Tom is famous.
Tom says he needs help.
Why did you shoot them?
He took a lot more than I expected.
Who was right?
I want to watch TV.
I took him down.
Speak French.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still shocked.
He'll find it tonight.
I'm the coach.
Who's going to drive?

Mary's wife is rich.
The roses smell good.
Welcome to our country!
What's your favorite color?
Tell us about it.
Don't make a noise!
I'm squeezing once a week.
Tom's smarter.
Tom started it.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I still love Tom.
This is an incredible result.
I like it, and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
I love you, Tom.
Tom has gray hair.
We shot him.
You got three cars, right?
Tom will find us.
It's up to you.
I don't remember inviting you.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
What do you got there?
Tom's gonna change.
Where's the envelope?

You're very attractive.
Is it the Venezuelan law in Australia?
I don't give.
He loves his son.
I'm very disappointed.
He'll protect you.
Was the soup delicious?
Where did you put that?
Doctors have a difficult problem.
There are three stores in the mall.
Keep digging.
I like helping others.
I need water.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
Yankev was greatly influenced by the story of Borekh.
I'm not against them.
He must be an American.
When should we give the report?
Who stole Tom's bike?
We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you referring to?
Someone's singing.
How many Spring Rolls did you eat?
The flower is blue.
I like this room.
If you really want to know, all you need is to ask.
Who's this girl?
You don't know them.
He's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop is not open.
You underestimated it.
Throw her out.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
Those candles aren't white.
The man they're talking about has died a long time ago.
Tom and Mary didn't agree to anything.
I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're gonna build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English!
That's fantastic!
Tell the Hungarians!
I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting will start.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
You like white chocolate?
The snakes are bats.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I'd like to visit the ancient Athens.
This rope is very strong.
You're gonna be busy.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
You're alive.
Look around.
Tom said he knew Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
Did he admit it?
I paid someone to clean my house.
I'll cook something for you.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.
Tom really wants to help.
They didn't understand the question.
I hear music.
I'll call you in an hour.
I'm done writing.
I'm in Boston.
I got a valuable lesson.
Where can I find an ATM?
Let's thank him.

Why are you so disappointed?
Go to Tom to help Mary.
Get Tom on the phone at 2:30.
The dog slept on the roof.
They need you.
How old are your brothers?
Tom bought a car in Mary.
It's almost summer.
I guessed right.
Tom studied in Boston.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.
From now on, you'll have to read more.
I've never had such a problem.
Have we lost?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I don't blame anyone.
I miss Tom.
I have to go to sleep.
Tom hasn't called yet.
Tom wanted revenge.
I need money.
Were you in the army?
You're a good journalist.
You have a good plan.
I'm not going to buy anything today.
How old were you when you left Australia?
Tom killed himself in Boston.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.

Let me do my job.

I'm not asking for money.
Don't tell me you're sorry about me.
What direction did he go to?
Tom can't walk.
I'm proud of my brother.
I don't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll find out.
I want to see them again.
He was murdered.
You're bigger than me.
We're doctors.
Do you think you could help me get the weeds out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadians, aren't you?
I have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at 5:00.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom burned three candles.
We're gonna be killed.
Do you send him a message?
I'll show you the city.
I want to close the door.
Why would you do that?
He's lost in the woods.
How far is it from Bruno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's a pocket, isn't he?
What are you gonna eat today?
Tom's a Canadian.
You're in love?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of thought.
Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, generous and, provably, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.
Tom sings pretty well.
I was tired.
You were perfect.
Tell him how important it is.
Why exactly did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay still.
I admire you.
Tom came to Japan from Australia.
This is my best friend.
Let's talk about it.
Your father won't buy it.
He may have his faults, but I'm taking him.

"There'll be live music in the picnic." "What kind of music?"
He made tea.

Tom was happy.
Your husband teaches me Italian.

We're trying.
Is that Spanish?
You know, the dead of the night I've got this staff, so it's gonna be a little bit of a partian semantic.
I left the bank with my bare hands.
Why don't you tell them?
Is she asleep?
Where's the school?
I'm not interested in politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm very tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand?
Tom has never used the Internet.
When did you start using contact lamps?
If I wasn't weak, I'd buy it.
Sometimes he comes home late.

Wait a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in the city.
I had a difficult year.
What do they want?
Anna can't find a job.
This man is not my husband.
Tell them we're busy.

Here's my album.
What fruit is red?

Bring the Duma.

Where did you find the keys?
Some people do bad things.
You don't hear.
Nobody trusts you.
Give me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll meet you at the hospital.
He's been looking for it in Wikipedia.

We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's gonna cook.
I'm scared.

I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's gonna listen.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.

I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you've gone to the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.

Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?

Meat?

I'll buy one.
I understand.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They're all out running.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's empty.
Tell them how important it is.
The party is Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to her screaming.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my style.
How does that word apply?
He saved me.
I had an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't be drunk.
I look forward to your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.

Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than that.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How many years are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."
Get some water.

He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good appearance.
What are you gonna say to Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your command the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car's brummy.
I have to tell you the truth.

Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We're getting ready.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me to sleep, right?
Does it work?
It's much smoother.
They'll hear us.

Anything else?
Tom's a lover.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You're looking forward to it today.
I want you to stay.
We'll get her.
That's easy to say, hard to do.

Is there anything different?
We're not always right.

There was no salt.

Do you agree, Tom?
Wait here.
Should I ask you a personal question?
They trusted her.
If we want to.
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.

I have to tell them.
Why are you angry?
Don't give up tomorrow what you can do today.
He needs money.
You're not a doctor.
Who shot Tom?
We can get there with the meter.
We know each other very well.
No one likes war.
They pay well.
We're playing baseball.
You're not gonna find him.
There's no one left there.
Call me tonight.
You're not a lawyer.
He wasn't your brother.
Go ahead and make room for the others.
I touched them.
Buy some games.
Let them know I'm ready.
His real name is Tom.
Blue is my favorite color.
Have you ever seen a wolf?

What did you tell her?
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
Thank you.
I'm not hiding.
Your house is burning!
I was disappointed.
It's not a cat, it's a dog.
Isn't it cold?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
Tom's listening.
Tom didn't help the poor.
It's said there's no life in Ares.
I'm thirty.
I woke up earlier than usual.

I agree with you 100%.
We were all tired.
Open the bottle.
What exactly did you say?
I want to be an astronaut.
How are you your mother?
Is there any field of tennis around here?
Break the chocolate into smaller pieces.
Tom's not gonna talk.
You're not welcome here.
You're not gonna find them.
I'm glad I came.
I like talking in French.
He's taller than his father.
You should write a letter.
Is it clear?
You killed her.
His current behavior confirms what we suspected.
I have several Canadian friends.
None of the students found the right answer.
In the pool!
You're sick!

There was nothing in the room except an old chair.
Tom brought some flowers to Mary.
Who sent this?
I'd like two pounds of cream.
Do you really think Tom would come out with me?
It's wrong.
You're a disgrace.
Excuse me, where's the beach?
The party is tomorrow.
Will you tell them?
Tom will find us.
We played tennis yesterday.
Let him know I'm ready.
Your clothes are all dirty.
What did we lose?
I wonder why he's so angry.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
What was I thinking?
I'm not busy today.
You like rap?
Let me introduce you.
Dishona!
We need more volunteers.
Your car's ready.
Who shot you?
You're ready.
Does Tom know how Mary feels about John?

You're a good man.
Does he have a piano?
Everything's fine.
Sure.
You're Canadian, right?

If anyone can do this, it's you.
Tom confessed.
I'm inconvenient.
I'm speaking Lithuanian.
His sister and her husband are staying in Canada.
These lemons are fresh.

Why don't you say something?
Because I've done this to Tom again, I know he won't be able to do it so well.
Give me three months.

There must be a better way.
I'm cooking now.
I want the truth.

They forgave you.
You want one of them?
We'll try it.
I did my job.
I'm an archaeologist.
I trusted him.
You've got to get rid of this bad habit.
Don't talk about my friend like that.

Can you tell me why you want to work for us?
Tom will miss you.
Please remember to send this letter.
Would you like to learn French?
It's a good rule to look both ways before you cross the street anywhere.

Wait, I want to tell you something.
The teacher is friendly.
I thought he was sick.
Have you read French yesterday?
Tom went through amazingly in Boston.
I've changed.

She's not happy.
There were a few kids in the room.
Tell him the truth.
Why do they do that?
When did you go there?
I can't forget you.
I'm not going to Australia.
I thought you were Canadian.

Could you tell us something about yourself?
He's not a diabetic, Tom.
Have you seen Grand Canyon?
He loves him, his grandfather.
Tom told me he'd like to repair Boston.
I'm sorry to bother you, but someone's calling you on the phone.
She was very unfair.
A proposal is never innocent.
In my opinion, you are beautiful.
I like that language.
Her real name is Lisa.
Who would you like?
Is this radio yours?
There were friends left.
I refuse to allow it.
Who killed Tom?

Are you working?
I broke Tom.
Are you busy?
I told you about you.
I'll count to three.
The air is invisible.
Tom wanted to be a farmer.
I can't find time to read books.
Tell them why.
What color is your car?
No one's going out that time.
Tell her I'm innocent.
I'm unemployed.
Looks like he's gonna win the first prize.
What are you gonna drink?
I have nightmares.
It's raining the car.
If I wasn't weak, I'd buy it.

Let's learn French.
The pool in this restaurant is really good!

Is that Tom's notes?
Tom's starting to hit a target.
I'd like a ticket to Boston.
Open your books.
You're the only Canadian in our school.
The author expresses his opinion by supporting it in academic research.
They're here.

They're not happy.
I'll kill you.
I'm not gonna lose it.
They're red.
Why did you leave the door open?
I felt like an engine with so many people looking at me.
I'd like your help.

No one's staying there.
You'll be fine without me.
They multiply like rabbits.
He always smokes.
You need to learn to be more careful.

Tom lives in Boston?
You're very rich.
Where does Tom work?
Tom's gonna kill you.
Have you fed the horse?
Amilia's a teenager.
Tom asked me to stay.
Give me a proof, please.
Are you working on Monday?
Tom started drinking.
I'll swim.
I'm sending him a message.
Take them with you.
You told him.
We won't win.
You forgot your arms.
I'm from Malta.
Tom's from Harvard.
What would you do if you were in my position?
Who told them?
We've been studying all afternoon.
He died at 54 years of age.
I'm from Turkey.
Tell them to come home.
Why is that baby crying?
How sweet?
I don't have to cook it.
I remember them.
I'll order food.

We didn't help them get away with it.
I know a lot of Canadians.
Let them know we're busy.
I'll never forget that night.
I'm a lord.
I like to solve secrets.
It's Saturday today.
Tom, come here quickly!

Where's my book?
I like flowers.
Do you have green tea?
I've seen it.
Everybody can play.
What color is your truck?
Are we weak?
Who did Tom save?
The doctor advised me not to work so much here and there.
Warn Tom.
I'm afraid of cats.
Tell me what to do.
What exactly are you going to do with this?
Tom drinks a lot of beer.
Are you drunk?
In college we competed with each other.
Tom hugged Mary and kissed her.
He's been a teacher.
They'll fix it.
I think it was unfair.
We need to work together.
I'm very proud.
I'm going to tell Aimilia.
Stop right now.
We are facing a difficult situation.
We grew up together.
Where were you in 2003?
They obeyed.
The property is stolen.
I guess you're Canadian.
We're having a meal.
This one's a jacket.
I'm talking about you.
I have something to tell you.
Please don't interrupt me.
Why are you lying to me?
It's Serbia's third largest city.
He doesn't have a lot of books, Tom.
We all speak French.
It's spending a lot of money.
Don't open this box.
Did Tom commit suicide?
Who blew it?
The exceptions confirm the rule.
Call the doctor!
He was playing piano.
These are ours.
The Greeks often eat fish.
You want to tell her?
See ya!
Ask Tom to help you.

Did you know that Tom and Mary both have houses in Park Street?
I'm very tired.
The dog is white.
Tom knows us well.
I bet Tom knows the answer.
You run every day?
I think someone's calling you.
And Tom and I are Canadians.
I'm usually pretty patient.
Is Tom home?
I like these two.
I was born in Israel.
Someone poisoned them.
It's totally my fault.
These gloves don't hurt me.
You're young.
They're selling flowers in this store?
He's brave enough to go there alone.
We'll get it.
Don't worry.
Their father had a big shoe shop in town.
Tom's trying.
He made me a cake.
How many have you killed?
I made two.
We haven't seen Tom in weeks.
We're the champions.
It was from Australia.
I need your car.
We're both very busy.
They recognized him.
Tom wears white pants.
Tell Tom we're ready.
Can I talk to the doctor?
When I was sick, Tom passed by and ate dinner for me.
I love her and she loves me.
Were you happy?
Our teacher is an idiot.
Thomas is fishing.
You're eating, please.
I was asked to resign from the company.
Tom's talking fast.
He doesn't want me to talk about this.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I'm very strict about that.
Where's Paris?
You're stronger than that.
Her mother lives alone in the basement.
Tom should have learned French.
I have to hide.
You don't understand women, Tom.
Tom loves baseball.
Let Tom sleep.
Tom's good at math.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
You're not gonna find us.
I'm not sure.

Everybody's talking about you.
No, that's all.
Tom knows the truth.
Keep your breath.
I'll read it.
Did you think I was Canadian?
Get some water.

I can't believe Tom ate all his own chicken.
Are you ready for the opening?
Tell her you're not ready.
Is Larry home?
We'll try again.
Julia's mother tongue is Italian.
That'll help.
I fooled them.
We're all Canadians.
I can't forget her.
Tom's not staying here anymore.
I'm not in Tom's place.
Why didn't you warn Tom?
Tom terrorized Mary.
I visit Algeria often.
Where are you going, Tom?
You'll regret it!
Religion is a controversial issue for many people.
I don't approve of his behavior.
I'll wait for you at 2:30.
Most of them are Canadians.
Tom will forgive you.
Stop her.
