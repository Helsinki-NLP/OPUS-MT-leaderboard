The members of the Wales Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility of being "accompanied as weapons"
Part of the members of the assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Wales Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Velsa Parliament).
AM is concerned throughout the political spectrum that it can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Leiborist Party AM explained that their group is concerned with "recording with the words Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: The Welsh language means "twp" means "unitis", but "pwp" means "coke".
The Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "unsatisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Wales Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "aver".
In this context, account should be taken of the fact that the English word "w" is spoken similar to the English dialect of Yorkshire "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing for the amendment of the name of the draft legislation, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used for the appointment of members of the Assembly must, of course, be adopted by the Assembly itself."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals, which provided broad support for the change of the Assembly's name to the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the name AM, the Commission gave preference to the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the highest support in the public consultation.
The AM clearly recommends alternative options, but the fight for an agreement can provide headaches to the headmaster of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will take place when the legislation has been discussed.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of national name
The vote will take place on Sunday, whether their country name will be changed to the North Macedonia Republic.
The referendum was organised to resolve the long-standing disputes between Greece and the neighbouring province of Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long claimed that the name of the northern neighbour has made an impression on claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed the request of Macedonia to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov (Gjorge Ivanov), one of the plebiscite on the name changers, announced that by ignoring the vote.
However, the rapporteurs, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that the change of name is simply a matter to be done to establish the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's call to hear the Church of Harlem fight for existence.
"As the old people I've been talking to have been on every street before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's not one anymore, not another."
He recognizes that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"There's no more room to live in, which people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives when selling property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return at the beginning".
Goddess, he added, may be replaced by multidwelling buildings with apartments where people who will not help the rest of the shrines will live.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus will be the day when these gods will turn on all times, because it is unlikely that most of the people who gather in these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both deities were raised by the white congregation, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s 10 years later.
The original white Methodists ’ association was abandoned in the 1930 ’ s.
The building took over the black congregation, which had been close to God.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin’s goddess took over his blessing at John Howard Johnson. He led a small shopkeeper’s boycott at 125th Street, Harlem, who had refused to take up employment in blacks or to grant them a promotion.
The fire broke down the building in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His blessing is David Johnson, father Johnson's son, followed by St. Martin's congregation, with pride called the game "for poor people's calls".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "Cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger call game in the Church of Riversaid.
Mr. Merivezer (Merriweather) said that the St. Martin's congregation did not stop him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s goddess reflected the relationship between the architects and the builders, some of whom were engaged in the work of a temporary authority, and others of the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, which is composed of temporary leaders, addressed the diocese in writing with concern that the diocese "will try to pay the costs" to the council, although the Council has not been involved in the determination of the architects and builders sent the deocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the day - to - day activities.
The shark injured 13-year-olds in the omar fishing area
Hayivs attacked a 13-year-old boy in California and injured him. It was the first day of the Omar season, a storyteller.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel's (Chad Hammel) informed the KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had a kidney about half an hour in the morning when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then the group went to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a thrill for the nailed omar, but then he "understands that the boy screams" told me!
I'm sorry!"
All of his key bones were loosened," Hammels, who immediately noticed when he had gone to the boy.
"I knelt to leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Reidia (Rady) Children’s Hospital, Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of infested shark is unknown.
In a speech by Captain Larry Giles, the media reported that a few weeks earlier, a shark was observed in this area, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the rumpet.
Officials for investigation time and security for 48 hours closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca (Casablad), to Swami (Swami's) Encinitas (Encinitas).
Jails pointed out that more than 135 species of sharks are found in this area, but most are not considered dangerous for humans.
"Sainsbury's" plans to impress the UK industry's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" goes in attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal-style beauty products for hair rows and trained sellers.
As part of the significant contribution of the United Kingdom to the large beauty market of 2.8 billion brands, which continues to grow, although fashion goods and household items will decrease, there will be an increase in the number of beauty products in 11 shops in the country, and if all tracks succeed, the next year there will be more such stores.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when the wholesaler is looking for opportunities to use hairs that were previously allowed for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" announced that they would double their offers in the field of beauty collection up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand areas similar to those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its "Boutique" decorative cosmetic line, where most products will be friendly to vegans, which are increasingly required by younger customers in the years.
In addition, the wholesaler "Fragrance Shop" will try the concession in two "Sainsbury's" shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, but the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to small food purchases every day in local stores means that wholesalers need to invest more in order to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's Executive Director, Mike Coupe, has said that the trade places of the goods will become more and more like universal goods, because the store chain is trying to fight with the discount shops "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has been located in several hundred shops in Argos and has opened several "Habitats" since buying both chains two years ago, which, as it is claimed, has improved the sales volumes and made the goods more profitable.
The previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with a fall.
The "Sainsbury's" joint venture with the "Boots" was tried in early 2000, but the Union went out after a struggle to share income from the pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after "Sainsbury's" 3 years ago sells its 281 large pharmaceutical business "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" to the owner of the chain of 125 million brands.
According to this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with supplementing the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), Business Director "Sainsbury's" said, "In order to improve the intended environment for customers, we have transformed the look of the hairline of our beauty products and the impression they produce.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment, together with a comfortable location, means that we are now a curious target on the way to beauty, a goal that calls for past purchases."
Peter Jones "full of nothing" after Holly Viloubia's refusal to pay 11 million bills
"Dragon D" star Peter Jones "takes over nothing" after Holly Willoughby, TV broadcast leader Hollia Willoughby, turned down 11 million stamps with his lifestyle brand to pay all attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowbia has no time to devote their home clothes and accessories to the "Truly" brand.
The two businesses were compared to the Guineat Paltrow (Gwyneth Paltrow) label "Goop".
"This Morning" 37 years old broadcaster used Instagram to report that she's leaving.
Hollija Viloubia has left the "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones in anger, for the last moment he got out of his profitable lifestyle brand business – to pay all attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of nothing", when the TV golden girl was shut down at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million marks, mean that she no longer had time to devote to their home clothing and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Guinea Stratrov, and according to the house, it twice increases the wealth of Viloubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million mark.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to report that she left "Truly", Jones withdrew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truly" was the main priority of the Netherlands.
This was to become her long - term future, which would be devoted to the next decade.
Their decision to stay away surprised all the unintended parties involved.
No one was able to believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlov is a warehouse for the sale of ready goods."
Experts believe that the leaders of "This Morning", one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions away from the company, as a lot of funds have been invested in various products, ranging from mirrors and candles, to clothing and goods at home, and will be even more late for placing them on the market.
And it can mean long - term endings of friendship.
Three children’s mother, Willoubia, and her husband, Den Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
"Truly" was set up with Keppu in 2016, and 52 years old Jones joined the president in March.
Both of them spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the Baldvina TV company.
Willowbia has to become a brand M&S ambassador, and she will replace Entu Makpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as ITV leader "I'm A Celebrity".
"We don't want to comment on his business."
A serious conversation "and then we loved"
He was concerned about the criticism he would receive from the news companies about a comment that some may consider to be "inevitable to the President", and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is the president so much as to give up?
Tramps said in his imaginary "deputy dictator" vote.
"I don't give a damn how!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Tramps recognized their initial meeting in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's denuclerization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Yongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US 'responsibility' towards the initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
The tramp was much more optimistic in his house talk.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were preparing to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these wonderful relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results — the cessation of missile testing, the relief of the recipients, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's just to make the President's impression, but instead of standing there for 10,000 people out there who are trying to enter this area closely, we have 200, here," Tramps said, pointing directly to him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia land the island, killing hundreds of people
According to the Lomboka earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the people of Lomboka were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not announced, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have said very clearly that they do not ask for international help, so it is a known problem," the new kunda (Sombung) acknowledged.
Although "Save the children" collects groups to drive to Paul, it is still not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work there.
The representative of the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that the Indonesian officials were appraised by the position of Paul to see if the international agencies could make their contribution.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.
Although Aceh (Aceh) has been established in cases of paravertic tsunamis, these occur rarely along other coasts.
Most likely, the destruction of the people also struck Paul’s failure to heed the warning of the tsunami, even though the warning was in force.
Even the most favorable times between the many islands of Indonesia are a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship hospital, which had settled in Lombo to treat earthquake victims, now goes to Paul, but will need at least three days to achieve new job victims.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) had made the improvement of Indonesia's lost infrastructure a central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has taught the administration of Mr. Jocko, and he expects to be re-elected next year.
Moreover, Mr. Joko has to face the pressing problem of tension between sections of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while the Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using cats, bows, and bullets, and other primitive weapons.

Kromvela statue in parliament becomes the latest "historic rewriting" scandal
The rejection of it would be ethically justified in view of the activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in its fanatic Puritan followers burying so many memories of English culture and religion.
However, the Kromvela Society described Mr. Krika (Crick)'s proposal as "multitude" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Kromvel's company, said: "In view of the current debate on the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the goal would also be to become the figure of Oliver Kromvel outside the city of Westminster.
Cromwell himself neither ordered to do it nor carried out the slaughter of candles during the war of the English citizens.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of his past actions in the past century.
The magnificent image of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Ser William William Viljama Sorneicroft shows a 19th - century view and is part of the history of a person who, as many people believe, is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many Crovells, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, were more than today, were considered a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy.
Historical discussions will continue on whether it is really a completely accurate picture of the theme.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the future development of our nation, and Kromvels is a well-known person who represents one of the parties to the long-term distinction.
She has achieved, being a Lord's protector, is worth praising and mentioning."
Porcine-sugar to the death of the farmer in China
According to information, the domestic media in the pig market attacked and killed the farmer in the south-west of China.
The man — mentioned only by his name Juan (Yuan) — was found dead with a sudden artery, all in one blood at a pig’s throat market in Liupanshui in Guidjo (Guizhou) province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pigs are prepared to inject vaccines into pigs in China (Xining) Province of China (Qinghai) on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had returned from the neighbouring province of Junjana on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found a man dead and found that the door of the nearby pigs was open.
He told me that the pig’s body contained a large pig’s father with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the court’s medical investigation confirmed that the severe fever of 550 pounds (~249 kg) had left the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother, "only his name was named Vu (Wu), written by "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juans enters the market at around 4.40 p.m. about Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong to him or to his brother.
The market manager informed "Evening News", that the wire was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police picked up evidence instead of the event.
According to information, the Black family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other swine attacks are known to occur in humans.
In 2016, pigs attacked women and men at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
Just 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pigs in Wells had been pushed by farmers to the tractor until the animals killed his wife.
After the farmers in Oregon in 2012, his pigs were eaten by a farmer in Manitoba "CBC News" explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act as a gun shot.
"They're just playful.
They like to intrude, they're very clever... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orkana Rosa's conclusion brings a wide and powerful case to the south-west of the United States
As foretold, the hurricane of Rosa, moving across the coolest waters on the coasts of northern Mexico, will weaken.
However, in the coming days, Roza will bring rain-producing rains to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States.
In the afternoon (after North America’s time) the pink windmills reached 143 km/h (in the hour of July 85) corresponding to category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) south of Punta Eugenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, there is a low pressure inlet moving east towards the eastern coast of the United States. For pink with tropical wind power approaching the Gulf of California (Baja California), it will begin to move deep moisture mass from the tropical strip north towards the south of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25,4 cm) of rain in Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture, then, interacting with the nearby low pressure inlet, will establish a wide, powerful rainforest area in the south-west during the next few days.
1 to 4 inches (~2,6 to 10,2 cm) in the rains will cause dangerous sudden floods, double currents and possibly dust.
Moisture from the tropical zone will result in rain gases reaching between 2 and 3 inches per hour (~5,1 to 7,6 cm), especially in the south of Nevada and the Arizona.
In the south-west part, in particular in the majority of Arizona, there are expected to be up to 24 inches (~5,2 to 10,1 cm).
There are possible sudden floods with rapid deterioration of the situation due to the spread of tropical rainstorms.
It is very undesirable to walk in the wilderness because of tropical rainstorms.
Strong rains can turn cannons into swift rivers, but they will soon bring local breezes and sand storms.
The low pressure will bring the local strong line of the South California coast closer to the scene.
There are possible rain gases that together exceed half a inch (~1.3 cm), and this may result in small duplex flows and runways.
It will be the region's first rainy season.
Individual distributed tropical rainstorms for Arizona will begin to approach late Sunday and early Monday before the rains take over a wider area later Monday and late Tuesday.
Strong rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Streets region (DR Colorado, DA Jūta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and long throughout Wednesday.
In October there are possible fluctuations of intense temperatures throughout the United States, as Arctic temperatures are falling, but tropicals are still quite warm.
This sometimes causes dramatic changes in the temperature in a small distance.
This is an example of the dramatic differences in temperature in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Egypt, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demoina (Des Moines), Aiov, differs from almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, it will try to form and spread a long summer heat.
It is expected that most of the U.S. central and eastern parts will begin in October with a temperature of 80 degrees and more (by Farrenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia) in large areas from south to north-east.
Temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (by Farrenhet; ~27 degrees after Celssia), which would exceed about 10 degrees on average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate that the first half of October will be above average in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people were heard in the Breta Caveno case
More than 20 million people in the six television channels on Thursday were thrilled to see what the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Kristina Blezija Forda, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, said in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, political unsolved efforts continued to cease regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement of Senator Jeff Fleik (Jeff Flake) of Arizona that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had buried them in their drink and tried to pull clothes during high school graduations.
The coffee unscrupulously showed that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report on Friday, it was seen by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interests of the average viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually presents problems, including people who are looking at offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of exclusion games or the number of Oskara ceremony observers.
"Fox News Channel", whose commentators have been committed to supporting the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest number of viewers, on average 5.69 million during the long hearing of the day, reported "Nielsen".
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS joined 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC — 2.89 million, and CNN — 2.52 million, reported "Nielsen".
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Fleek was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican team had issued a statement that he was voting on the appointment of Caveno, the senator noticed the CNN and the CBS camera on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the protestors' group, tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
In the live broadcast CNN he stood for several minutes with his eyes pierced as he was buried.
"I'm standing right here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have authority until so many women are powerless."
Fleek explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was informed that he had something else to say at the Committee's hearing.
The cable networks and broadcasters were reflected in the live broadcast several hours later when the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the opening of the Kaveno vote in the Senate.
However, Fleke claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look at the complaints made by the candidate, which was requested by a minority of Democrats next week.
Fleuk was partly convinced of the negotiations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After the discussion with Kúns and several other senators, Fleke made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that the Republics would not have a vote to approve the Caveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate allegations brought against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games due to Brexit
Prime Minister Tereza Meja, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people who criticised her plan to leave the European Union, accused "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
UK Prime Minister Tereza Meja attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, also near the interview with their newspaper on the first page, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Jones continues to attack her Brexit Plan on the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, the so-called 'Checkers Plan', stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "completely absurd".
Type Sims shot: police have arrested Diteon Simpson, who is suspected of killing the LSU player
Police have been arrested in suspicion of the killing of Wade Sims (Wayde Sims), 20 years old LSU basketballist.
The 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge reported.
The official released a video showing Simsa’s clash with Simpson, and the police said that Simss lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS daughter WAFB reports that police glasses were found in the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After understanding Simpson, the police informed him that he had been admitted to killing the Way.
As the lawyer reports, he received $3500,000 in security.
East Baton Rouge Parish, a team of judges from the East Baton Rouge Parish, issued a temporary closure on Friday, stating that death was the cause of a bullet in the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group for the search for police refugees from the state of Louisiana, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the people of the territory for assistance in the investigation that resulted in the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial legislators for their "religion and work on behalf of justice".
Simss was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) long booster grew up in Baton Rouge, where her father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, he won on average 5,6 points and 2,6 dropped bombs.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team is "striking" and "shocked" about the type of death.
"That's what people always worry about," said the Type.
Vulcans splinter their profits over Mexico
The trees that rise from Pokatepetl volcano have reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
After an activity was observed in the container and 183 gas and profit emissions were recorded during 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans that they should not approach the volcano.
The centre was observed for multiple sweating and sweating.
The images on social networks showed that the car windmill in Mexico, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), is covered with a plan profit layer.
Geophysics have observed 45 nautical miles (72 km) south-east of the activation of the existing volcano in the capital, since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake devastated the central part of Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the clash of independence-supported protestors with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising decommissioning vote in Catalonia.
The group’s masked standby supporters, who were delayed by the public order police, fed them with eggs and dyed them with powdery paint, forming dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Inconsistency was also followed, and policemen used sticks to prevent fights.
Several hours of independence groups of supporters, singing: "Don't forget and don't forgive!", were involved in confrontation with unity-supported protestors, who sang: "Long life for Spain!"
As reported in the local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance due to minor injuries during the protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which the Catalans proclaimed, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a major tension.
The voters were convinced that independence was expressed, although the electoral activity was low, and the majority of the voters were opposed to separation.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at the polls throughout the region, and there were violent clashes.
Independent support groups had been deployed on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another path.
Narciss Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer believed that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting Catalonia's independence won the regional elections last year with a small but significant advantage, these parties have struggled to maintain the movement this year, as many of the most famous leaders have either emigrated, or have been arrested and awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puig (Joan Puig), who filmed on the phone to support the protest police, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The judgment is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriols Žnkerez (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in prison for the previous year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Denomination of the European will is the best way of reversing democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has brought against us," he said.
Londonderija: Men arrested after car crashing in the building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was hit several times against a building in Londonderia.
The incident occurred at Balinagard Crescent about 7.30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bobs Blemings reported that the doors were damaged and the building itself.
At the same time, the machine may have been fired from the aircraft.
The Mengas Triangle lets "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the first doorkeeper to win Livingston
"Livingston's-backed "Rangers" was adjourned by Steven Gerrard in his second loss in 18 games, played by the Ibrox Club Manager.
Dollija Mengas's strike turned out to be decisive because Gerija Holta (Gary Holt) team compared the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team did not win this championship season, and next weekend they have to meet the Hearts leader, from which they are left for eight points.
Before that, the European League's "Rangers" took Vienna's "Rapid" on Thursday.
Meanwhile, "Livingston" extended its series without loss in the division to six games, and the main coach Holts has not yet felt the taste of grief, since last month he replaced Keny Miller (Kenny Miller).
Livingston does not take advantage of the possibility of blasphemous guests
Holta team with their direct game, which in every way made it difficult for "Rangers", had to be in control for a long time before they got their names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but pulled his attempt at the door, then Alan Litgow’s attempt to get in the feet to delay Craig Halkett’s head through the door line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests in the planned places.
And that is exactly how the decisive gates came to be.
"Rangers" allowed freedom, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinson joined to provide the opportunity for Menga to sit and win gates from the middle of the area.
At this stage, Rangers managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests proved to be insurmountable and the port guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly).
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) had Kelly rescue the gates.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop the activity of the Rangers Guard Alan Makgregor, and Lithuania postponed the long doors in Livingston combination.
The Livingston area continued to show the central bombs, but two calls for a sentence — after Halket fighting for a bomb with the replacement Glenn Middleton (Glenn Middleton) and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Fenmenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamonts in Tony Macaroni arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was great by continuing to keep up with the hope of getting better.
Their game style and personality have practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but a great praise has earned Holts for how he has launched the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkets (Halkett) was a giant in maintaining pre-organized protection, while Menga was making sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Warral were always wise.
But the rangers lack inspiration.
No matter how well they were sometimes subject to Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last bomb was temporary — only once they entered the part of the farm area — and it is essentially an invitation to withdraw "Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for shared feelings in Čelna
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO citizens.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Khelni to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, for reasons of security, blocked the 25 000 people's efforts, not to allow themselves to be gathered in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — a large part of them were Kurds — also made known their attitude by condemning both the Erdogan policy and the German government’s decision to take it to themselves.
The mutual protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions that have been created by the guest, whose part of the German Turk is considered a hero, but others are nothing like an autocrat.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies in a car crash
In Sadrusm, a car in London was damaged by a bike driver.
Sedursme took place on the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, on the road with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the southeastern city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the doctor provided help, but the man stopped at the scene.
Sedursme took place several months after another biker on the Childers Street Street, about a year after the crash site was destroyed by the driver.
The chief police department reported that police officers were involved in identifying the man and informing his neighbors.
In place of the event, there are closed roads and bus routes, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during an accident
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in an irregularly severe men’s regime in prison.
The riots occurred in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vorchester at around 09.30 BST on Sunday and will still continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners who are confined to a single line, the staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved.
The workers were treated with mild facial trauma instead of the event.
The representative of the prison department said: "In order to resolve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be transferred to the police and perhaps spend more time behind the rest."
The "HMP Long Lartin" prison consists of more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison officer was being treated in a hospital after the arrest of a prisoner.
And last October, the workers responsible for dumping were sent to prison to resolve the serious irregularities in which the staff had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orkáns Roza Féniks, Lasveggas and Soltleksitia are threatened by sudden floods (probably will benefit affected areas of drought)
Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early next week, when the Orkan Rosa with the remaining power moves across the desert south, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, in the south and east of Nevada, in the south-east of California, and in the south-east of Jute, including Féniks, Flagstafu, Lasvegas and Soltleksitia.
It is expected that on Tuesday, Rosa will move directly to Phoenix with a case later on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Féniks Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind or depression status in the 200-journey (320 km) radius from Féniks!
Katrina was an Orkan 40 yards (65 km) from the AZ border in 1967."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) predict 2-4 inches (~5.08-10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching in some places even 6 inches (15.24 cm).
Other areas of the south-west forest, including the central part of the Klinš mountain and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5,08 cm), reaching in some places even 4 inches (~10,2 cm).
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Roses may become a blessing because the region has been visited by droughts.
Although the possibility of landing causes very serious concerns, some of the rainfalls may be of benefit because the south-east is now suffering from drought.
According to Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is another higher category, reported weather.com.
First of all, Orkan Rosa’s route leads to Leja California (Baja California) in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa is still with Orkan's power on Sunday morning at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km), is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Ejhenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north at 12 miles (19 km) in the hour.
The wind meets with the warmer waters of the Pacific and is therefore accessible.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with tropical wind will reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the part of the gas, Mexico can be powerful by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the gas will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from the south-west of Sonora in Lower California, possibly by reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical wind, and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive on the southern side of the city on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very strong rainstorms in Lower California, northern Sonora and in the South-East," said the National Centre of Orkan.
This rain is expected to lead to life’s dangerous sudden floods and floods in the wilderness, and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder

The injured adolescent was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4.00 BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
The police reported that 17 years of age and two 18 years of age, as well as 20 years of age, were arrested by night in Redstock, Eivo and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who could have a mobile phone material for what happened.
Tramps claim that Kaveno is hard on the "evil and angry" party of the Democratic Party
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the rude and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Wiling (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno is stuck with the "evil and angry" party during his entire nomination process.
Kaveno pointed out to Congress, where she strongly and emotionally rejected any Christian Blaisey Ford’s charge of sexual harassment several decades ago, when both were young.
Forda also testified during the hearing of his accusations.
On Saturday, the president announced that today, "Americans have seen" Kaveno "Elevation, Capacity and Courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a history of serving the people," he announced the support efforts in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the environment in terms of the importance of the activities of Republicans in the mid-term.
"The next week to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't expect it, but I really did run," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps argued that the Democrats have taken the mission "to protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the main proceedings of the Senate on the appointment of Caveno will take place not later than Friday, the CNN informed the senior assistant of the Republican party's management.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were simply destroyed when giant waves came across the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.
On Friday at the festival in the city of Palu, hundreds of people were gathered on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves were blowing against the shore of the table, killing many and destroying all who were on their way.
Cunami was fired after 7.5 balloons of powerful earthquake.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still working on the beach and were not running away right away, and they became victims," BNPB representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) reported in a letter in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, balks and buildings, it loved everything that was on the ground," Nugoro told, adding that the tsunami, before crossing the coast, had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people crawled in trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
The photographs taken by the crash agency show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and demolished bridges, and water-covered mosquitoes.
After the harvest, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the territory of 2.4 million people.
In the BPPT Communication, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency stressed that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than that of the 2nd World War on the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima.
The location of the city was long, possibly at the end of the narrow tower to enhance the tsunami.
Nugroho's posts were described as "wide" and reported that they have destroyed thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho recognized that the number of victims and entrys could be more along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross reported, adding that its personnel and volunteers are going to the affected regions of the disaster.
"Now it is a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization reported.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami had visited Paul, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived during the announcement of the warning.
The video distributed in the social networks is heard that the man on the upper floor is sometimes called people on the bottom of the street, approaching the tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the water wall will crack against the shore, removing buildings and machines.
The news agency "Reuters" is unable to immediately confirm whether the material is real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electropaede, which left the communication of Paul, making it difficult for officials to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Officials reported that the army has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other first necessities.
The city airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vido (Joko Widodo) was planning to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseb (Doseb) said that the World Vision staff who had successfully reached the city of Paul from Dongala, and now had a long drive to the office in the vicinity of our bazaars.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were broken," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams have begun to organize disaster relief aid, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel with great experience to Paul.
Under Indonesia's legislation, the financing of foreign organisations, resources and personnel will only be allowed to enter if the postal area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said the Indonesian Red Cross representative Aulia Ariani (Aulia Arriani).
"When the government announces, "Well, it is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but such status has not yet been established."
When Paul arrived on the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members were still not found, hoping that his love would become a miracle that would make life more pleasant during the natural disaster.
A small boy was taken out of the shed on Saturday.
On Sunday, a woman was released from prison, who had been put under the rubble for two days, near her mother’s corpse.
Gendon Subandon (Gendon Subandon), a coach of the Indonesian National Paraglomerates team, had prepared two of the uninvited paraglomerates for the Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others from Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their breeders.
"As we experienced the paraglider," he said, "I'm learning the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was distributed to the paragliding team, he sent the "WhatsApp" reports to participants who participated in the beach festival for hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one square note, not two blue marks.
"The judge, that means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
The coal fell 26 750 dollars in the Newport on the Levee complex during the filling of the ATM.
According to the Newport Police Department's announcement, the deposit box was made on Friday from the morning to a staff member of the Brink's, who filled out the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The car driver emptied the ATM entertainment complex and had prepared to fill it with more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another person "from the back hit the Brink's employee" and raised a sum of money for the ATM.
According to the press release, several suspects who left their crime scene were observed, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the NYPD 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the reprisal changes its name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (J).
Speaking of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Boutne, who previously known as Kanji Vestu."
41 years old West was already called Je, and used the name of his eighth album published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in this "Saturday Night Live," where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
The authors of this story say that he replaces the singer Arian Grandi, who has stopped the work of "emotional Causes".
Vests has said that it is not only a reduction in his current professional name, but also a religious one.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," Vest explained earlier this year, discussing his album name with the radio driver Big Boy (Big Boy).
"Then I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought of good and bad in ours, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more concerned about what we are."
He is one of several famous repertoires who have changed his name.
Sean Combs, who was known so far as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother of Love).
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with the Vest, even though he did not use the thought mark and great letters.
The elected President of Mexico bids not to use the army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the bloody return of the students.
Lopess Obador's Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by the army unit was destroyed, killing up to 300 people during the time the left-wing movement of the students spread throughout Latin America.
Lopess Obadors has vowed to support new Mexicans in the years, each month to grant grants to students and to open more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education could lead young criminals into gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various US government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks strategies in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, last year China launched its plan: its goal is to become the country’s leading in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The double budget for artistic intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries have so much left behind in the United States, and there is expected to be the next cardinal development in the field of artistic intelligence," Li said.
In the CNBC interview this week, Li said that double funding could double the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the USA.
Li, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month, "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is the Executive Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested funds in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies "Face+".
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) University to establish an artistic intelligence system that would cross the America's best "Othello" (Revers ) player, but later he was a leading "Microsoft Research" employee and the president of the Chinese branch.
Lī recognised the previous technology competition organised by the U.S. government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when it will be prepared in the future to identify people with ideas about the future.
"Scientists often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," says Lee.
"It is not China that attracts leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have spent the last few years working in universities for artistic intelligence.
Li added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically allocated to people with a degree in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China published its next generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
Li explained that the Chinese National Natural Sciences Fund provides funding to people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence (U.S. Defence Department) established a joint art intelligence centre, which aims to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artistic intelligence.
And this month DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the Ministry of Defence) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Fund, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence studies.
In the meantime, US legislation, whose task was to set up the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence (National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence) has not worked for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change of national name
The citizens of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonian Republic" by taking steps to prevent the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name shows claims to its territory and has imposed veto on NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the changes in the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonia be affected.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with the invitation to boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The reference note asks the question: "Are you participating in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
The sponsors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object to the fact that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as EU and NATO members.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely, in the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The National Election Commission informed that no violations were reported by one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and his son, in his referendum in Duško, Macedonia, moved to Strumica on 30 September 2018 to Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small audience and arranged chairs at the tents that had been placed in the boycotts of the referendum.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with an elevated head, not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs claims that NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is above 20 per cent.
"I believe most will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) shows that 30 to 43 per cent of the voter will take part in the referendum, less than the necessary activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 per cent of the vote is scheduled to take place on Sunday.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electorate's activity must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
Go to: Manchestras "City" Sergio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) goes through the entire "Brightton" protection to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Rahím Sterling (Raheem Sterling) carried out the protection of "Brightton" by allowing Manchester's "City" Saturday "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win by 2:0.
Agvero was impressed that his win at 65 minutes was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian climber received a boost at the beginning of the combination in the middle of the field.
He scurried between the three "Brightton" shields, and went into the free field.
Then Agvero hugs four green cracks.
He brought the bomb to one guard, then the running power of several more on the brightton field.
Then he made a left strike to reach Sterling.
The English center's climber used his first sticker to play back Agvero, who put in the case a good football frog to strike the "Brigton" gateguard Metjū Rayen (Mathew Ryan), hitting the right side of the bomb network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot-and-step problems," the manager of Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed playing with them for 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were glad he got the gates at the time.
But it was Sterling that provided the original advantage of Sky Blues in the Premiery moment.
The gate was reached in 29 minutes.
Agvero played the ball in the area of Brighton.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful stone along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Several seats were taken in the sand until he trusted Sterling to deliver the bomb to the next gate stop.
The Sky Blues Centre's jumper easily entered the bomb network just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with the "Hoffenheim" Championship League Games Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinshaim, Germany.
Shercer wants to get the "Rockies" problem.
Since "Nationals" did not participate in exclusion games, there was no reason to restart.
But Chercers (Scherzer), who is always ready to try, hopes to use the opportunity against the Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be the current exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National League Western Group is headed by one game against Los Angeles "Doggers".
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with a Friday evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but has not yet received its first title in division.
"Even if we're playing the same game, we'll at least be able to have fun knowing that the air here, in Denver, with the effort and second team, will probably be the most exciting thing I'll ever meet this year.
And why would I not want to fight then?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced which will start the game on Sunday, but, as the news says, is ready to allow Shercer to make a year.
Shercer, with which it will begin at 34th day, held an annual session in the "bullpen" part of the outdoor area, and would throw a bomb during the regular holiday.
The Washington laboratory is 18 - 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 slots 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tramps hold myths in West Virginia
The president mentioned the situation in which his elected High Court candidate, Brets Caveno, spoke at the same time about the importance of the activities of the Republican voters in the interim election.
"In November everything we have done is under threat.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is really very, very serious — I did not expect, but I did, and that is why I am everywhere and I am fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this ugly, ugly group of radicals that is acting right now.
And they have committed themselves to regaining power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the opposite.
They have the same thing as they do, which they have to violate to gain power and control, which is why they want power and control, and we won't do it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken the mission "to protest and resist".
"And you have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "unrighteous, evil, evil and false".
On behalf of the Senate Judicial Committee, he called Senators of the Democratic Party of the Democratic Party of Dianne Feinstein, which the observers responded to with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait – it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is inexcusable to the public
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
Finally, I am the last member of the Parliament of the Lebanese Party to this end, who has been informed that he is not willing, because we are not hiding our opinion.
My colleagues in Parliament, Joan Rayen (Joan Ryan), walked the same way because she was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, of national security, of Europe — ironically, but they were issues in which Jeremiah did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Leiborist Meeting in the part east of Nottingema said on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my local Lebanese MP were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the air is different and promises of a "better, safer" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become more and more clear that the Leiborist party does not want to suffer from different opinions, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for party management.
This began shortly after Jeremiah became the leader: colleagues who I think our political views are similar began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never agree on in other cases, whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly — and it is not really important what I am saying — the following study on social networking, calling for a ban on future elections by re-launching the centre’s policy, claiming that I have no place in the Leiborist party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have done more than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I have made are usually political.
I was amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who are faced with each day's sexist and racist insults, but never reluctant to avoid them.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin announced that the Leiborist party had to pick up a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of views, and with each expression of uncertainty or change of the rules of choice, the party will fail.
In the last two years, I've often been given advice by asking not to give up, to think what I'm saying, and then with me "everything will be fine."
But that is not why I have decided to take part in politics.
Since I joined the Leborist back 32 years as a teacher, responding to the rejection of the Techerian government, which had literally led to the collapse of my integrated school class, I have been tasked with fighting for better public services for those who are most needed — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor the previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingema had any reason to doubt my position on policy issues and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
For those who made a proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is going to be committed to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist party.
But essentially the only thing I want to say is not that of Nottingema Momentum, but for its voters regardless of whether they are Lebanese members: I am proud that I can serve you, and I pledge that there is no danger of being called on or reminded that no one in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for you all.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unsay "Ayr" reaches the top line table
The last two attempts may be to some extent the final outcome of the match, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has won to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish championship today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unspoken team of ten.
Finally, it was both their great protection and the use of much better opportunities that led the owners, and coach Peter Martyr (Peter Murchie) is all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've checked all of our games and we're still not dead, so I have to rejoice," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristius (Robyn Christie): "All respect "Ayr", they used their advantages better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, made by Frazier Klimo (Frazier Climo), made "Ayr", but the yellow card for Captain Rory Hughes (Rory Hughes), where the "Warriors" was awarded, changed the "Melrose" numbers, and Jason Begots (Jason Baggot) recorded an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased the management of "Ayr" with punishment, right at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, so that the "Ayr" stopped with 17-5.
However, the Melrose half-life began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begot made, reduced the retreat to 5 points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruuris Nott (Ruurid Knott) had a severe trauma and was taken to the stand away from the field, but when the game began "Ayr" quickly turned forward when Staford Makdovels (Stafford McDowall) did the attempt made by Klimo.
The existing Captain Bleirs Makferson (Blair Macpherson) then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used the remaining player — with Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the owners settled, and when Struan Hachinson (Struan Hutchinson) received the yellow card for crossing the Klimo without a bomb, from the court corridor, Makfersons made an appointment in the back of the "Ayr" mill.
As was the case in the past, almost from the very beginning after Kyle Rowe took over David Armstrong's sword and sent the flag player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the owners.
Still Game star, it seems, is planning a new career restaurant in business
Ford Kiernan (Ford Kieran), a comedy series "Stil Game" star, appears to be planning to take part in the hospitality business, as he was found to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56 years old actor Jack Jarvis plays at the popular BBC show he's making, which he and his old partners are playing with Greg Hemphyll.
The duet has announced that the next nine season will be the last one, and Kirnan obviously plans his life after Kreiglang (Craglang).
According to official information, he is the Director of the Agriturismo Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan was planning to participate in the "walking restaurant" of Glázgov.
"The sea belongs to us!": the landless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol around the densely dressed Fleets in the Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the ocean blue flags.
Fleet-based vessels from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are dashed with a visa: "We have the right to the sea.
Its recovery is our duty."
The memory of Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict on the lost coast line still alive in Bolivia, just as it has been in the Pacific for a long time.
This hope has been possible for the most recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia develops, in its own spirit is united and peaceful, and, of course, with positive thoughts, expects the outcome," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many residents will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile is obliged to discuss the granting of sovereign sea exits to Bolivia.
President Evo Morales (Evo Morales) of Bolivia, who is expected to face a struggle against re-election the following year, is also very interested in the Monday's judgment.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment of the Court of Justice for the benefit of Bolivia is unlikely and, even if it is adopted, there are no major changes to be expected.
In the Netherlands, the based UN body does not have the power to grant Chile’s territory, and its representatives have stated that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's judgment is taken no more than six months after the final hearing shows that the case was "not complicated", explained international legislator Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And for the last four years, the Bolivian case has not moved forward, but, on the contrary, has been delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been addressed by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morale’s military rhetoric has blinded the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will often continue to negotiate, but then it will be very difficult to hold the debate.
Both countries have not exchanged consignments since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, who was once President Edward Rodríguez Veltz, did not agree that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will take "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "add a point 139 years to the long conflicts from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used sea problems as a political crucifix.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to know what to do to overcome the past."
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only when you can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) said that his people would never first eliminate their nuclear weapons if you could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises expressed by the two leaders in Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) is ready to resume diplomatic measures on the road to nuclear failure, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leaders, Kimu Chennu.
Ri claims that they are "fights" to hope that the United States is still unresolved of sanctions and unwilling to declare the end of the Korean war, will ever get North Korea on its way.
Washington is careful with regard to the declaration of approval before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Tramps want a second meeting.
But many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon, whose country is probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan in the next month to prepare the next Kim meeting with Tramp.
Paris fashions show this with the latest massive headline on your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented viewers with a line of absurdity, huge on the head-to-head item in the spring/feast season 2019 collection, which gleamed on the Paris Fashion Week-style background.
This summer's highly unpracticed hats have been overloaded by Instagram, and these designers have sent out their fascinating achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most excellent design was a beautiful purple hat with a colour similar broad edge that embraces the head.
Among the massive accessories there were precious garments of beads, magic hats, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange mask — right before Helovine.
Many of the colored masks were glistening lips, and they soon added to Hannibal the Letter, not to high - fashion.
One of the formations reminded us of the breath of the breath, the tube, and the glasses, while the other resembled the conus of experienced sweetness.
And if you want to continue in massive fashion, the time has come.
Styl's observers believe that huge aubs may be on your way to the nearest High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — the salmon hats with two legs (~60 cm) on their sides seem to have all walked from Rianna to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkovski).
The status of very impractical skulls as cult objects in all social networks has led to yet another major act on the lake — the salt beach som, almost as big as a swim-covered dress model that carries it.
The red gold-fibre sum, handled by the African barges and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the spring/summer season collection in the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage explained FEMAIL: "I expect large sums of hats and beaches to appear in the central street shops next summer, as the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is important to the world’s citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has retained it in 2018, when the results of excellent examinations were obtained, which further enhances individual and collective achievements in sports, music and other public events.
The aim of this school, which is attended by a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is to ensure the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it will remain in his mind.
If you speak his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish a relationship and gain confidence in people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's examinations, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams held in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved higher grades.
Scottish Independent School Council data for 74 schools show that 72 percent of the students received the highest score in Chinese A, and 72 percent gained the same score as the German language, 69 percent gained the French and 63 percent gained the Spanish language.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is foreign as vitally important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are evaluated in independent school programmes as high as the objects of a group of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
In 2014, the Commission on Employment and Skills (Commission for Employment and Skills) survey revealed that 17 percent of the employer as a reason for the failure to complete the vacancy was a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly required to prepare young people for their future careers.
To increase the opportunities for working in a language that will require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them real benefits in the future, provided by such a long - term learning.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a number of languages.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey involving more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not understand foreign languages well enough to maintain the conversation, but French was the only language that spoke a double number of people, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to learn the language of their contribution.
A number of languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ from one language to another.
Part of the school will focus more on the most common languages of the day, while other languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of the United Kingdom, will be taught in accordance with plans by 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a number of languages, and teachers will be relevant field specialists.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in order to have a future.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
You must do well (It must).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Independent School Council
Lebron's debt is made up of "Lakers" Sunday Sandjego
Fani has finally waited for the moment when Lebron's first game will take place in Los Angeles' Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets Sandjego.
However, we still have to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton reported on the official website of Lakers.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continued practice this week, James asked about his plans regarding the series of six pre-season games of Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trampa myth in West Virginia Time to go, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramps is starting a series of myths today in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five plots planned for Trampla next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the free space in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the purpose of the trampa is to obtain support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republics will lose control in Congress after the vote was taken in November.
Cicos today will take place in the city of Trampa in West Virginia, and how can it be viewed online?
Trampa village in Villing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trampa Myths in West Virginia You can watch online via YouTube.
Tramps is supposed to be talking about hearing this week in Bret Kaveno, the Supreme Court candidate, who has been in charge of sexual harassment, and the Senate's voting is expected to delay approval for a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this House is to help improve the situation for the Republics expected to be elected in November.
Therefore, President Trampa's campaign shows that this next week's five myths are "activizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to "Reuters".
"Congress control for his agenda is so important that the President will visit the state as much as possible because we start a working campaign season," Trampa campaign representative, who did not want to reveal his name, said "Reuters".
This evening's house, which is planned to be "Wesbanco Arena" in Willingen, will be able to connect supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh's media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month when Tramps will visit Western Virginia, a state in which he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate Patrick Morrisey, a senator of West Virginia, who remains under investigation.
"It's not a good sign to Morris that the president has to come to help improve his findings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Radio Box 2018: The United States has demonstrated its commitment to fight to maintain a great hope for Sunday singles
After three sessions in "one word" afternoon games in the form of "foursome" were possible exactly what this Raider bag needs.
Sportsmen love to talk about success fluctuations, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, which side do they think is a success now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, as I think it means in its own way that success has come to us," said Jordan Spytt (Jordan Speeth) on his way.
Europe, of course, is preferred because it is led by 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spyt explained that Americans believe that the wind blows at their shores and they have reason to optimism, of course, as well as Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points from four.
The spear has been destructive from the first seat of the shield to the hall, and is an example of the winner.
These guitars became louder as his rounds continued, the decisive sitin was performed in the court to reach the same number of sitins four times when he and Thomas had rested on two sitins after two.
His seat in the court, which won his 15th victory, was taken with a similar bell, from them, for his conviction that the American team is not yet exhausted.
"And really have to say deep, and worry about your cat," Spyt said.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 minutes to make a success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spyts and Thomas are French Molinari (Francesco Molinari) and Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood), who will undoubtedly enter this Raider case history.
Europe's strange but attractive couple is left behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molivud was the only couple who went out on Saturday afternoon without bogies, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and at the last nine evenings on Friday mornings.
This move and the way their energy flows to this frustrating effort and again convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Fleetwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun comes through Le Golf National.
Both are invited at the same time in different quarters.
However, the talks about the European triumph were premature.
Babba Vatson (Bubba Watson) and Webs Simpson (Webb Simpson) were soon finished with this morning's fourball hero Sergio García (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
Bogius and the two doubles of the previous nine led Spanish and Swedish cheeses, and they were not even close to cultivating them.
However, there is no one on Sunday that will help us to succeed.
Games "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch in the vicinity due to the interaction of couples, to see what advice they give and what they don't, and how the strategy can change the situation in the future.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days it is in a long run, but this foursome game has shown that the US team is committed to fighting what many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
European selection of Raider bag on the last day is in charge 10-6
The European election will begin on the last day of the Raidera Cup in a pleasant run after Saturday's Fourball and Foursome matches ended in the 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari, were in charge of two victories over the hard-working Taiger Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) European team to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the unprecise American team in the "fourballs" game in the morning, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The United States was more energetic in the form of foursomes, winning two cats, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Farika (Jim Fury) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first year to win four points in a row with Molināri, to be called Mollivud ("Mollivod") after a sensational weekend is only a second couple in the history of the Raider Cup, which won four points in the first four matches.
In the form of "fourballs" in Patrice and Patrick Reed, they then, without any difficulty in the game, struck the weary Woods and American newbies Braison Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with an even more sensitive result 5&4.
The Duke, who played two games on Saturday, showed a great game at times, but he lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break before morning 'fourballs', and returned to partner Henrik Stanson 'foursomes', to say with 2&1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, who take the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe did not fully achieve its own, although the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and easy wind.
The three-time winner of the prestigious golf competition Jordan Spyts and Justin Tomas set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against John Ram (Jon Rahm) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in "fourballs" and returned later to say "Polter and Rory McIlroy" with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two bets.
Only twice in the history of Raider's bag team has played 4 points in a missing single game, but as owners, the Farika (Furky) team is sufficient only with undecided results to preserve the trophy.
After being in the second place two days, it seems, the attack on Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in "no" it would not unblock unilaterally, without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its mistrust to the United States, and in such a situation, North Korea would never unilaterally refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World's Annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has gained "significant good will steps", such as the cessation of nuclear weapons and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear weapons tests and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean movements about Washington's "stepping" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement left the impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Čenun and Donald Trampa at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader at Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially tried to end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has announced that Phenjan must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not responded to the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The ASV insists that "denoclearisation must be first" and increases the level of pressure created by sanctions to achieve the goal with power, even in opposition to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could force us on our way is empty imaginations that gloat people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not discuss the intentions of the second Kim meeting with Tramp, whose leader in the United Nations had specifically mentioned this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically celebrated three Kim's meetings with South Korea leaders in the last five months of Munu Jae-in and added: "If the other party were South Korea, not the United States, the denouncing of the Korean peninsula would not have gone that way."
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically separated from last year's speech when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the imposition of North Korean rockets on the continental part of the United States was inevitable after the "New President's" Tramps had called Kim on the "roachman" mission of his own singer.
This year, the United Nations Tramps, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Tramps announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "no matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should pay Phenjana for its achievements.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must be energetically continued without errors until final and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions since 2006, in an effort to achieve the financing of the Phenjana nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly, and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not been successful.
He left  Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gagster's respectable requirements".
North Korea's meeting with Munu this month was committed to dismantle the weapon polygon and also the nuclear complex, if the US will do "adequate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed her that "relevant measures", which North Korea wants to see, are security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University will learn a lesson about how to get enough rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has become that students are sleeping more, and it is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes the over-filled study of caffeine for nights.
One speaker found that in the world the best university students are often not even familiar with how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a teaching subject that he considers to be the first subject of this kind of teaching in the United States.
The idea of creating a new subject of learning came to him after he spoke of the effect of sleeplessness on learning.
"A girl came to me and said, 'Why is she telling me this just now that I'm in my last course?'
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he said "Telegraph".
This year’s first feature, presented to students, provides basic information on how good sleep habits promote achievement in education and sport and improve overall well-being.
Pols Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of University Health Services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students suffer from severe sleeplessness during the week.
A series of interactive tasks shall be included in the training process in the hours.
One part is a picture of common doors where students click on coffee bags, curtains, sports boxes and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how performance in sport affects the lack of sleep and how important it is to sleep routine.
In the other part, students are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will affect cigarette smoking," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that a lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep must be the student's "sleep weapon" to combat stress, stress and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, as the lack of sleep locks the brain in the hunger mode, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So (Raimond So), a 19 - year - old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a teaching subject after attending one of the professor’s lectures last year, in Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of education had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive postgraduate education to get a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students install a modulator not only for the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as keep in mind how people suffer from "green lights", which emits electronic devices screens and LED lamps, as they can break daily rhythms, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 "Rangers": Men's gates surround Gerard's viruses
"Rangers" was looking for another sad game in the guests when Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was taken by Steven Gerarda (Steven Gerrard's humming team 1 - 0 for the loss of Livingston.
The "Ibrox" team was hoping to win the first victory since February 4:1 in St. Johnstone's triumph, but the Geria Holt team won Gerard's second loss in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is at 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the bomb doors seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration did not look at anything after trying to balance the result.
"Rangers" set to the sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to the third, and in terms of gate difference it can only be overcome by "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" could be another problem, because the judge's assistant Calum Spence needed medical attention due to a head trauma, which was apparently caused by the next end of the town.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind the "Ayr" back, reaching the "Betfred" bag half-final.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took one point in the previous week, and he would be happy how his well-designed team printed the opponents in each episode.
The Rangers may have managed the bomb more often, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They had to get the gates two minutes after the beginning of Menga’s first game in Scott Pittman’s direction towards Alan McGregor’s (Allan McGregor) gate, but the center player has long spent his great opportunity.
At that time, Captain Craig Halket (Keaghan Jacobs) was released, but his partner, Alan Litgov, was able to launch a bomb just for a long time behind bars.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the last third is expected to be played, not believed it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) no doubt felt that he should have had a sentence in 15 minutes, after he had met Steven Loles (Steven Lawless), but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected a Colombian invitation.
"Rangers" carried out only two sites in the first half, but the former "Ibrox" port guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) did not particularly disturb the Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibally) site with a head, not the placid end of Ovi Edgaria (Ovie Ejaria).
Although "Livingston" started in 34 minutes may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" has not yet ended with Jacob's planned long combination.
Scott Erfilds (Scott Arfield) did not respond when Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) broadcast a bomb to Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson), who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple ending.
Gerards stopped Kulibali replaced Rayin Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, because the semi-guard sent the bomb Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately stopped.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they like, Lithuania and Halket carrying one long chain after another.
The Holta team could have continued the lead in the final phase, but Makgregor played well, supporting Jacobs, before the Lithuanians made a brick with a head from the corner.
"Rangers" replacement Glens Midleton (Glenn Middleton) later requested another sentence, after meeting Jacobs, but Tomson's request was ignored again.
Almanahs: Geigera's inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born by Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed a method for the determination and measurement of radioactivity, as a result, in the end, was a device known as Geiger's numerator.
In science, Geiger's host and retained figure has also taken his place in pop culture, such as in the 1950s, Bells of Coronado, where the main roles were played outside unmistakably by cowboy scientists Rogers and Deils Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It is Geiger's numerator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these ears on, you'll be able to hear how atoms are working because of the radioactivity created by this mineral."
Evans: "Oh, really, it's a bird!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the idea that he called himself “the god of this system of things ” continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
Within the framework of the vaccine therapy, the immune system is taught to recognise bad cells
When using this method, immune system cells that are converted into the laboratory are obtained from the patient
Then they could "see" the protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine has shown many positive results in patients with different types of malignant tumours.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced a loss of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient's immune system cell by converting it into the laboratory to be able to "monitor" several tumours of the protein characteristic HER2 and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) in Betasda (Bethesda), Merilenda Professor J. Berzovskis (Jay Berzofsky) said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of malignant tumours," including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestine cancer, Professor Berzovskis explained.
A similar approach when receiving immunosystem cells that were "learned" from the patient as an attack on the malignant tumour cells has occurred in the case of one type of leukaemia.
Kanje Vests, after visiting SNL, dressed in the MAGA hat, attacked Trampa critics.
It didn't end well
In the course of the study "Saturday Night Live" in Kanje Vests, following an independent chairmanship in which he praised President Donald Tramp and announced that he would run for the President's 2020 election.
He finished his third song last night, which was called "Ghost Town", during which he wore the "Make America Great" hats, he began to bluff the faces of the democracies and again emphasized his support for Trampam.
"There are many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Tramps? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were attracted to racism, you would have abandoned America long ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a sermon with Matt Damon in the main role, in which the Hollywood star challenged Brett Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) in the Senate's Judicial Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's Sexual Attack.
Although this has not been transmitted, the comic book Chris Rock (Chris Rock) loaded material on social networks with Vesta.
It's not clear if Roc tried to get rid of the Vest.
And yet Vest was jealous of the view that he had been ill-treated by his head as a result of his backbone.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out there with their hats on your head!"
They made fun of me!
And they also said that I've lost touch with reality," West said, according to Washington Examiner.
Vests continued: "Do you want to see what happens when a relationship with reality is lost?" and promised to put on "your Supermen's armor," because that means that you can't tell me what to do to me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audience's fluctuations at least twice, but the team members looked samurai, and at least one person told the press: "The studio was in complete silence."
The wedding had recently been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend of the rapist Max Miller.
The wedding was followed by a song (I Love It), which he performed in the champagne bottle suit.
Vesto supported the conservative group leader TPUSA, Kandance Turner, who posted on Twitter: "One of the most powerful people in the world: PATEICOS, WHAT ANOTHER!"
But on Twitter, the director of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West simply "was what he is, and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to hire a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art") who, as I think, supports and beats with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show's repeat on Twitter, he announced that he has changed his name by saying that he has now become "a creature known before as Kanji Vestu".
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the unscrupulous music legend Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then on "the viewer who had previously known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Balihackamore (Ballyhackamore).
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Court of Justice on Monday.

"Tron games" star Kits Herrington turns against toxic manhood
Another Herrington is known as the teeth-driving John Snow HBO's mid-time fantasy series "Tron games".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the brutal hero's stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they have to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thought he had "found the problem", and asked how to end the toxic manhood in #MeToo hour.
Another who recently married his "Tronus Games" partners Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years of age, recognized that this problem is important to him.
"I can't think right now about what mistakes we've made with manhood," he said.
"What do we teach young men in this aspect of the problem when they grow in view of the present problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that make young children feel that they must be considered men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because with young men there are clearly problems."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any "Tron Games" continuation or pre-favor, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "there are obnoxious battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kits will play a key role in the renewed Sema Shepard "True West", which is a story about the film producer and his brother-in-law.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rosa as the best thing that happened to her as a result of the "Tronus Games".
"I met my wife at this show, as it in its own way provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rosa Emmy won the fantasy series The other character John Snow's favorite game.
In June 2018, a couple visited the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health care professionals report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of gender change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost to zero, Chinese health care officials reported at the conference in the province of June.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV as a result of gender is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but LGBT is said to be often seen as discrimination against people.
In view of the national conservative values, it is estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of the measures to address the problem.
Maxina Votersa denies that the employee has leaked the data of the Republican senators, they turn to "dangerous lies" and "consistency theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed the claim that her staff member had published personal information from three U.S. Senators of the Republic of the United States on the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that claims be circulated by the "ultra good" media and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and even more negative lies," Twitter posted on her website.
It is reported that the diluted information includes address and phone numbers belonging to the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Jūta.
Information online appeared Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress during the hearing of the Senate group on the charges of Breta Caveno, appointed by the Supreme Court, in sexual misconduct.
The flood occurred some time after the three senators questioned Caveno.
Conservative, internet sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is related to the Voters office, and revealed information about the Voters staff staff, Hills reported.
"This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Votersa.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of this fraudulent and unfair claim is in no way responsible for the leak of information.
This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Votersa's statement soon led to a criticism online, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is a bitter condemnation," Flesher wrote.
"It leads to the conclusion that her temperament is not consistent with the Congressman.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a soldier.
He must not speak of the accused's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
The task of Fleischera was to compare the Votersa's reaction to the democratic fall of Judge Caveno, who was accused of an excessive reaction during the Thursday hearing.
Omars Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate, who is running to get Votersa to lose his seat in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if it matches the truth," he wrote.
In its communication, Votersa informed that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be recognized as legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John Anglis 3 — Rovana Atkinson’s exhibition on the splendour of films left half-way
It has become easy to search for an association with Brexit in every new movie with a British mirror, and this seems also to apply to this one that has survived, the French edition of Johnny Anglis, which began in 2003 with "John Anglis" and was born in 2011 with "Johny Anglis returns".
Is there a new export option for our nation, as clearly as we are?
In any case, the unqualified Johnny Anglim with the selected eyes and unusually moving face is the right to create a space after the second resurrection — his name is more than any other signal that he is a broad spectrum comic character that has been developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He's, of course, this stupid secret agent, who, despite his strange claims of obscurity, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bin, and a little bit of a guy who plays one song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games in the Chariots of Fire theme.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, unexplained character, which Atkinson once imagined in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements, where he left chaos on his way.
Johnny Angle's latest experience has at least one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter outfit in a medium-time gun suit, and the propeller blades flashing against his skull for a while.
The ability of rekinson to produce a visual commissive impression is well visible, but humor is a rather weak and strange surface, especially because "serious" cinema brands such as "007" and "Invincible mission" itself with confidence use the comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor makes it seem that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny Angle's absurd remains are not as creative and targeted as Atkinson's fair film tricks in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has become a serious cheese market.
Cyberhacker has entered the British super-blind Internet network, revealing the identity of British agents in all these areas, as an unhappy active agent — a regrettable role for little Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last peace for the Prime Minister, the Pompoise and the man who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing what he can, with Teresa Mejai, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
In the field of research, her advisors are informed that since all the active pressures have been revealed, she will have to call on someone who has retired.
And this man is the unmistakable Jonis Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and he teaches us how to work as a secret agent (a couple of sensitive jocie) because Anglis offers to learn the art of art from the very foundations.
The English is delivered back to the extraordinary meeting of Vithol and is combined with his former many suffering assistant Bo, who is also playing Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
Because now a man is being hired, hired by a submarine commander, a sensitive character that becomes important only at the end of the movie, a role that Vicki Pepperdaina (Vicki Pepperdine) has not been fully used.
And so Batman, with Robin's huge mistake in serving her in the secret service, has returned and met the beautiful late wife of Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) of Ophelius Lodi (Ophelia Bulletin).
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has a dangerously rented charismatic technology billionaire, the wicked Jason Volt, whose image is Jack Lewis (Jake Lacy), and he claims to be able to solve the British computer chain.
Anglis and Bo start their seductive sensibilities: dressed as officers, they burn a fine French restaurant; they create a secret connection to entering the Volta luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual reality on the head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
Everything is done at the end, but to the extent that the film is attractive and the tape has a lot of children's television elements.
A lot of measured elements.
Like the other Johnny Angle films, I can't imagine if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan a role that would fully use his talent?
The Leborist Party rejects plans that British will work four days a week, but will receive pay in five days
Jeremy Corbina (Jeremy Corbyn) The Leiborist party is preparing to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the company's leaders to grant workers, with the help of the artificial intelligence revolution, one more holiday.
In such a case, employees will be able to enjoy the last three days of the week, while at the same time receiving the same salary as before.
Avoti tells us that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for those who work well.
The transition to four working weeks has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it to be an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the highest-ranking representatives of the Leiborist Party reported "The Sunday Times": "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen one day, but the four-day work week is an idea that meets the goal of the party to balance the economy for the good of the workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party in the industry."
The Lebanese Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party has already promised to implement the 2017 general election campaign for four days.
However, these hungers are not supported by the Leiborist Party as they are now.
The representative of the Leiborist Party reported: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Eine Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Leiborist Conference last week to give his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Makdonela explained that he has committed himself to withdrawing the power of "directors for mass" and "speculators" for public services.
The Minister of the Eine Cabinet plans to also mean that the existing average shareholders of the water companies will not be able to recover all their packages, as the Lebanese government could be implemented due to the injustices permitted by the "debt".
He also approved plans to include companies working in the governments and establish exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector companies to employees who receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy answer "60 minutes", or the FBI investigation into the Kaveno case could change their views
The FBI's investigation against Judge Brett Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises a question as to whether the findings of the office could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute news correspondent, Scott Pelley, questioned the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find something that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy left a more obvious impression on the person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, in the course of the hearing procedure, that I spoke to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was committed, direct and unmistakable."
However, the vote by Grema is obviously put into the stone.
"I have made a decision on Brett Caveno, and it will require a deplorable charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brets strongly rejected it," said Grems, referring to Christian Blasey Ford.
"And none of her nominated was able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be a World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and a similar impressive mission: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will meet in the Great Wall of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances, such as Janet Jacksons, Revers Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the International Defence Group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this measure (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call or other important action to promote awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which has remained for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding with free concerts a good way to convince people to act, or just another "clickivism" case when people think they really are able to influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "work" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various objectives.
It informs that these activities have helped world leaders to report on commitments and policies equivalent to over US$ 37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and implementing partners established in the United Kingdom who committed themselves to "helping children to grow fully", promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to help end the country's inadequate maintenance after more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the Government of the United Kingdom, the donor, the government of other countries, and the citizens of the world as you support, we can leave a waste of food in the history of social injustices," he announced in London's April 2018 concert "The Power of Nutrition" by Treisija Ulmena (Tracey Ullman).
The group also mentioned that, after more than 5000 measures were launched, when the UK Government called for better food for mothers and children, the government announced the allocation of funding to the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website— "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long journey, in which we will soon be covered and suffer failure.
However, just as major civil rights and anti-partiety movements have done so before us, so we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae (Janelle Monae) are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use war fleets to "block" to delay Russian energy exports — Minister for Home Affairs
"If necessary" Washington can use its war fleet to delay Russia's energy market, including in the Middle East, – said US Interior Minister Rains Zinke (Ryan Zinke), as quoted as "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in places where it operates under the legitimate government invitation, are well within the scope of the study of new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the measure undertaken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to resolving the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually the same.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuels.
More recently, the Trampa administration is promoting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia with a much cheaper choice for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trampa's administration officials and also President Donald Tramps himself are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriated" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project that would make Berlin "dependent" from Moscow by the words of Trampa.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11 billion US dollars worth of North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which doubles the existing gas power to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlis believes that the Washington project is simply based on economic reasons and is an unfair example of competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose the supplier," Aleksandr Novaks, after a meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy Riku Perij, said after September.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if a third country were to interfere with our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, director of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Dieters Kemps.
Senator Elizabeth Voren will seriously consider his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Voren announced on Saturday that he was serious about running for the presidency post after mid-term elections.
During the House's meeting in Holio, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he considered running the President's will.
"And it's time for you to have women in Washington who "save" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy with the will of the President of the United States."
During the House's meeting, Vorena referred to President Donald Tramp, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply disturbed by what Donald Tramps is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Tramp and the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bret Kaveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Vorena said, "Of course, before the elections, there is a need for an FBI investigation."
However, the survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Varena's supporters do not believe that she should run the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe political research centre/research, fifteen percent of the "possible" Masachuset voters claimed that the senator should not apply for the election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results revealed that more support had been granted by former Governor Devals Patricks, receiving 38 percent of the candidate's election and 48 percent against.
The name of the Democratic Party's function as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Senator Vermont Sanders is also reflected in the 2020 election.
The news agency Associated Press reported that Baidens is committed to making an official decision by January.
Sara Pelina quotes Treka Pelina PTSS Donald Trampa in the village
Treks Peillin (26) spent a year in Iraq following the invasion of the railway station in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after his return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSS and some of the dose vulnerabilities that our soldiers return to," she told the audience in the city of Donald Tramp in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pelina called his arrest "a visible problem that everyone seems invisible" and told his son and other war veterans that "they will return a little differently, they will return hard, they will return wondering whether they are being respected by their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military field have given to this country".
According to the representative of the Vasil Police Department, Den Benet was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against women and the possession of weapons while in a state of violence.
18 states, Colombia area met a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian area support a legal challenge to a new US policy that prevents victims of asylum fleeing from the gang or violence in the family.
The representatives of the 18 states and the Colombian area in Washington presented a brief statement to the court council on Friday to support the asylum seeker who will face the obstacles created by that policy, "NBC News".
The full name of the petitioner Grace v. Sessions in the trial, which the American Citizens' Freedom Union launched in August against federal politics, has not been opened.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of his violent gang member" abused her, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers, who supported Greece, described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of US asylum seekers, such as the countries where the problem is widespread have gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing the family of violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, Attorney General Karl Racin announced that the new policy "Ignorates national, federal and international laws that have been introduced by decads".
"The federal law provides that all requests for asylum are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim concerned, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the Court's brief statement said.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are damaging the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Seshons (Jeff Sessions) appealed to immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled the family of violence and gang abuse.
"The assistance is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of their race, religion, nation, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Seshons said in his Communication on Policy on 11 June.
The approach has never been designed to address all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Expensive rescue efforts by the number of people who have fallen into the search process
The situation became increasingly difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, calming her fragrant baby in the city's evacuation centre of Palu.
"For minutes, the rapid medical assistance service introduces new victims.
Clear water is defective."
The inhabitants were visible by returning to their ruined homes and by crossing the wasteland, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which had suffered from an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had a vertebral column and a back, slept outside the Pale Army hospital, where patients were cared for outside because of the incredibly powerful postpartum.
She had tears in her eyes, recalling how a powerful earthquake began to rock the fifth floor of the hotel, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
It seems I was printed in wall holes," the news agency "Associated Press" said to Harris, noting that his family had arrived for marriage in the city.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of attempts to promote advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came forward with a four-page long advertisement, highlighting the benefits of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Tramps referred to the annex paid to China Day in the state of Aiova's most sold newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to interfere with the U.S. Congress's election on 6 November, but China rejects it.
Trampa’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election marked what US officials told the news agency Reuters, that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to press China.
While there is a perfectly normal situation that foreign governments are putting up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasing trade war, as a result of which they apply a series of tariffs to each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed at exporters in states like Aiov, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terijs Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor of the long-term in Aiov, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on the Sunday edition of "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this promotion by putting propaganda advertisements into our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses for its own good the so-called freedom of speech and free press tradition, inserting paid advertisements "Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find a limited number of different views in the Beijing newshouse and do not see the true reflection of such different views that can be related to the disturbing economic path of China's citizens, given that the media is here under the firm supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers had avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans welcoming women's voters from mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the expected mid-term elections, they will experience a negative reaction, especially on the part of women.
Related emotions have been extremely high, and most Republicans are already ready to give their votes.
These things cannot be undone, "for this Saturday's article "The Hill" was announced by Professor of Science at the University of the University of Siracusa, Maxwell School of Political Science, Grant Reeher.
Ríhers questioned that the last moment's encouragement of Senator Jeff Fleik (Jeff Flake) (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be a pretty big reason to calm the angry voters.
"The villages will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," according to the newspaper Washington, D.C. on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser of the progressive movement "MoveOn" and the national representative.
On Friday morning, protestors in front of the Senate sang protestally "Novembris comes!" when the Republicans in charge of the Court Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno for the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," the independent political analyst St. Rotenberg (St. Rothenberg) told the news portal.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the people living in the urbanised, flexible voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29 years) who often do not go to the elections even if the President does not like them."
Even before the Forda's public testimony, in which she stated allegations of sexual violence on the part of the Supreme Court candidate, analysts would have failed if the Republics continued to apply for this candidacy.
"The party of those Republicans has become a funny mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of Republicans at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be tried, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priority USA, who is the leader of this group, helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided with regard to those who believe in Forda and Kaveno's testimonies, a little more attempting to believe the latter.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents have a definite or most likely tendency to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 per cent claim that they are definitely or most likely inclined to believe in Caven's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have lied about his testimony until only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleika’s encouragement, the FIB is currently carrying out investigations into Forda’s claims and at least one more complainant — Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda pointed out to the Senate's Judicial Committee that at the age of 17, Kaveno had been drinking against their sexual assault.
Ramirez claims that during his studies in Jeil in 1980, a candidate for the Supreme Court’s office showed her his genitals.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tims Kinders-Lie (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web designer, launches a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open-source platform "Solid".
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Childrenss-Li joked that the secret intention of "Inrupt" is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The use of "Solid" technology is used to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available simultaneously in one browser.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines what and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers through data".
According to the company manager John Bruce, the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make "Solid" available to everyone.
The company is currently operating with Childrenss-Li, Bruce, IBM-acquired security platform, some external developers dedicated to the project, and a voluntary community of encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the "Inrupt" website.
Kinderss-Li said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes during one night completely turning all their business models.
"We don't ask for his permission."
On Saturday in the newspaper Childrens-Li, "Inrupt" stated that "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web-based "Solid".
In 1994, Childrenss-Li transformed the Internet, creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Childrensam-Li has had an influential view in the discussions on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the launch of "Inrupt" Childrenss-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am truly optimistic about this new web watch," Childerss-Li quoted.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian cross assigned to the emperor during World War I
For 100 years now, in that native city, the event is marked when the only preacher of the Church of England has received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Col. Bernards Vens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
On Saturday’s exhibition in Rashden, Northamptonshire, she discovered two small pieces of a monument stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "scattered symbolically", that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant reward.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vens led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very frequent mist and large-scale fire and lightning.
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and with the utmost certainty led this line forward before the admission of the large-scale zone, where three groups were established.
On October 4, 1918, German sniper, Colonel Venus, was killed — just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his grandfather's action was "killing what I could never do, and that at the same time is also very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also had a debt in the patronage of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens said that he felt "deserved by participating in this debt", and noted that "the value of the hero shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night "Bellator 206", but instead waited for the Pig Pepu
Imagine that you spent the whole night watching Bellator 206, but at the end of this main event you are denied this view.
In Sanhos, there were 13 matches in the exhibition, including six main maps, which were broadcast online all night long in the United Kingdom Channel 5.
At 6.00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi (Ggard Mouusasi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were about to face each other, the audiences in the United Kingdom were surprised by the sudden change of transmission to the Pepus.
Some were not really aware of the time when the whole night until early dawn had left behind while waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the transmission change to a child's multifilm as "successful joke".
"The government has determined that the content of this kind is not acceptable after 6 a.m., so the transfer to the children's programme took place," explained Devs Schwartz (Dave Schwartz), Bellator's oldest vice president on marketing and communication issues.
"Pepa's house," "yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Kokers, said he would work on schedule planning so that visitors in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"When I think of the retransmission, I think we can sort it out," Kokers said.
"But the clock is there six from morning to Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the transmission was switched, and they weren't positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But that wasn't it, the government controlled it.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem next time.
We will hold on to five fights, not six (as it has been so far), but we will try to please fans, but we will stop.
It is a failure."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Daily doesn't feel good enough for her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic kidney, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
24 years old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started attending high school.
During his first radio 4 "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give others a "voice".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term program, has been in pain for several months.
As exemplified by Laverne's first programme, Daily said that as he grew up, he felt "lesser" than others, because "the society is not supposed to like both girls and boys".
He said, "Even today, he feels that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me strength and stamina to achieve success."
He said that he wanted to prove that there was "killing something" to keep people from hoping when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of the Olympic Bronze Medal has become a high-level leader of the LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in this year's Consistency Games in Australia, calling for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk to the public because he felt happy that he could live openly and without difficulty, and wanted to give a "promotion" to others.
The three-time World Championships said that love for a man in the US filmmaker at Dustin Lans in Black (Dustin Lance Black), whom he met in 2013, was "surprisingly unprepared".
Daily was married to an older Oscar award winner last year, and he claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a small age" (his first Olympic games were at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar uppers and falls.
The couple became the eldest son of Roberts Reys Blakes-Deilis (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Deilis claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"For the first year everything that was important to me was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Roby."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he was asking for was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daily took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering the home in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Heather Small, performed "Proud", which reasoned with him on his way to achievements in the Olympics and still consume the zozade.
The program "Desert Island Discs" will be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. after the British summer.
On the reserve floor of Mikelson's form, on Saturday's Raider's cup of tea
American Son Mikkelson (Phil Mikkelson) will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ridera Cup game game, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a successful turnout.
Mikelson, who has already attended the two-year-old championship every 12 years, was seated on the reserve floor for four ball games and two pairs of games.
Instead of being at the centre of action as often as it has been in connection with the US Commands, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and by participating in his game with the hope of correcting what he is hired.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even on the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the forced struggle "Le Golf National" in the uneven field where unprecise stones are regularly punished.
And, if the game itself isn't scary enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Michelson will fight with the British-based champion Frankesko Molinari (Francesco Molinari), who has joined forces with the latest Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who are left with four points at the start of 12 single-players succeed in driving, Mikelson’s match could be of decisive importance.
Furik expressed his confidence in his teammate.
"He fully knew his role today, spread me behind, applied his hand to me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furiks said.
"He is very confident about himself.
He's a great sportsman who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I imagined him playing two cats.
I imagined more, but everything went wrong the way we did, and that's what we're going to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will give Nika Faldo (Nick Faldo) a record in connection with the most played matches in the Raidera Cup fight on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Rayder Cup race career, which has never really fallen to the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has won 18 winnings, has suffered 20 losses and seven undisclosed games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team a certain benefit of a non-material character.
"He's sensitive, sarcastic and clear, he likes to be concerned about people, and he's a great team member," he explained.
"I think the youngest players also liked to hug him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just games."
European election captain Thomas Bjørn (Thomas Bjørn) knows that a considerable drive can be taken off quickly
European election captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a major step forward in the management of the battle for the last day's Rider Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant situation.
Dani won five points over the Americans in 1997 in Valderram, where the team of opponents, the captain of the Swiss Ballesteros (Swe Ballesters) won the top five points over the Americans, but only now went on the finish line with a very small score, namely winning with 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"You kept reminding yourself that we had been very prominent in the management of Valderram; we had been in the management of Brooklyn, where we had lost, and Valderram, where we had won, but only with a small advantage," said Bjorns (in the picture), looking at the victory of the 2018 release group with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, in the leadership of the 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus history will show to me and to every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you'll give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophy and focus on it.
I have always said that I have focused on 12 players on our side, but we are very well aware of who is facing us on the other side, the world's greatest players."
As soon as the performance was shown by his players in the golf course, Bjorn said, "I never rejoiced for the agro.
Tomorrow's new challenges are ahead.
To-morrow individual games are scheduled, and it is quite another thing.
It's great if in moments when everything goes well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully checked.
This message should give you to your players, that is, that they will give all of themselves in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he should also be able to show his best performance."
Unlike the Bjorn opponents, Captain Jims Furiks will watch his players show their best performance in individual games rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spyts (Jordan Speeth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who won three points from four.
Fariks himself has been on both sides of these significant last-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a result of the European team's success in the event of a sensational success, which is later known as the 'Miracle at Medina' in the golf world.
"Atceros every sentence," he said in response to how Bens Crenshaw, Commander of the 1999 team, joined his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get to the fast show that you had in Brooklyn, which you had in Medina.
When such a impulse is broadcast in one direction, it creates great pressure on mid-term games.
We created our composition and we worked together in the way we thought it was right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Tomas had been given the task of trying to drive the attack, and he wrote in the first part the main game by Rory McIlroy and the Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramu, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"I'm a team of guys in this order, because I think it's best in the course of the tournament," Bjorn said about the selected players.
Retirement of Germany's new flagship into operation
Germany's most recent fleet had to be transferred to operation in 2014, thus replacing the old Cold War War War warships, but it will not happen at least until next year because of the system of errors and rising costs, it reported the local media.
The transfer of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" to the Bädenes-Viertemberg class is now suspended until the first half of 2019, as reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, quoting military representatives.
The ship was to be joined by the Carafloit in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems had an impact on the fate of the extensive project.
Four vessels of the Budenes-Viertemberg class, ordered by the Caraflote in 2007 to replace the old Bremen class frgates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it must be possible to place new frgates up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, continuous delay means that the latest technological forces that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries will have already been old by the time it comes into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
A failed cargo F125 last year was considered in all the headlines when the German fleet officially refused to ship in operation and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time after the ship's delivery the car fleet returned to the ship's building.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render warships inappropriate if it were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor as the vessels of the Bådenes-Virtemberg class are operating around 120 large crews, which are only half of the older Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to make its improvements in the future.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes heavy ship Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the wrong apparatus, all the costs of the project (including crew training) have also become a major problem.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion in the original target of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new freight are becoming particularly important, given the recent warnings that the German forces will be reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartel (Hans-Peter Bartels), the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Carafloat was indeed "starting to miss the ship to be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly complicated, since old ships are being removed from operation but are not being delivered in place.
He regretted that none of the Budenes-Virtemberg class frigates joined the Caraflote.
"National Trust" Listens to the Life of the Hidden Frogs
The new study carried out in some property of the Scottish Highland is aimed at discovering how the spiders in the food search process use the screen.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help them in future protection measures.
Scottish scientists "National Trust" in Inveveves gardens in Vesteros will explore punuris, pigmeiscis, as well as brown peacocks and water puppies.
Special recorders will be placed in the main premises, which will track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of the bellows and of the species carrying out the specific activities.
A biotope map and a report will then be developed to establish a detailed scene showing the conduct of the sparrows.
NTS Nature Protection Adviser Robs Dewar (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of biotopes management such as the establishment of floors and the best conservation of forests for rabbits and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has collapsed significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the loss of the shelters and the habitat.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Actually, no eyelashes.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes during hunting.
They use a complex method of determining a place of refuge to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land maintenance throughout the country, is very serious about the problem of bats.
The organisation has 10 trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspection of hatches and sometimes even rescue works.
The organisation has even set up the first and only special reserve "Threave" for chickens in Scotland in Damfres and Galve, where eight of the species of chickens found in Scotland will be washed.
The property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suitable for eyelashes.
"This is a great place for spiders," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about spiders, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand what they need for survival."
He emphasises that it is important to check whether there will be no shackles in the place concerned, as it may happen that as a result of the unidentified destruction of one mother’s hideout, up to 400 mothers and their grandchildren are killed, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
Pets are protected and must not be killed, drowned, disturbed or destroyed.
The Scottish Sixpence Protection Fund (Bat Conservation Trust) has invited Elizabeth Ferela (Elisabeth Ferrell) to help the company.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about spiders, and we just don't know how they look."
Ronaldo rejects the prosecution by ordering lawyers to sue the German Journal in court
Christian Ronald (Cristiano Ronaldo) has condemned their accusations as "false news", saying that people "want to pay attention" by using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to appeal to the court of the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these claims.
The Portuguese origins and the Turina Juventus football star are accused of winning American Kathryn Majorg (Katharyn Mayorg) in a Lasvegås hotel number in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep her silent about this incident, so on Friday he announced "Der Spiegel".
A few hours after this statement, Ronald 33, with Instagram online video addressed his 142 million followers, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they were saying today is false news," the payer of the balloon d'Or told the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything is good," added the player.
According to the information provided by "Reuters", Ronald's lawyers are preparing to appeal to the court's journal "Der Spiegel" about the claims they have made about "unacceptable reporting on suspicion in the area of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the breach which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel room "Palms Hotel and Casino" in the "Suite" class room in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted by the Nevada State District Court, Ronald and Majorg went back to the player's hotel number, where he had won a woman.
Majorga claims that after that incident Ronaldo's critique was on his way and said that you were "by 99 percent "good boy", but a critique in this "one percent" critique.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had had sex, but that had happened after mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had been taken to the hospital for injuries, but later she agreed to an overseas settlement because she felt "fears of activity" and worried about "public degradation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wishes to accept the terms of this agreement, since that incident left a lasting trauma.
At the time of these claims, Ronald went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros went to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexits: The United Kingdom "for all time regrettably" loss of autoproducers
"The United Kingdom "will regret it at all times", if after Brexit it loses its world leadership position in the production of cars," said Business Secretary Greg Clarks.
Their concern is that Toyota UK has notified BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production near the existing factory in Burnston in Dribia.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese autoproducer said that delaying borders in the case of Brexit could lead to a job without an agreement.
Last year, the Toyota factory, which produces models "Auris" and "Avensis", produced nearly 150 000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our plant will be stopped," said Toyota Managing Director at Burnston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been disappointed by the withdrawal from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit a month, he will close his mini factory in Oxford.
As car manufacturers claim, the main concerns are the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates according to the "spray time" principle, where the cars produced by the order are available every 37 minutes from both the UK and EU suppliers.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement, there could be obstacles at the border that could create some delays and gaps.
According to Toyota, it would not be possible to retain more than one day's worth of inventory in its Dührer factory, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clarka said that the "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU developed by Teresa Mejas (Theresa May) is "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that allows, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present time, but also to use this opportunity," he said in Radio 4 "Today".
"Concerning it not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to fully continue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota’s failure to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term rising costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works as the Union's merger coordinator, said that his members feel more and more concerned: "I can say from experience that as soon as a job is lost, it will not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be held again, report to the White House
Donald Trampa's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "remained for another week", as the fight with Bret Kaveno, the Supreme Court judge's candidate continued, so the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the involvement of Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the involvement of Russia's will, the link between the funds used by Trampa and Russia, and the possible disregard of the rule of law on the part of the President.
For months, Washington has been concerned about whether Tramps will abandon the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of the negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of leaving the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein is missing this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where he spoke about his resignation.
Instead, it was announced a Thursday meeting with Tramp, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" would not be allowed to leave Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a dispute with the Senate's judicial committee, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused them of committing their sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristíne Blezia Forda.
On Friday, Tramps led the FIB to conduct a weekly investigation in connection with Kaveno's complaints, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
Rozenstein said, "The date of arrival has not yet been set, it could be this week or a week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sandersa has not acted in the White House press briefing since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of letters is not linked to the disloyalty of television reporters "of glory", although she added, "The fact that they are of glory."
She then proposed direct contact between Tramp, resulting in an increased interest in the press.
"The President took part in more questions and responses sessions than any president before him," she said, and, without giving any more information, said, "We are interested in their number."
Sandersa claimed that the letters would always happen, but, "if the press will be able to ask the President of the United States questions without interfering, it is absolutely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and you see that we've done a lot of it in the last few weeks, and it will take place in the press briefings where you can talk to the President of the United States."
The tramp regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences visited by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President demonstrated his reason this week in New York, with the rapporteur's uncontrollable and sometimes strange remarks.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff in Scotland NHS about fears associated with Breksit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and support for Brexit.
Gina Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fremena wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during spring on the withdrawal which led to the decisions to be reached this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again how much I have appreciated the involvement of each employee regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care service and benefit our caring patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
An emergency operation is being performed after a head trauma to Kristen Abercrombie
In the state of Tenesí, "Tigers" protected Kristěn Abercrombie (Christian Abercrombie) was carried out an extraordinary operation after a head trauma that he received in the Saturday game, which resulted in the "Vanderbilt Commodores" in 31-27, reported sports reporter "Tennesean" Mike Organs (Mike Organ).
The chief coach of the state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was suffered not long before half-time.
"He came to the side line and so said he collapsed," said Ridd.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave him oxygen, then put it on the bench and delivered it to further investigation.
One of the state officials in Tennessee told Nashvila, a reporter of WSMV, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that in the meantime, "no information about the type of trauma/hardness", and the state team in Tennessee is trying to understand when this trauma is being found.
Abercrombie, a Red Crescent representative, is in his first season after Illionis was replaced by a state team in Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had performed in general five blocks, which in general constituted 18 in this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory Plan.
This step will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased national fee will be applicable to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash register provides that up to 120 million stamps can be collected per year to be sent to the homeless.
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and by sending the additional aid to the homeless, which will be announced today by Teresa Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide accommodation at the most affordable prices and to talk about the more sustainable part of the society.
The increased national tax will be applied to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money they receive, to allow government efforts to tackle the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level of charge two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another place for rent, could be as much as three percent.
The national cash register provides that such a step may be supplemented by its budget up to up to 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property of London is purchased by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many of the country's territories, especially in the capital, have become "spok cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers, most of which spend their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the national tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land but not using it, and encouraged Mrs Mejas to withdraw from the quotas for affordable housing in order to address the issue of British housing.
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of attractive house reform, including a reform on rent control and out of the house for no reason.
He also wants to give the council greater powers for the construction of new homes.
Ms Mejas said: "I mentioned last year that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream, that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means the organisation of the housing market in our proposed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and organize their lives.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought as easily as foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as residents of the United Kingdom.
Many dreams about their home have become too far away, and the problem of homeless people is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My greatest goal is to run Scotland."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, claims that his biggest goal is to be a Scottish leader at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now taking third place in the first league with three points from above.
This evening he went to the Stadium of Light after the introduction of St Mirren back in Scotland's premier season.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B box, and that's all," said Ross for the Scottish BBC broadcast.
"But I grew up, along with my father looking at Scotland games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in running a club."
In charge of the Sunderland Club, the Rose advocate is Dick Advocate, David Moijes, Sam Alardys, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Guss Poyet and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former president of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not felt any dismay following so much of the club's recognized leaders, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnslijas and Ipsvicz.
"My achievements will now be evaluated as to whether I will be able to return to this club as a premier.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it certainly fits in with the premier," he said.
"The return of the club will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will be successful here only when this task is accomplished."
Ross is only in his third year in his career, acting as Deputy Director in Dumbarton for some time and spending a 15-month period of "Hearts" training.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from falling to third level and in the same season he helped St Mirren get the champion title.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable at the moment than in his career at the clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These may have been real cruises," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa."
"I really believed that management was my true call – much more appropriate than playing.
I was disappointed because I had made good progress, and I was able to live and enjoy some of the heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. Looks like I'm in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday 30 September from 12.00 to 13.00 after the British summer time.
The report reveals that the most appropriate time for the enjoyment of the pins is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has left Britain with less popular traffic, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data revealed that in July the sales of cows and sheep had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Mārtins (Peter Martin), who represents the CGA Agency for Business Consultations, which collected data, said: "The constant slowdown and participation in the World Cup campaign in England meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e., the crook profit had increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurant had fallen.
Restaurants with a fall of 1.8 per cent in June experienced a worse situation in July.
The situation in the cups and bars was the most rewarding because they experienced a lot more uphill than the restaurants experienced downhill.
Food-based tires are also hard from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers felt it.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In cows and bar drinks, monthly consumption increased by 6.6 per cent, while food consumption decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Pols Neuman said: "These results continue the trend at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sports measures are major factors that determine turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent compared to the period in question last year will be particularly painful for the additional unfavourable cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers in the long and hot summer, it was not possible to arrive at the most inappropriate time, and the time will indicate whether a more moderate temperature, normally experienced in August, will provide such a much needed space."
The total increase in sales between cattle and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in sales volume of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the sales monitor of the United Kingdom's square, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes the data of 47 groups of activities where the total turnover exceeds 9 billion sterlings, and this is the industry's criterion.
Every fifth child has a hidden social media account that it hides from their parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, is a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers.
In an area where 20,000 high school students participated, a false increase in Instagram pages was discovered.
This information raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years of age, forms social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In an area where 20,000 high school students participated, Instagram found that the number of false profiles in the photo collection site was increasing rapidly.
This information raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students mentioned that they had a "clean principal" account to show their parents, as well as private accounts.
A mother who was exposed to her 13 - year - old daughter’s hiding place discovered a teenager who encouraged others to take her out.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Leaders Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them recognized that they kept private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilida Doila will be a "lightly-tuned voice" in the Scottish Government
At the annual meeting of the Management Board of Elidh Doyle, the Management Board of Scotland was elected as Director without executive rights.
Doila is Scotland's most rewarding space and outdoor light, and President Ian Beitij (Ian Beattie) described this step as a great opportunity for those who have been driven by sport to use her extensive experience at international level for the last ten years.
"Eilida is highly respected throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world in the light-flowing community, and we are confident that the Scottish light-flows will get tremendously much, involving them in the government," Bithynia said.
Doila said: "I would like to act as a "soft voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this type of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Olympic Games, thus totaling four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC bandit, is unable to go after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago, I experienced stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I was fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I am able to do business training!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Instructions for breast milk pump advertising comparing mothers with cows
The breast milk pump production company has taken care of shared views online in relation to the advertising where feeding mothers are compared with feeding cattle.
In order to note the so-called "first silent breast pump" in circulation, the consumer technology company "Elvie" launches a clever prayer advertisement to demonstrate the freedom of breast feeding mothers to provide the new pump.
Four real mothers dance with a wall-filled cow in a song whose words look like, "Yes, I cry myself, but you don't see any eyes" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not twins, they're my breasts."
It goes on: "Send out, send out, I'll feed the little ones, send out, send out, I'll kiss my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a wide online resonance.
77,000 times the seen and hundreds of times the video has received partial feedback from the viewers, and many claim that it brings out the light milk industry's "smooths".
"It is a very wrong decision to use beef for the advertising of the product.
Just like us, they, to produce milk, have to become difficult and have to give birth, but their babies are taken away a few days after their birth," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump without written inclusion in breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The view was also expressed: "The advertising makers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the advertisement, and a woman admitted that she felt that the song was "exciting".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a joke, but I understand its idea.
This is a generic product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It is a sensitive advertising, thought for mothers who shed milk (not in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like "gooses".
It is not a advertising which celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all sang with unwritten pumps placed in their breasts.
The campaign’s concept is based on the observation that many women who shed milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely silent, it does not have a pipe and a pipe, and it does not necessarily include breast-feeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep small and even participate in activities outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Anna Balarin) partner "Mother" and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a brave and provocative placing on the market.
By drawing parallels between the women who shed milk and the cows, we wanted to pay attention to the withdrawal of milk, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the sense of the depressing freedom that will bring the new pump."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has come to the center of attention.
In London’s fashion week, two children’s mothers appeared on the milk of Marta Jakobovska (Marta Jakobowski) when using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly relocated to a land-based city at the Texas border
The number of children of detained migrants has grown rapidly, although the borders of each month cross relatively the same number of people as before, and have partially achieved it in the framework of the trampa administration's review of rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Usually most of the sponsors have also been immigrants themselves without documents, fearing that, openly applying to take the child, it would endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to allow fingerprints to be removed and this data would also be transferred to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz (Matthew Albence), senior officer of immigration and customs law enforcement, before the congress, indicated that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors to unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are illegally staying here, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
We therefore continue to follow such persons," Mr Albensa said.
According to asylum-seekers, in an effort to examine children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules which provide that some of them will have to be brought to court within a month of detention than after 60 days, as the previous standard laid down.
Many will be able to use the videoconferencing call rather than personally to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for exemption will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the greater the possibility that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or refugee attempts, has been reported in accordance with the information and evidence provided by asylum workers that has been obtained from the system over the last few months.
The lawyers claimed that these concerns will be increased in major objects such as Tornillo, where signs of the child suffering are more often ignored because of their width.
They added that moving children to a large city without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to withdraw from their friends could create traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the United States, France and Turkey 'occupiers' immediately to carry out their forces
At the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Moualem (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been raging for the eighth year.
Moulems, who also performs the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria in defence of the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualems argued that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes since 2011, "the fight against terrorism has almost ended".
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", purified from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed in Syria about 2,000 soldiers, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, who are enemies of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this state of war.
As for the issue of refugees, Mualems stated that the conditions were great for them to return, and he blamed "the individual Western countries" for "the distribution of irrational fears", which is why the refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international communities and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance to rebuild the country before an agreement on the end of the war between Asadu and the opposition is reached.
The UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zones based in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented Russian-supported Syrian forces from attacking the province in a large extent, where three million people live.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is a definite deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jhabat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy, Stefan de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura), is looking forward to convening the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, the first meetings to draw up the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and to pave the way for elections.
Moualems laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to the "review of the existing Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Tramps will be selected for a second time
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be postponed by the 2020 election, unless, and possibly, many liberal observers, impeachments and scandals will not put an early mark on his presidency.
And in that case, "it will always be the most dramatic final of the presidency!"
At present, there is nothing to show about the relief of observers.
Since 2014, the rating has been more than doubled in the CNN’s most advantageous broadcast time, reaching 1.05 million viewers, but the MSNBC has almost tripled by reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is looking at 2.4 million viewers in the best radio time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, the company Nielsen informs, however, MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reicela Medova's show) is at the top of the cable TV ranking with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"It is a fire that attracts many people, because it is an incomprehensible matter for us," explained Neil Bajers (Neal Baer), the founder of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama tells about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by Capitol.
Nellai Skovelai (Nell Scovell), comedy writer-veteranai and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is its theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that I would vote for Mr. Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he smiles at me,' said the young man of Skovela.
Haos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v. Veid case, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the global economic situation.
Ignoring is a horror that can only be allowed by the most privileged observers.
And yet this is more than to be informed to a citizen when at six o'clock you will see expert groups discussing how Bob Woodward has used uncalled sources of information for his book Fair, Pola Manafort, $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from sharp colors and skin ("the cloth from which the high-sensitivity is drawn," said Washington Post) and what will be the role of Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) to the sad Tramp, so to speak, anatomical detail description.
I, for example, will never push Super Mario like I used to.
"Part of what he does that creates the impression of reality shows is that every day, he wrapped you with information," Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the "Pawn Stars" explained about Trampa's changing team and daily performances (crowding with N.F.L., Kim Chenuna).
You can't let yourself run a long one of the episodes, because otherwise you'll be left.
When I arrived to Mr. Fleiss (Fleiss), the time for the North Coast (Kauai) was 80 degrees (~27 by Celsia), but he sat in the rooms where, without leaving an eye glance, he looked at the MSNBC broadcast while entering the CNN.
He was unable to find out, not when Brett Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) had to stand before the Senate Judicial Committee and his future in the Supreme Court was threatened.
"I remember the times when we created all those crazy shows and when people said that "this is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I think it's a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from outside to pre-election campaigns of the most advanced mid-term parliament
No wonder that the 17th Congressional Election Area seeks money through the transformation of Congress areas, which will result in the two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently converted Pittsburgh nomadic area is linked to a Democratic Representative of Connor Lembo (Conor Lamb), who acquired his place in another region in the spring of last year's special election.
Lembs will fight with another existing member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th part of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered with the new 17th part.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of the Republics, the cards were recast.
Competition in the new 17th area has led to the fight between the party's main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won a small victory in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania in March.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tramps won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a little overdue for democratics.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but then thought about it.
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trampa had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel (Juan Carlos Varela), and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners left behind the Trampa organisation management team.
The official of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "the recent decision no longer to recognise Taiwan", his department representative Hüter Nauerte (Heather Nauert) indicated in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered to apply only to Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million large amounts from America, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and limiting targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country where the amount of unemployment and death has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, with a focus on security and economic well-being, followed by a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the country's top officials clearly said that they wanted the conference to be held, essentially by ending their views on the punishment of Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pens (Mica Pence) has now decided to attend a conference scheduled in mid-October to show how serious the administration is highlighting the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences on the part of Washington.
The representative of the White House, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debate, which was characterized by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in the internal negotiations if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories were confirmed by a close external analyst to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
History study
The second stone garden could contain a report by the Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr. Trampa may have lost the justice that the public has very much evidence.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party gets the upper hand in Congress, Trampam will come to respond to this structure and possibly also to his fellow jury at the moment he's ready to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I do not believe that the collapse of the Trap is inevitable or that it will happen to its fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German leaders were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West opposed and supported him in Munich.
We've been out of the way for a long time, and we've been out of the way for years of avoiding the blood pressure that's going on.
History is spinning around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trampa is dismissed by General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the case of Mr. Miller?
Rozenstein has had difficulties since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly to enter into negotiations with the President and thought of his inapplicability to his office.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation on Brett Caveno will not be complete or honest or if he will be confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his unjust testimony and credible charges in the sexual assault?
And, what is the most important thing, will we vote for the mid-term vote of Congress, which will be called the Trampu for responsibility?
If we do not endure all these tests, democracy will rise to a long winter.
But I believe that everything will work out by referring to what we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once met in my household.
She survived, migrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the Sabbath candles on the table with a pillow.

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about fighting with Vienna "Rapid"
"Rangers" will take on the Thursday of Vienna "Rapid", knowing that victory over Austrians after an impressive undisclosed game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League G group.
The road trauma did not allow the centre's runner, Grem Dorans, to resume to the season's game until an undecided result with 2:2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," 31-year-old football player said.
"We went to the game to be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
We may have been able to do so at the end of the day, but in general, it is a noble result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we were in the second half and were better team.
And there will be another important night for Europe on Thursday.
Hopefully, we'll get three points, but it won't be easy because they got good results in the previous game, but I'm sure with the help of our supporters we'll be able to keep fighting and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was clearly difficult, but now there are new memories that I would feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue our fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are concerned about their pension contributions
Although the respondents knew clearly what care they wanted to receive, there were few people who had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of the subjects in the national study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want them to be cared for by family members, but nothing makes them talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known for a long time ago.
Work with your consultant and family to find out where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor involved. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with the amount of money to cover these costs, or security through your property, the main thing for you to have money.
Draw up your legal documents. Avoid legal battles before they begin.
Talk about the health of authorised persons so that you will be a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure the actions of specialists according to your wishes if you cannot express them to your own strengths.
Consider, too, the possibility of granting financial powers.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of the payment of your bill if you are unable to do so by your own power.
And don't forget the details. Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to the hospital to get help immediately.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in the written plan so that you will not be surprised at the situation.
"And this is not only about finances, but also about who is a doctor," Martina said.
"What are the medicines used?
What will you do about the dog?
Take care to develop such a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, a strong earthquake and tsunami, which visited the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, has killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will rise.
As a result of the outposted communications, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala (Dongala) area located north of Pala and is close to an epicenter of 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island Sulavesi. It is estimated that in 2017 it lived 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th century when the earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area close to 300 km (180 yards) along the north-west coast of Sulavesi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived in a province-based administrative area.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis for the economy of the province of Central Slaves, especially in the Danube region.
The acquisition of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Morowali), Sulavesi on the opposite coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, over the past 100 years, Paul and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and devastated hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
Cunami also gased over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is a six-dimensionally active Pacific fire in a circle where earthquakes are regularly formed.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in the north of Sumatra caused tsunamis on the west coast of Acehas (Aceh) on 26 December, which hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A strong series of earthquake hit the West of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias (Nia) on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6,8 magnitude earthquake was caused by Java, the most populated islands of Indonesia, in the south, causing tsunamis that broke down on the south shore, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake took place near the city of Padang — the capital of the province of Sumatra in the West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of Mentawai (Mentawai) islands on the coast of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters high tsunami waves that devastated tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The ground surface was approached by Pidi Jaya (Pidi Jaya) in Aceh, creating riots and panic, as it recalled the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunamis.
This time, the tsunamis were not formed, but more than 100 people were killed in the missing buildings.
2018: strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake robbed thousands of buildings, and in time hundreds of tourists were forced to return home.
Sara Pelina's oldest son arrested for his family violence
Treks Pelins (Track Palin), who was the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice-president of Sara Pelins, was arrested because he was accused of being attacked.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peillin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested in suspicion of domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman and woman tried to call the police to report what she said about the crimes she had committed, he picked up her phone.
Pelins has been detained in Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Authority, and he has a $500-dollar security deposit, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where, on the question of whether he would accept himself as guilty, he declared that "he is certainly not guilty".
Pélina has been accused of three Class A violations, which may result in years of imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which can be received daily imprisonment and a fine of $200.
This is not the first time that a criminal offence is brought against Pelina.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Totom Pelin.
Her mother, Sarah Pelinna, called the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently being dealt with by the Alysk Veterans Court.
In 2016, they were accused of domestic violence, of delaying the report on domestic violence and of carrying arms in the face of this incident.
Her friend says he's going to walk into it with a hole in his face.
In 2016, the groups of veterans criticized Sarah Pelinna for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes created in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after Friday in search of earthquakes in the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.
7.5 magnitudes caused tsunamis and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been demolished and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.

Federal Prosecutors would like to request a recently used death sentence for a person suspected of terrorist acts in New York City.
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of the death penalty Saïfullo Saifov (Sayfullo Saipov), who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. It is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed since 1953 in the state for federal crimes.
As stated, 30-year-old Saipov used home depot rental cars to attack a motorcycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drowned the riders and the riders on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 'with intent' killed eight victims and 'with intent' caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the notice of intent to request the death penalty lodged in the New York District Court.
In the case of both of these charges, it is possible to file a death penalty.
During the weeks following the attack, the Federal Supreme Court adopted a complaint concerning Saipova's appeal to 22 charges, which included eight charges of killings, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of non-violence and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and a prior intent", explained the prosecutors, saying that Saipova's attack was "indisputable, indiscriminate and inhuman".
Saifullo Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov) has injured, damaged and caused damage to these people's families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klives (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Dekadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darrens Dedigs (Darren Drake), Ariels Elihs (Ariel Erlij), Ern Feruči (Hernan Ferruch), Ernáns Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pagnocco (Alejandro Damian Pagnucco)," written in a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the New York District Court's prosecutors have carried out a case in which the death penalty can be prosecuted.
Khalid Barnes was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but in late 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death sentence was last executed in the New York federal case in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death in the face of a death sentence for their participation in the printing of the Council’s good news during the Cold War two years ago.
The death penalty for Rosenberg was executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret over the attack.
As the police report, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipovs told officials that he had gained the inspiration to make an attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also informed him that he had requested permission to place an ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected the 22 charges.
David Paton (David Patton), one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "unsatisfied by nature" about the indictment decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand a death penalty is not to accept the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the resulting trauma to all parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the award of the death penalty.
Conservative Member declares that the management of Brexit negotiations must be supported by the NAIDJEL FARÁZ
During the protest, Najgel Farajs promised to "mobilize the nation's army" at the conservative conference today.
The former leader of the British Independent Party announced that politicians should feel the wrath of European skeptics when one of the members of the Teres Mesa Parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should be based on him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative army, announced to the march in Birmingham that Britain would have been late if Mr. Faraža were the minister of Breksit.
However, the challenge that Mrs Mejas will face in trying to eliminate her opposition-stricken party showed conservatives who supported the EU's stay and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on future relations between Britain and the European Union (Checkers compromise), and to experience attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay the EU, and from the EU itself.
The public insisted that she would strive to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would allow Europeans and leborists to choose between her offer and "haosu".
Mr. Bona "Leave Means Leave" (Department) said in the town of Solihalla (Solihull) that he wanted to throw the Mejas plan in the mislain (to chuck Chequers).
He offered to make Pharaoh a friend and to trust him to speak to Brussels.
"If he had been speaking, we would have already left," Bones said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw out the Meja plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not want to serve!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr Bona ignored the assumptions that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their views and wants to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Breksita's supporter, Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the march, and the reporters said, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the citizens.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and for our supporters who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please respond to the Chequers and start listening."
As far as Mea was concerned, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians in the village must feel pressured if they are going to fail to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't let them do it."
In his message, he adds: "I would like you to allow our politicians, who are planning to move Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the fight for the Brexit, and we will never be free until we achieve that we are independent, sovereign, proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Palicians marched through Birmingham two hours before the city center took place.
The Activists did not know how to welcome the conservatives against Brexit banners after the group meeting this week.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservatives on the security issues they experienced with the party's applications at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the IT system's order and all their technology for Canada and still, undiminished, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.

From the time that Walter Bots qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.

It was a very bad body language
President Donald Tramps laughed at Senator Dian Feinstein in his Saturday home about her indiscriminateness not to utter a letter from Christian Bleissian Ford, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in a town in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly of Forda's testimony given to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, bad and incredible."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening during the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when it sees angry, wicked, accidental and incredible people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? "Oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it... No, we didn't do it," he added, senators in ton.

"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it too."
But her refusal was not to the president, who commented on this situation in the home of Saturday evening: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the complaint for their own benefit.
"They are targeted to regain power through any means."

Aviation crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people has died after a plane crash
The airline took a flight during which it landed in the Pacific Ocean basin in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people is missing, although before that it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing aircraft.
Air Niugini reported on a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline announced that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped to save other passengers and operate after the plane entered the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people had stayed in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
There are still unclear reasons for the accident and the sequence of events.
The carrier and the US fleet report that the aeroplane is entering the yard shortly after its departure from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses seemed to have reassessed the length of the flight.
The American passenger Bill Jens said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane using emergency exits, as the water was only up to the fork.
He said that he panicked and knelt, as well as that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy mariners working nearby to improve the ship’s port also helped rescue operations by using an inflatable ship to deliver people to the shore before the flight of about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last 20 years of the PNG registered airlines, none of them related to Air Niugini.
The psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events at night in which life was burned by a woman
The complaint presented evidence on Saturday repeated in the case in which a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Commentary on psychoanalysis by the U.S. Department of Justice, Pols Rovlets, demonstrated for several hours as a witness expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the dreamers how he used the information he had received from the phone to gather together how the newly accused Quinton Tellis was doing on the night of her death, and 19 years later, when Jessica Chambers died.
Rovlet said he had received location data from several phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, questioning his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he claimed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford, in courtroom on Saturday, showed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accused asked whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he "was lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another mistake was that Tellis said that she knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only know each other for weeks.
Rovlet said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis would delete the messages, calls and contact information received from Chambers.
"He will wipe him out of his life," said Heil.
It is expected that defences will provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the victims later that same day.

Black again?
In New York, a couple complained about rebuffing after receiving "racist" news
In New York, a couple in court complained about a discriminatory dismissal after she had received an error of sending a short message from a mother who complained that the uncle "is still black."
Couples refuse to be racist by comparing the trial case to "extension".
Lindsia Plasko-Flasman, a mother of two children, expressed her refusal to know that the new baby care provider, Gizel Maurissa, was a black man when she came to work the first day of 2016.
"NATIONALLY, APPLY MELNAIS," Plasco-Flasman wrote to his husband in a short time.
However, she did not send a message to her husband, but to Maurice, twice as much.
Aware of his inaction, Plasko-Flatsman dismissed Maurizu, pointing out that his previous cold, African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipinos to respond to the New York Post.
Mauricio paid for her one day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurisa has appealed to the court for compensation for her dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which she initially applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," she said on Friday "Post", adding "I know it is discrimination."
Some reject the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the termination of Maurit’s employment was a reasonable decision, for they feared that they would not be able to trust her after her insult.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joels Plasko, the husband, said "Post".
"But would you entrust your children to someone you've been dealing with ass, even if it was just because of the mistake?
Your newborn?
But think about it."
The court's sittings compared to "pressing", Plasko said his wife had been born a little only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"You're really looking at something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment bank added.
As long as there is still trial, public opinion is quickly being tried over social networks, rejecting them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with the speaker.
Bonda's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in a basket," which read the book for the first time before it was issued.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator of BBC before he felt the inspiration to write a book to children about a small toy, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet acid" after his father’s departure last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted of his possible success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like, if you have a child who achieves something: you would be proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to leave my dying daughter by phone
After her daughter died, she was taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not survive," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I received a call from Ned, saying that she would die within two minutes and I had to leave her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "That's right, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly ended and left her body.
She would have died even faster and it all ended now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not enjoy or cry because I would find myself in a situation where there were families and people around me.
I needed a lot of power to control."
In the end, then the devastating loss of the daughter, Ednana-Laperuza, got on the plane with other passengers who were not even impressed with her going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but right on the flight, I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pregnant women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicides
Two women whose love has led people to commit suicide are acting to help others not to take life away from themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrija strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Daivis’s son, Tailar, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davisa, 45, who lives in Lydia, said that her son was a promising spring with a smile of dependence.
"Everyone recognized him by laughing.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he gave up his job before he died, because he was "bad, very dark."
In 2014, Tailera’s brother, now 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created cards, "to let me know that there are people you can cut and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit down quietly - you have to talk."
Hamfria, who has been a friend of Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He did not say that I would feel sad or depressed or that I would feel in any way," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
Her death was a great trauma for children, but they had to end it by saying, "It commands the whole family.
That's what we're dealing with.
But we must all continue and fight."

Breta Caveno's future in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he requires – in terms of time and volume – in a limited investigation – we could achieve little consensus," Fleke said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "participating" between a hard-on partisan entry.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republics not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their absence is only a coincidence.
Interference is five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to be ill, then their attempts will be much weaker to choose a man from among them in the highest court.
George V. Bush called Senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks him to his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats are now owned by the Republicans, but 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pensam, Vice-President, to vote and approve them in the Supreme Court.
Kima's management "reduced" number of North Korean political asylum seekers
North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea have decreased since Kim Jongs came back to power seven years, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seg, quoting the data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said that last year 1127 political asylum seekers were compared to 2011, when the number was 2706.
Parks said that the stronger border control of North Korea and China and the higher rates of smuggling of people are key factors.
Pyongyang has not submitted any public comments.
Most political asylum seekers from the end of North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and deported in a forced manner.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still in the technical war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met with Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclerisation negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Tramp and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for no progress since these negotiations.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally," Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nensija Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno "histories" and claims that he is not applicable to work in the Supreme Court.
The Court's minority leader Nensija Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno "historic" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on the interview "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the woman had done so, they would call him "historical," Pelosi said about his reaction to the witness given to the Senate's judicial commission on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally dismissed charges of sexual harassment for Dr. Kristina Blezi Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
In its initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost climbing and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against their accusations of "great and harmonious destruction", organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost his presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that the Kaveno evidence is the reason he cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think that he is disqualificating himself with such claims and attitudes as he is addressing Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked whether she would try to question Caveno if they were approved and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not fit for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the existing place of work in the court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno is now a judge at the Washington Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, Kaveno has been disappointed by the possibility of taking decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Type because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation negotiations, Kaveno questioned whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time to work in court with a historical and double-minded person, but we would expect to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," said Pelosios.
But women have to keep their hands.
It's a denunciation, months and years, it's all cut down on two sides, but she's not allowed to get it all out of her mouth.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Sometimes a woman who was the leader of a company who said she was crying when she was angry but made a technique — when she got angry and started crying, she told her person who was talking to her: "You can think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
Assars are recognised as a form of anger discharge only partially because they are simple on their own.
One of my greatest memories is of the former work of men, when I was once in tears of anger, when I was taken by an angry older woman, a staunch driver (a woman), who was always a bit afraid of me, who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see that it's red!" she said to me.
"They don't know that you're being transferred.
They think you're upset and just glad you got to "burn under your skin."
Patrizia Šrēdere, then a Congressman of the US Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hurts, who were engaged in foreign affairs, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and resigned from the elections, Šrēdere, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for the President's office.
"That was not a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to meet again.
There were those who called it "Swims and seven shoes."
She was later involved in the campaign, her retirement fundraiser, and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to men, had donated only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, stumbled into a system that made it very difficult to collect money and to talk to the electorate rather than to talk to the delegates, and angry about sexism — where she was "nominated".
"You would remember that I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder, as the press responded to him.
"You would remember that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my hat.
"She cried."
Why the US-China trade war can be beneficial for Beijing
The main objections to how the war between the US and China began to be hidden and, as long as the fight is not over, the disagreements between countries may be favourable to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
US President Donald Tramps issued a first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation started this week with new rates affecting the unit’s value of $200 billion (150 billion) and immediately leaving half of the goods exported from China.
Beijing is also responsible for "goods" every time, the youngest is five to ten percent of the cost of $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced its commitment to respond to one another and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy could be minimized in the near future.
In order to withdraw from Washington, certain requirements should be accepted, but publicly kneeling would be too insulting to China's President Xi Shi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the U.S. trade pressure can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision has been taken either in Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognized observers," said Abigail Greisa, a New American Security researcher focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to restore a country whose war has been raging for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid Almualems said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Now the situation on earth is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists in their normal condition.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almalems said that the Syrian regime would adopt assistance in the restoration of the state of exile.
But he stressed that the State would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to promote peace.
European golfing sensational victory in the Raidera Cup fight in Paris
The European golf course won the 2018 Raider Cup, winning the U.S. Championship with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered when the team led by Tomas Bjørn, the selection Danas, got 14.5 points needed to cross the US election.
The U.S. star, son of Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the whole tournament, entered his T-shirt in the water at PAR 3 on 16 April, joining a match in French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been playing at all stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won a 5-0-0 score since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
American Jordan Spyt with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, after a rating, to the lowest existing player Torbjornam Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, for which this was possibly the last chance of Raider.
Eight Rider Casuals veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player from Europe all the time with 25.5 career points.
"Of course I don't, but today I can't manage tears."
This was a heavy year.
From my heart, I am grateful to Thomas that he has brought me up and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the box.
It is a team's merit and I am glad that I could help," after the European election victory, Garcia said emotionally.
He goes on to give his people John Rama, who won the U.S. golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 games.
"The pride I felt when I won the Taiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23 years old Rams.
Vods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Rider case.
Statistics are not available to one of the best players all the time, who won the 14th-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent all week fighting to find its advantages, except for Patrick Ried, Justin Tomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course in the entire tournament.
U.S. election captain Jim Furick said after his team's unsatisfying performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they're fighting.
Yesterday was the time when we were able to create a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will be restructuring, I will work with the US PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to get your hats on.
We won."
Latest information on the red landscape: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Committee on Fisheries and Wild Animals (FWC) refers to the overall reduction in the concentration of red space in Tampas Bay areas.
According to the FWC, donating boards were reported in Pinel, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, which showed a decrease in concentration.
The red landscape blooms about 130 yards from the North Pole to the South Sea Coast line.
The plans are located about 10 yards from Hilsboro (Hillsborough) coastal areas, but in some places they last around a week.
The red landscape will also be evaluated in the Pasko area.
Last week average concentrations were reported in the Pines area or its coastal area, low to high concentrations in the Hilsboro coastal area, low to high concentrations in the Manat area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or in its coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or in its coastal area, and low concentrations in the colje area.
In the areas of Pines, Manats, Sarasotas, Li and Kolje, the respiratory system is still reported.
