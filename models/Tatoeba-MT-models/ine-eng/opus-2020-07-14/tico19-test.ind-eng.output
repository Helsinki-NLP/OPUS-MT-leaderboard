How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all breasts should be handled in this way especially at your age
And together with the rabbit.
and your blood pressure and cholesterol should also be checked
And are you being a fever now?
And do you feel these breasts now?
And are you also having trouble breathing?
And can you tell the other symptoms you've experienced along with these symptoms?
And have you ever reached how high your fever?
And I'm stuck too.
And I'm a little bit of a pimp and a little bit of a pimp

Is there someone else who's sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt tired of breathing?
Do you still feel chest pain?
'Cause this is the flu season
But we can't even afford to have a brain that's from the heart.
But the more important problem now is the brains of this
And I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know that a lot of people are in my way.
But we need to deal with every concussion very seriously.
But now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this chest.
Does it feel like someone's biting your chest?
still feels like a breather.

The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar train in the European Union/European Economic Area and the British Raya that confirms that, despite its varying degrees depending on the country, COVID-19 has developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, it is important to increase their readiness to launch COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia cluster with etiology was reportedly unknown in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Control and Prevention Centre Tigkok reported that this cousative agent is a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 sufferers have a slight disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of this disease healing.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 has developed into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases have a critical condition that requires intensive care.
Mortalitas patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 cumulative incident train of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it with the Hubei Province incident, Tiongkok.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy from 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After Tigkok, COVID-19 has been preaching geography further and dynamics through COVID-19 in the rest of the world now following the dynamics through Tigkok.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, on 5 March, Spiterie et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by people who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected across 30 EU/EEA and Ray Ingris (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get a cumulative number and a cumulative incident in the COVID-19 case
At the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide has been updated every day at 8.00 a.m., only from official sources such as Earth Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and UK, and compare it with the train in Italy.
As an active prevalence proxy for the COVID-19 case, we count the cumulative incident for 14 days, so count the natural journey COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided a cumulative number of cases reported to each country by 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared with Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
COVID-19-day cumulative incident train in the EU/EEA and the UK generally followed a train in the Province of Hubei (Tigkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to increase by 21 February, and then increased by 28 February 2020.
This train is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show the same cumulative COVID-19 increase in incidents.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggests that, by 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The train watching the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicated that the pancreas increased at a speed comparable to that in all countries.
This is derived from the differences in degrees between countries, variations in public health response, and the possibility of differences in the definition of a case between countries and the differences in protocol to choose the patient to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes a pregnancy test.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that the hospital and intensive care unit in the region had reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 cases in the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are available only for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care and mental care facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and medical treatment for 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The model scenario is related to the lack of health care capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases of acute care for each EU/EEA country and UK associated with risk >90% of the sleeping capacity of intensive care, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Because so far the case is classified in certain areas in EU/EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a limited population of certain regional services, information on the case and place of intensive care should be provided at the level of the U.S. Regional Survey for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current train in another country shows that the COVID-19 panmeal has developed very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and increase the number of COPID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, as in the most affected areas in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk analysis, fast, proactive, and understanding approaches are very important to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 ministry, with a change from a narrow approach to a mitigation approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give the decision makers enough time to understand, accept, and accept the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also triggered public health steps to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
A short chance window is available when the country has the opportunity to improve its control in slowing down SARS-COV-2 and reducing the stress on health care.
In the event of failure, the EU/EEA national health care system may be faced with a patient who needs intensive care in a few days or weeks ahead.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tigkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
It smells like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the tunnel and caused symptoms similar to those of a similar mechanism.
Even so, COVID-19 has lower levels of obesity and mortality than SARS, but more and more about age than young people, and more on men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and understandable updates on the subject of rapid research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this development will help us to understand and fight this dangerous disease.
The Semi Festival, on January 25, 2020, has become a memory that has never occurred and has not been forgotten for all Tighoa people who were ordered to stay at home during vacations and a few weeks later because of the new virus disease.
This virus is very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was given the name SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic is beginning in Wuhan, Tigkok, and is rapidly spreading throughout the country and in almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients being released and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is an "enemy number 1 enemy and potentially destroys more than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nhiv.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, which established a virus isolated from several patients, more than 200 were published about COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
The goal is to include research progress in this fast - growing field of new subjects.
Perhaps we will try to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and the disease caused by other CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 plague).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting, as well as some questions that have not yet been answered.
Based on tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the 4th arrow.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the ongoing plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why COVID-19 is now the third coV wave in human history.
As shown at Gbr. 1.1, pneumonia was originally unknown for the first time from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of the Tigkok People’s Republic on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, a coV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, a health care infection was reported, indicating that human-human transmission could happen.
On January 23, a district convention was held in Wuhan, and all general prejudice was stopped.
On January 24th, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly associated with the Wuhan marine food market considered to be the initial infection site of unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared this plague an emergency of global health.
During this reporting period, the disease has spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because of the rapid development of the situation, the end of the world and the spread of disease still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study in 8.866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bddA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50 years old, only a few are under 20 years old, and only 14 are infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expands into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes an average time of 5 (2-9) days beginning from abstinence to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is adjusted by 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan 2020, according to the time of mass transportation before the Semi Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases total 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality adjusted for all patients total 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are type of male, age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a large virus assembled with a single RNA sensor.
CoV can be divided into four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-COV known to be human infection.
Glycoprotein tonolan or spice (S) is a compound associated with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2), and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptide each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene is released into the sytoplasm; after replication by the virus, the genomic RNA is included in the glucoprotein strain and the nucleocapid protein form the virus-filled vesicular, which is then experienced by fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-coV type with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the original location of the Pacific Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through electron microscopes of transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium of a very typical human breath.
ACE2 humans were found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S SARS-COV-2 protein is associated with ACE2 humans weaker than the S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes non-separable infection of SARS-COV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is assigned to orf3b and a protein that is assigned to the orf8 sand.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may be active in viral pathogenesis and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a known functional or motif domain.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the entire human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 Å in complex with amino B0AT1 asthma transporter.
They found that a complex, which has open and closed conformation, is formed in diameter and an ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which is evidence of coV detection and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in the drugstore to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to come from the periphery and each is transmitted to humans through the ossuary and the ossuary.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coV, the vortex is considered to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two coVs like-sars from the vortex called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermarriage that helps the virus to overcome the barrier of species to infected humans is still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. sent the snake as a virus driver from the pelvis to humans involved in homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, recommend that the pancreas, the mummies mongoose long food that is often used in traditional thionghoa drugs, potentiates as a donor between SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of 99% genetic homologous to coV found in the pancreas and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the widely distributed difference throughout the genome is still a big difference; therefore, the results of concrete evidence are not yet available.
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not known in most cases.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40-50% to reach the target.
SARS-COV-2 may have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine-containing infection, acid acidity, chloroform, and other fat predators, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disables the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and therefore it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies that report immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only refer to another coV research before, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after an inhaler invasion, the virus is known by the immune system to be taken through a pool receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a variety of pathways, the virus induces the expression of the inflammatory factor, dendritic cell maturation, and type I (IFN) interferon synthesis, which limits the virus to spread and accelerates the phagositosis of the antigen virus by macrophages.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Soon thereafter, adaptive response joins in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cell stimulation B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill cells that are directly infected by the virus.
T-cells help produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
Even so, CoV can block the T cell function by inducing the T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also important in the fight against virus infections.
For example, the insulated antibody of a patient who has been cured controls the mers-coV.
On the other hand, excessive immune response produces a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst of scenarios, failure to control organs and even death.
Sars-CoV-2 infection, which is marked with abitudinal cluster, is more about age with cervical disease and pregnant women.
In general, people who are infected with the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on studies on the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and the cycle starts from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographics 8.866 cases.
Most importantly, health authorities adjust effective quarantine based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a general practice, those who are infected with the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should it take a quarantine period of up to 24 days?
Demam is often the principal and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without any other symptoms such as dry rock, breathlessness, muscle sneezing, swelling, headache, throat disease, kidney disease, chest sneezing, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after treatment with disease.
In severe cases, the development of patients’ disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic associasis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms and fever, even if there is no leukaemia, should be vaccinated against the virus for diagnosis of dengue.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that the percentage of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for dry rock, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% for patients need fan support.
The same findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in the family and the cluster that caused transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Compared with that, the 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), fever (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patient and consistent with MERS mortality higher than COVID-19.
Diaret (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dizziness (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and hypertrophy (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation support needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 accounted for 10% of 8.096 confirmed cases.
For Mers, based on a study of demographics in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a height of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only crosses 2 to 4.
Compare SARS-COV-2 to MERS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-COV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but not semi-automatic MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 panmea is greater than the MERS-CoV panmea and SARS-CoV.
Avitan is often found in a family or from a group or a vehicle such as a beachboat.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before an aviation.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been removed from the hospital can carry the virus again.
At the initial stage, the patient has normal or decreased white cell counts of peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia increased in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The incidence of heart and muscle enzymes and myoglobins increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood vessels are rising in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer increased, i.e. the product of fibrin analysis in the blood, and lymphocyte count decreased gradually.
The lack of photos of the chest was found in as large a COVID-19 patients and marked with a bilateral shadow or background-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute leukaemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS happens, tattercontrolal inflammation, accumulation of fluids, and progressive fibrosis are very exacerbating gas exchange disturbances.
The type I and type II pneumonia function lowers the surface level and increases the surface pressure so that it lowers the ability of the lungs to develop and increase the risk of lung collapses.
Therefore, the worst finding of a torcotic picture is often parallel to the worst disease rate.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumonia, the formation of hialin membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltrates, as well as the emotional cells involved in many patients who died of this disease, according to infectious pathologies virus and ARDS and similar to patients' pathology analysis SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through a polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of its false negative rate, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is not only dependent on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred in SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease historians, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the SHERLOCK-based technical usage protocol to detect SARS-COV-2, which detected synthetic RNA fragrances SARS-COV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cell stick within an hour without need of complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if checked on a clinical sample.
Because it's less experienced with the new CoV, the doctor in particular offers supportive care to the COPID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously sent to other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral disease (Table 2).
This treatment includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered, traditional Tinghoa medications, and psychological support.
Even plasmas from patients who have been cured are recommended to be used in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company is developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and ginja.
However, the operation and lack of breathing are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease progression.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the most modified cardiopulmonary gateway technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, electrolyte balance care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protection of vital organ function are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive immune response is known to cause cytokines in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of a cytokine sequence, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These sitokins inducing immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and fail to detect organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of sytokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to handle sitokin storms.
Another immunosuppression treatment for cytokines involves modulation of the immune response transmitted to T cells; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; implanting the cytokine 4 signal; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce inflammation damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for heavy lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can cause side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly affects prognosis.
However, short-dose corticosteroids are provided at a low dose until it is recommended to be administered with caution to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of this investigation, there was no effective anti-virus therapy that had been confirmed.
However, the remdesivir intravenously, i.e. a nucleotide analogue, was found to be secretive in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In recent years, remdesivir has also shown inhibition of other single-cell RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
On this basis, Gilead provided this life for Tigkok to do a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the results were very welcome.
In addition, baracitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and developed antibodies
There is a long history of patient blood collection that has been healed of a terminal disease to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent the affected person from being treated with it.
Of course, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecule on pathogen, and directly control it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from a blood group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are administered to 10 patients with severe disease.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification have to be made to recommend this method for the use of a large scale prior to the development of specific therapy.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune response over time and cause cytokine discharge syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
Antibodies in the blood are usually low, and plasma is required in large numbers to treat patients with critical disease.
The development and production of specific antibodies is fast enough to combat the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have been cured and to identify genetic code that involves effective antibodies or to make effective antibodies to proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily improve the level of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tigkok for thousands of years.
However, most effects depend on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, because there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative therapy for patients with mild symptoms until they are or for those who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be suitable for COVID-19 therapy.
The recovery rate in the COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in several Tigkok provinces that used the TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which used the CCM only in about 30% of the COVID-19 patients, had a lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very severe because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be considered in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends involved a study comparing Western drug therapy (WM) to WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and the lack of care was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More impressive, the rate of symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Even so, the effectiveness and security of TCM is still waiting for the best-controlled test on a larger scale and at more research centres.
The other interesting thing is to create a working mechanism and explain the effective components in the TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of a very painful and even fatal disease, and those who are also suffering from fatigue, loneliness, and anger.
Further, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and bowel and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause increased anxiety and mental pressure.
At the early stages of SARS, a group of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor gleaming, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Identifying contacts and mandatory quarantines, as part of a public health response to COVID-19, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of revulsion, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, those expected, and those who contact them, and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine development and accurate information about SARS-CoV-2, and the therapy plan and the use of devices and professional electronic applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to break the transmission chain from animal and human reservoirs that are infected with depleted mucous membranes and often predispose to antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the outbreak of the virus.
It has been done to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which is long and effective in producing neutralising antibodies and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live vaccines have been evaluated on a test animal.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before clinical trials begin.
This may be because SARS was working 17 years ago and there's no new case reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic case and the MERS cluster continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the region of the endemic.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by disabling viruses, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on test animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunists is a very urgent and important task to control the epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome because of the long time to develop the vaccine (a rate of 18 months) and the variant of the dynamic coV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just began to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may be able to heal without delay.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a disease forecast model is very important for the health care body to prioritise its service, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may be affected or associated with the forecast of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS forecast, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study with 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have comorbidity and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median 66 years of age compared with 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
The sex type: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
The heart also destroys the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be related to collangositis with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart failure in the COVID-19 patient.
It has to be noted that age and underlying illness are very similar and have an impact on one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or chain injury and is caused as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlation between the CRP level and the vulnerabilities and the COVID-19 forecast has also been established.
In addition, increases in dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional signs of heart and heart function.
The main clinical symptoms: photos of the chest and the development of the temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the outcome and complexity of the COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as anti-infectious therapy to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer from atrial osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term exposure to COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 period, many patients suffer extreme stress because they have to carry out long-term and extreme uncertainty and see the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on a demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiology that differs from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replication in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stages of infection, similar to other coV that cause fibrillation.
Therefore, at an early stage or incubation time, the infected patient can produce a large number of viruses during daily activity, which causes a major difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-COV transmissions are believed to occur when severe patients and most do not occur at the early stages.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is much worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
At present, a major effort is being made in Tingkok, which includes the Quarantine of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the Quarantine, almost all of the population, with the hope of breaking the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this is a serious economic downturn and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has dropped, indicating the epidemic range.
The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end in March and the breeding phase will take place for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be much worse than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
Canada's research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a mid-congested phase and infested patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus can be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, the signs of the promise take place in Tiongkok, if it is seen on the basis of a new number of cases, which show that the strategy at this time might work.
The foretold Ebola would cause one million cases of death as well as half of them.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a non-pathogen virus that can be side-by-side with humans.
Compare the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit by means of a stick or a sieve, and perhaps by contacting directly with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the faeces so that it could trigger a new transmission, i.e. the fee-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with previous disease and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful preventive action should be taken to protect humans, especially those who provide health care, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be in contact with patients or people who are infected.
The first defense line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both the different masks and the respiratory masks N95 (the 1860s) help control the virus.
Medical masks ensure that the spleen of people who have the potential for infection is neither air-tight nor soiled on the surface of the material, where the spleen can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (the 1860s) that can protect against virus inhale with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can completely enter; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because the particles can concentrate even five surgical masks that have been dropped into one, the health care provider that directly contacts the patient has to wear N95 (the 1860s) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers have to wear appropriate insulation clothing to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
Therefore, the health care provider should also wear a face mask or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap is infected more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine, and avoid contact with people who have the potential for infection.
Three legs are assured appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologous to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a major warning to Tigkok who has strong memories of the SARS plague in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and control of this disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fear of society, especially when the whole country is preparing the Semi Festival, so that this critical time has passed to cope with a disease that is still small in Wuhan.
The control body in Tigkok should take note of this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decision; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-clinical information than waiting for official reports from a doctor or official; (3) more limiting the use of the epidemic potential at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequently releasing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of the disease and to test and increase the public response system periodically.
The COVID-19 virus is caused by a new SARS-COV-2 virus that began to sink at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Tigkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this census.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the COVID-19 symptoms and SARS, the COVID-19 tumors have effects like the SARS tumors again.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to deal with the epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher at age than young people.
SARS Mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill.
This explains some of the causes of SARS-CoV-2 spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA bases to check SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has been cured can again produce positive results for virus testing.
This finding greatly increased the risk of viral transmission.
As soon as the COVID-19 research has progressed, some important problems still have to be solved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a total of 96% of the genetic homologies were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs like SARS-COVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 came from the cluster.
What kind of animal is the middle species to trace the virus from the original source, tell the glaucoma, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't break the transmission effectively and the damage can be re-burned at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical bases show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause further pathological changes?
Is this virus also associated with an ACE2-expressed cell in another organ?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go on?
How did the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pancreas be pancreas all over the world, ends up like SARS, or repeats periodically like flu?
The answers to the above questions and many more are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Human crownary zoonotic virus origin
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of the corona virus (CoV) and its ingenuity, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coVs (HCOVs) were known to cause minor diseases, such as strokes.
The acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) shifts the condition and reveals how highly harmful and life-threatening HCV infections can be.
The beginning of SARS-CoV-2 at the center of Tigkok in late 2019 has made CoV a reincarnation and surprised us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenesis than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HPOV infection is zoonoses, so the original zoonotic understanding of HCOV will benefit us.
Most of the HCOVs come from the galaxy, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some HCOV reserves have also been identified.
Animal identification has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Researching coV-ingen interactions on animals can also provide an important monitoring of coV pathogenesis on humans.
In this quest, we provide a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCOVs, focusing on its conservation history and its zoonotic origin and transmission of its interspecies.
The important thing is, we're comparing and interfering with the HCOV from the perspective of evolution and gene recombination.
The epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the association between successful and successful exchanges and the involvement of virus evolution in disease disorders is also rooted.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, composed of a group of RNA viruses surrounded, positive intermittent, and single-shot.
This virus has the largest gene of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called CoV, because it's morphology that looks like a crown under electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has a non-segmentated gene that has a similar landing.
Approximately two thirds of the gene consists of two large open-label reading sequences (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined with each other. Both are transmitted as polyproteins of the replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has further exacerbation to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining gene consists of an open-label reading range (ORF) for structural protein, which includes tonjolan or spike (S), cover or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins specific to a specific sequence of offspring are also identified by a variety of CoV sequences.
Based on protein sequences, CoV is classified as four types (alpha-coV, beta-coV, gamma-coV, and delta-coV); among these four types, the beta-coV gene has more than the number of HCV and is further divided into four offspring (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that the vertebrates and ruminants are the source of a large proportion of alpha-coV and beta-coV, while the urea is the main reservoir of gamma-coV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the barrier of species and some CoV has become an important pathogen for humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs (HcoVs) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-COV.
The other five beta-coVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, acute coronary syndrome virus (SARS-COV), Central Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-COV), and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as itching and/or diarrhoea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections to be more severe in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing to be acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
The first line of HCV-229E, B814, is isolated from a patient's insomnia in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which have caused healing itself.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS plague that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating diseases in the current history, which infected more than 8,000 people with a severe death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused a series of epidemics on the Arab weekend by spreading propaganda to other parts of the world.
The new HCOV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-COV-2, is a cossatative agent of the epidemic virus corona 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm's gone, and the world has to prepare for the next SARS-COV-2.
The seven HCOVs all have the zoonotic origins of the vertebrae, the mouse, or the pet.
A lot of evidence supports the evolution of all HCOVs from the galaxy. In the galaxy, the coV is well-adopted and nonpathogenic, but it shows great genetic perception.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created a huge medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for Tigkok and the whole world.
The discovery of HCOV's zoonotic origins gave the workforce a sense of natural history, the ability to move, and the determinant effect of movement among species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for animal reserves, intermediates, and sars-coV-2 amplifications, which have important implications for the early prevention of the field ministry.
In this quest, we gave a general picture of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmissions, and HCOV pathogens.
We specifically monitor and discuss the general topic that the HCOV invertebrate virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogen after transmission of interspecies to new vessels.
We also surveyed the HCOV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenesis.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first strain of HCOV-229E, the first strain B814 of a rare patient, various coVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last generations, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The short history of HCV findings in the chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first line of HCV-229E is isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that experienced upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which is further adapted to be created on the WI-38 stem cell line.
The infected patient HCOV-229E showed a spleen symptoms, including headache, dizziness, leukaemia, and gout disease, including fever and skin seen on 10~20% of the case.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and a series of pathways in the brain that were still squeezing.
The clinical description of HCV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCV-229E, which cannot be automatically distinguished with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and Rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 spread throughout the world and tend to be the most transmitted during the winter in the surrounding area.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a period of illness for about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E have had a low incidence of strokes.
Only a few patients with a system of weakness of the body that shows lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is a pantheon of the first HCOV documented well in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-COV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tigkok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, widespread in many countries and countries.
Apart from the superintendent, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation time 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus appears on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients initially infected with SARS-CoV have myalgia, headache, fever, leukaemia, and gingivitis, followed by dyspnoea, sneezing, and breathing disorders as a further rate of symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increase in kinase creatinine are laboratory abnormalities that develop in SARS.
Loss of alveolar infusions, epithelium proliferation, and macrophages increase were also observed in patients with SARS.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a sytokin storm, which can kill, especially in patients who have a weak immune system.
The virus was first isolated from porous biopsy opened to zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been made to study the HCOV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from children aged 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus is initially very sensitive to young children, to old age, and to patients whose inability to cope with respiratory disease.
Corrosion, conjunctivitis, fever, and acute bronchiolitis are found in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from the male nasal specimen of 8 months old who suffers pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it has been widely distributed throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and its peaks occur at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx, which is also referred to as corrugated.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated with pneumonia and bronchiulitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolites, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, caused a slight respiratory disease.
Four of these HCOV communities have completely adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into a very pathogenic disease. However, the extraordinary case is certainly due to unknown reasons, as in the case of subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulent recently reported causes of low respiratory tract infection in Tionkok.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and keep on defending itself within humans, the virulence and pathogens of HCOV are also diminished.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who experienced acute pneumonia and failed to heal in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the case of imports with one second of their contact details has been reported in various European and Turkish countries.
Another second wave took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Mers clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which are inspired by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also experienced acute failure, which so far only happened on MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases have been reported with high death rates of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-COV one of the most feared viruses known by humans.
In mid to the end of December 2019, a retrospectively related pneumonia patient cluster associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
World Health Organization (WHO) said that the underlying respiratory tract infection is ongoing and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the Global Health Law and called it COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the number of fatalities of a total of 3.4%.
It has to be recorded, death in Hubei, Tingkok, about 4.2%, while death outside Hubei is about 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV with the image of fever, hail, and breathlessness.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide sequence homologies, a total of 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
The sars-coV-2 pathogenisity is clearly lower, but more than sars-coV and mers-coV.
The infected subjects SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may be active in the rapid SARS-CoV-2 field worldwide.
Comparing and comparing SARS-COV-2 with six other HCV shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation and duration of HCOV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows the general six other HCOV trains.
Second, the COVID-19 distribution is located between SARS-COV and four other HCV communities (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a more general picture of the HCV community infection, which includes non-specific mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVID-19 case can look like SARS-COV infection even with a slightly lower race.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting field characteristics, having interactions with the HCOV community or SARS-CoV.
On one side, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least the same as the HCV community.
On the other hand, none of the transmission capabilities of SARS-COV-2 are down after a few human routes still need to be verified, such as the SARS-COV and MERS-COV case.
Finally, just like the other HCV, SARS-COV-2 can be detected from the faeces sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral important, as in the case of the transmission of SARS-CoV, at least in a particular situation, that still needs to be explained by the next study."
The very important thing to know is whether SARS-COV-2 is seasonally such as in the case of the HCOV community.
Anyway, the images of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenesis, and preaching in a number of lines on humans, will have a profound impact on the fate of the final COVID-19 wave that is going on.
Four HCOV communities that cause light symptoms have all been accepted by humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be a species of surveillance of the HCOV pandemic in the past.
HCOV, which causes severe disease to humans and humans who have severe HCOV disease, has disappeared.
In order for this to happen, the HCOV must replicate in humans in a quantity that is sufficient to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to be used against the decommissioning factor.
As a result, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 disease persists and the more infected, the greater the likelihood of this virus being fully susceptible to humans.
If the virus fits well, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, the four coV communities have gone into the human population and have been chasing people with immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need animal reserves.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV that are very pathogenic have not yet been approved with humans and its transmission in humans cannot be defended.
Both of them had to defend themselves and do so in a zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to reach the human target, possibly through one or more intermediates and acclimatizations.
SARS-COV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to broadcast like the HCV community, at least now.
However, SARS-COV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCV community and not a septogene SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and circulating in humans without animal reserves or intermediates.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, we need to consider the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary animals, nature, reservoirs, centres, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as the evolutionary honeybee of HCOV if they have close-rooted rabbits and share high homologies at a nucleotide sequence.
An extraterrestrial virus usually fits well and is nonpathogenic in this mucous membrane.
Similarly, HCOV has been on the move for decades and in a long time.
In these two cases, the infected human being is naturally native to the HCOV or the ingenious virus.
On the other hand, if the new HCV enters the mid-range exactly before or about the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet been approved with the new and often pathogenic properties.
This medium can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification agent by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCOV can experience a flu infection if it can't maintain transmission in the intermittent frame.
On the other hand, HCOV may also be able to adapt to interdependence and even cause long - term endearment.
In this regard, the apostle Paul wrote: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near. ”
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveal that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with hunting animals.
The next study of seroprevalence indicated that the animal salesman had a higher IgG anti-SARS-COV prevalence than the general population.
The month's age and the dog's cancer in the animal market are the first to be identified with a type-SARS-COV virus that is almost identical to SARS-COV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all claims in the market were killed.
In this respect, it is reported that the monthly average of the wild or farmed animals that are not visible to the animal market in most cases produces negative results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the monthly average may only act as an amplification factor, but not as a natural resource for SARS-CoV.
It has to be noted, because 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be counterbalanced that possibly many small mammals also function as the cause of the SARS-CoV amplification.
All these bees seem to be Saras-CoV's last bees.
A natural animal search for SARS-CoV further revealed the nearby coV gate, called the CoV gate Rhinolopus gater HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located in Tigkok's yard.
This kelevase produced a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a sequence through SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV channels share a nucleotide sequence 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that the effusion is good for a new human pathogen.
Some coVs like-SARS (SL-CoV) were also identified from the vulnerabilities, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is a known recipient of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from the faeces sample is shown using an ACE2 channel, the lens, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
What's interesting is that the sarcasm of patients with SARS convalesen can control WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely-attached strain of SARS-CoV in the pelvis, with a 95 percent nucleotide homology.
Apart from the homologous height between these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV induction virus and the wire is not a direct SARS-CoV reservoir.
Phylogenetic analysis group MERS-COV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-COV use the same yellow receptor, which is a peptide 4 (DPP4) peptide, as a way into the virus.
The RNA polymerase sequence depends on the Mers-CoV RNA in a phylogenetic way closer to its strains in the beta-CoV cells identified by Europe and Africa.
So far, there's no MERS-COV alive found in the wild bay.
MERCS-COV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 is only sharing 87% of the nucleotide homologies.
That's why, the hatchery may not be worth a direct MERS-CoV reservation.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab ovaries produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that centralize MERS-CoV, similar to that of the Middle East in some African countries.
MERCS-COV lives identical to the virus found in humans are isolated from the Arab nasal oppus. This further indicates that the unta is the actual tanker for MERCS-COV.
It is also important to note that massive virus mutations with symptoms that are usually mild to the attention of the test vessels infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be noted, the eggs that are infected require not only virus through respiratory route, but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission from the pelvis.
Even so, the question is still not answered because many of the confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contacts with the novels before the outbreak, the possibility of human-human transmission or the unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species that carries MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologies with the CoV ratG13 insulated from the Rhinolophus affinis insulate.
Like in the Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV case, the difference between Sars-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to establish an innate relationship.
In other words, the tunnel may not have a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, unless the coV is found almost identical in later days.
It is likely that the animals between SARS-CoV-2 are among the wild mammals sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many early COVID-19 cases relate to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to humans.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as manis javanica, may also bring an extra-beta-coV that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV trigger gene divides 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homologies with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is as close to the RATG13 as 90% at a nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two subgenital viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is part of a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino sequence of 97.4%.
The thing is, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 are even more different, even though the homologous level is a whole lot higher.
A previous study on a disease-related disorder also reported contigo virus detection from a lung sample, which appeared to be also in contact with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of recovery and I think manual to produce a partial gene sequence consisting of about 86.3% complete virus.
We can't afford the possibility of a collision as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from the strain because the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 slope.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives of SARS-COV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary trails on the blind, the dissipation, and the other mammary still have to be set.
Although the highest homologous on RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV related saRS-CoV-2 straining, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homolog at the level of the entire gene.
It's too speculative to say that the high level of absorption between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-COV-2 intruders and SARS-COV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution of its selectivity mediated.
The comparison hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 in the third wild species.
As an evolutionary factor, the recombination occurs a lot between beta-coV.
Researchers still can't decide about the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, zoonotic origins HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been analysed.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may come from a coV channel, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 invertebrates have been found in animals.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected on the North American three-coloured tunnel shows a near-death with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E genetically interacted with the other coV gateway, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae, is also expected to be among its causes.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCOV animals is well known in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has given evidence of the transmission of HCOV interspecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed the species of animal to infect humans, it was recorded as a pancreatic respiratory infection.
The history of HCV-229E transmissions is not too clear.
The alpha-coV channel that is in contact with the HCOV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's an alpha-coV alpha.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from the blind to humans.
First, humans, not the alpha, that may have contact with the stars in the ecological relays together.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpha.
Second, the alpha-coV channel that is affected by HCV-229E has a variety of types and nonpathogenics in the tube, while the alpha-coV layer causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coV alpha was not found in the wild animal.
Therefore, the possibility of alpha-coV-families-HcoV-229E from humans cannot be approached.
In fact, the glaucoma is a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
That's why, it's not too surprising that the wire might directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
In other cases, while the alpha-coV channel functions as the HCOV-229E lung, alpha and ion Arab may function as an intermittent channel that transmits the virus to humans, just like the MERS-coV case.
MERCS-COV is a very good example of transmitting interspecies from the periphery to the Arab womb and from the Arab womb to the human.
The origin of the MERS-CoV evolutioner from the cave is known for the initial identification of the virus and also strengthened by finding it after.
Clearly, the pelvis is the lung of a rich virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments of the interspecies and transmission of the interspecies.
A long age, a close colony, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are a condition that supports the blind to be an ideal 'virus preacher'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab fair for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the eggs that have changed from intermediate to stable and natural reservoirs.
MERCS-COV causes very light disease and protects the relatively low mutagenic rail in this animal.
Its broadcasts to humans happen by chance and humans continue to be worthy of the end for MERS-COV because its transmission can't be disrupted.
It's not like an unintended role in the Mers-CoV transmission, a fragmented role, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
In particular, the beta-coV-intercept is highly pathogenic in the interference.
Attrition may be the end of the beta-coV relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the assumption in the SARS-CoV case.
In incoming studies, some possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be calculated or approximated.
First, the gateway could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological reverberation with the glaucoma by means of refurbishment or rocking.
Second, the breach could be one of the intermediate amplifications for the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that just came in.
Humans get viruses through the fertilization and consumption of fish meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, are slowing down on SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies to pets and wild animals need to be monitored.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that has a good relationship with the bat or the bat.
The original search for SARS-CoV-2 animals is still in progress.
Apart from various animal species, three major factors from the virus side are also important to facilitate the coV through the barrier of species.
First, the relative rate of mutation is high in the RNA replication.
Compared to another single-accelerated RNA virus, the CoV mutation's estimate can be considered as "situated" to "high" with the average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per sample, depending on the CoV adaptation phase towards new fee.
CoV has exoribonuclease preorientation, elimination that causes very high variability, attenuation, or even inviability.
What's interesting is that the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress coV replication by inhibition of this exorubinuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the COV mutation is about a million times higher than the COV mutation.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when CoV is not accepted with honey.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutations, the SARS-CoV-2 mutations are actually lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-COV-2 has been chosen with other paints that hurt close to human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also happens on the MERS-CoV that's agreed with the Arab novels.
Theoretically, there is little chance that genetic degradation will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA in the CoV provides additional flexibility in the change in the trom, for mutations and recombination, so as to increase the probability of co-evolution of the interspecies, which would encourage the emergence of the CoV when appropriate.
This is supported by many unique reading ranges and protein functions at the end of 3′ ome.
Third, CoV often turns flat during RNA replication through the unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In gears that function as a means of fusion, the urinary replacement occurs often during the transcription of RNA CoV.
A complete and very homologous subgenum RNA can be recombined to form a new coV.
The phylogenetics of natural recombination have been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animals such as SL-COV and CoV-HKU9.
Virus-inhaler interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the honey receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-COV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the transmission of interspecies.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and mice, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various cones, especially with mutations on RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target of angina antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid to 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which is associated with ACE2 humans and its correspondent as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-COV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include anorexia, musculoskeletal, mouse, and cancer dogs, thus allowing transmission of interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino residues observed differ between human virus isolates and isolates in RBD and 4 among them are located on the receptor binding motifs for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV is supposed to have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonolan protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
It has to be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein S unit involves the affinity of protein S binding with ACE2 humans may have changed.
In fact, a crypt-EM study shows human ACE2 binding affinity and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than human ACE2 affinity and SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's another corridor that might be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-terasetylase acid for HCV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the achievement of this coV adaptation in humans after transmission of the interspecies of its animal origin.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end-of-transmission of the HCOV interspecies is also organized by the interspecies of interspecies, interspecies, interspecies, interspecies, and interspecies.
The difference between humans and nature reserves, such as the eels, the Arabian ostrich, and the predators, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The HCOV must take a change in the detonation factor and bind the detonation factor to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular pen in the field of the interaction of these important viruses still have to be identified and detected.
The full-scale converter to see the interdependence and decomposition factor SARS-CoV-2 uses the highest CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCOV Start: Back to the beginning of the plague
CoV's belief in the stars gave a great opportunity to introduce a new HCOV.
In this case, the coV channel functions as the HCOV gene lung.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, a prophylaxis or loss of protein implantation gene has the potential to medify the phenotype of the virus dramatically.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in human adaptation due to the insulated SARS-CoV strain virus found to support the variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a special feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotides was found on a strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive change that supports the change in gear.
In addition, SARS-COV may have a history of recombination with alpha-COV and gamma-COV descendants, with a large number of smaller breeding areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
The recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of the various offspring was shown at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab novels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the recombination incident has also been observed in other HPVs where HCOV experiences recombination with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in undetected changes in the viral gene, which is likely to be caused by virus release from the current selection pressure, such as the immune system.
This effect is the loss of ORF4 complete on the HPOV-229E prototype strain as a result of the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed on the periphery virus and invertebrates with HCV-229E, alpha-coV alpha shows a single nucleotide component that causes random movement.
Finally, the new HCOV evolution was also excited by selective pressure in its reservoirs.
Symptoms light or undetected when coV is infected, which show each other adaptation between CoV and coV.
It seems that the eclipse fits well with CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, failure to activate the proinflammatory response to the pelvis will effectively lower the pathology of coV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell on the periphery is pressed because of the implementation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor regulation and the level of complex molecular expression of lower class I histocompatibility.
In addition, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) high from high cell metabolic activity can suppress coV replication and influence the correction by exoribonuclease to give selective pressure for the development of highly pathogenic virus strains when entering the new mucous membrane.
A more pathogenic COV strain may also develop through recombination, which causes protein perversion or new protein fibers to adapt.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two generations.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the tank, such as swelling and swelling.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where there's a secret killer without symptoms and the cause of a serious human infection.
Especially serious symptoms are due to excessive immune response activation and cytokine storms, with the most serious damage to the lungs if the immune response gets stronger.
On the other hand, the immune response to undetected symptoms has been reduced from the coV replication.
The same strategy to decide how immune response is related may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is particularly strong on the eclipse.
Therefore, the type I interferon supply, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
Inflammatory activation of the NLRP3 in a defective valve.
For this reason, the inflammatory inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 may benefit from the COVID-19 management.
Sars-CoV-2 chance followed the general age of Sars-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-coV-cows that share 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-Cows have been found, there are also coV-cows that share 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-Cov-2.
Although the hams and other animals in the market were found with a virus identical to SARS-CoV, no direct link to SARS-CoV-2 was found.
Beta-CoV is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 found, which shows that the fracture may act as one of the inter- or beta-coV distortions may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or unintentionally made by humans.
CoV's back to the center of attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 plague.
The CoV study in the vertebrates and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves for HCOV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 come from the periphery and are transmitted to humans through the intermediation.
Remember that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wetlands, maybe the closure of the wetlands and the killing of all wetlands in it that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the strains should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, since there are findings of several strains of beta-CoV strains that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans through the crackdown and other mothers still have to be explained in research in the coming time.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab ostrich for a long time.
It functions as an important means of transport and as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab island spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the eggs to control MERS, as in the wild animal market in Tigkok to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, a conscious approach must be made to develop a vaccine for effective ointments against MERS-CoV and combined with other infectious control steps.
Before we can remove this virus, new genotypes can develop and cause damage.
A variety of zoonotic coVs go into the wild.
In particular, the coV is very diverse with zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, which has brought about new coVs that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some places in Tigkok has to be left behind to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the preparation and planning of a better deposit should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet from time to time.
These viruses are in their natural reserve until there's a chance of preaching.
Although the ostrich has many features that support the spread of the virus, man’s contact with the ostrich and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Prejudice surveillance against mammals needs to be done to enhance the understanding of the coV ecology and its natural resources, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and the coming plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonose virus is for humans to keep the distance from the ecological reserviture of the zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the original zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First of all, if the tube transmits an external SARS-CoV-2 virus to the fracture, the condition when the tube and the fracture share the ecological relay is important to be known.
Second, if the eclipse has a more direct role in human transmission, the way in which humans communicate with the eclipse must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an intermarriage, the way it interacts with other species, which includes humans, the ear, and the tongue should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, have a good test infection and surveillance to do.
I don't know who's going out, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on?
In this area, research will reduce the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic update of "expected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a fast-track guidance for the diagnosis and management of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).
Even so, coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are being updated as well.
In this letter, we responded to one of our comments and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "probably" and "confirmed" based on the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Tigkok People's Republic.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused the disease, which is currently formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and that guide has been published in the Military Medical Research chain on February 6, 2020.
That direction has been of great interest since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Tingkok People's Republic (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has issued a total of seven editions with a large number of contexts.
Our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., and they introduced the offer of a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guidance and proved to be a valuable reference to this plague worldwide.
We supported their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude to Jehovah.
Even so, their work results also need to be updated based on the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a combination of one of the epidemiological narratives with two clinical manifestations is expected to be established in order to establish the case if there is no clear epidemiological narrative:
Epidemiological journals: (1) travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its districts, or other community in the case of COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the outbreak; (2) contact history in the case of a confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 (by positive nuclear asthma test); (3) contact stories in the patient who has had a fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and its area; or other community in the case of COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the outbreak; (4) contact stories with the confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases in the case of a female and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection titres; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, down, or decreases at the early stages.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case of pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) the real-time PCR positive test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire sequence through the virus shows high homogeneity for the new known coronavirus; (3) the positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or the change of the specific IgG specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibody from the negative becomes positive, or the titre increased ≥4 feet in the recovery phase at the level of the acute phase.
We can see that real-time nuclear PCR tests in the sample of a respiratory or blood supply are added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenetics on blood samples were added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on research into the evolution of researchers to find the optimal nitrogen detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood collection, which enhances the availability of various specimen, and supports the activation of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence to remind us to monitor patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
That's why Zhou et al's blood vessels need to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be checked in practice and in time for clinical studies.
As a cover, we expect more direct evidence to appear and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that we follow and follow up the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team would also update our direction over and over again as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day as a result of that virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported on the number of infectious cases that included 114 active cases and 33 healthy cases that lived at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In an emergency, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death involves four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was visited at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport said that public transport would be stopped longer than redesigned until Saturday arrived.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26th and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transporting the necessities of the tree -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on 8 March, on two new arrivals from Italy and one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronal virus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by a corona virus.
It happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered its first death related to the coronary virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from corona virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,056,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within two and a half hours of 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand corona virus cases, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News office reported, which reported Johns Hopkins University's data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by corona virus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, extended the area quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
Portugal's parliament has taken the vote to extend its national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was taken with 215 support, ten abstinence, and one voice refused.
The Saudis spent long hours in the holy city of Mecca and Medinah until the whole day; before that, only 3 o’clock in the evening and 6 o’clock in the morning.
Thailand plans to spend the night between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the residence order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia lower the purchase limit of toilet fabric per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth and Colleges each down the supply of toilet clothes to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one set, on Monday.
It was announced as a message in the box and on the Facebook page of the network.
Drivers are reported to be preparing for the fear of COVID-19 if the public must do the insulating.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilets for shipments to the house until one pack per consignment.
This change followed four packs of transactions previously applied to Woolworths and Colleges each on 4 and 5 March.
In his media statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the cancellation of those four bosses, "many stores still run out in an hour since the shipment," and called the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "inconceived".
The sale of "extensive" last week, according to one of the Woolworths jurors.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the number allowed up to two weeks ago.
To avoid arriving, Colleges ordered a bigger package than the cook and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made preparations for special hair promotion activities earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that peritel was trying to increase supplies, but the local government's limitations for the time of truck delivery made it difficult.
He expected to pay the production costs, while the cooks were trying to meet the request, and less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since the preparation had been completed earlier, some shops could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, director of the Queensland University of Technology, said the store is filling in every night's supplies.
He stressed that toilet fabric is large goods that are so low in supply and, if it's sold, make many empty spaces on the shelf so that things get more comfortable.
Coles and Woolworths think [that] if there are many things in the rack, if products like toilet and catering are able to [purchase] and there are in large numbers, panic may be minimized, russel Zimmerman expands through the ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of who gave a crap again was saying on the last Wednesday that they were out of gear.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Uncle Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to keep the market, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property vendors offer free toilet fabric to the first auctioneer in Melbourne, when less auctions are held because the buyer takes the engine for a long weekend vacation.
The issue of the NT News Chamber, a day printed in Darwin, outlined eight pages of silk that were meant to be cut and used as a toilet cloth.
The shops in general refused to apply the limit, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3, they said they did not plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, catering, dry food, soap, and carpets.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon, the British Ocado chain supermarket was observed to limit the purchase of Andres’s toilet to two packs of 12 gulls.
World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the COVID-19 plague is occurring—the disease caused by the coroner SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries still have the ability to change their journeys.
If the country detects, tests, manages, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, we'll find Theodore Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO.
We were very well cared for by the level of preaching and preaching activity and by the level of fearsome action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases, this was "before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no respiratory tract virus that has ever been tracked from its occurrence to global preaching that is alarming."
Ghebreyesus expressed the same view, saying, "We've never seen a panda that was pecked by a coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pancreas that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status was followed by the WHO decision in January, which declared the plague an insurmountable economic downturn that exacerbated the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "the plague is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reports at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemi coronavirus 2019-2020 is a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is ongoing and is caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The plague was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, as a World Health Organization (WHO) Resolution on 30 January 2020, and as a pharaoh on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people were healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tigkok, while the world's circle starts from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common fever involves fever, chills, and breathing.
Complication can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from dawn to sunset is usually about five days, but it can be crossed from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antiviral treatments.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive action that is recommended involves washing your hands, closing your mouth when you are pregnant, keeping the distance from others, and watching and standing in isolation for those who are expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to restrictions on travel, quarantine, nighttime, job risk management, and the closure of facilities.
This phenomenon has led to a serious social crisis in the global economy, a weakening or undermining of cultural, political, religious, social, social, and commercial sectors, and the spread of the distribution of goods that have been distributed with the purchase of panic.
Schools and universities have been well closed at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
The misinformation about this virus has spread wildly and there is an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against Tionghoa, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with a significant virus case.
As a result, travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution, and carbon emissions have dropped.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei Province), report on the pandemic cluster for unknown reasons on December 31, 2019, and conduct research in early January 2020.
These cases are largely related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has just been found and has been infected with the coronation virus, the coronavirus invertebrates, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms later fell ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the early case cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a relationship with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tiongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among those with smaller symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds under the age of 2,4% worldwide, estimated that 60% of the English population had to be infected before the group's inability to reach.
The case refers to the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and the results of the tests confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30, estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than that reported.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers recover.
For those who are not healed, the period from the onset of symptoms to the death of between 6 and 41 days, with at least 14 days in general.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In Tigkok, by February 5, about 80% of death occurred in elderly people over 60 years of age and 75% had previous health problems, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death accounts due to COVID-19 generally refer to people who have died giving a positive test for COVID according to official protocol.
The number of actual fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the official number probably does not distinguish people who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the count of official COVID deaths with factor 4-5 fold.
A woman juror speaks for the U.S. Control Centre and Disease Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by the non-intelligible report on the U.S. account too low. A too low count appears in the pandemic, such as in the 2009 swine flu epidemic H1N1. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death on the east side of Tigkok occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death on the east side of Asia was in France on February 14th.
By February 28, more than a hundred deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territorial regions have reported death, on every continent except Antarctica, and in general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies from region to region and from one time to another, and is affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first injury, and the characteristics of the population such as age, type of crime, and health as a whole. The cause of death reflects the number of deaths in a given time range.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the global case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) on 10 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region.
In Tiongkok, the death rate for the case fell from 17.3% (for people with symptoms of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other estimates include the number of fatalities (CFRs), reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed who died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities (IFRs), reflecting the percentage of people infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
This statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a certain population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the number of fatalities for pandemics as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limits on this estimate range from the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the impact of the assessment on CFR.
WHO points out that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peaks and the end of the plague are unclear and may vary according to the location.
Macijej Boni from Penn State University said: "Without control, the jaw usually grows deep and then begins to fall down when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable project at the moment about when it's happening."
Senior medical adviser to the government of Tingkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this plague may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilised to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to depart, possibly for one or two years."
According to Imperial College's research led by Neil Ferguson, physical discharge and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear completely" and this disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Relapse virulence will depend on the ability of the group and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and those infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry rock (68%).
A lack of common sense involves fatigue, production of respiratory spasms (flagma), loss of penicillin ability, breathing thirst, sleepiness, and muscles, headaches, headaches, seizures, vomiting, haemopticism, diarrhoea, or psychosis.
U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) reports an emergency symptoms that include respiratory problems, tightness or chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and excitement on the face and lips; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms occur. Further development of the disease can become severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be allergic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, the researchers suggest that those who are close to those who confirmed infection should be carefully monitored and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa people estimate that the symptoms range from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (when between infection and stroke) usually crosses between 1 and 14 days, at least 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who have lost their initial penance capacity 30%, and fall 15%.
The information on how to spread the disease is still being examined.
The preaching of COVID-19 is particularly assured at the time of close contact and through small droplets produced when walking, smiling, or talking; close contact is within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered rock could cause the droplets to move 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be triggered by a small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking.
The droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of someone who's close to him or may fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can change the respiratory secretion into aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also occur when someone touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the faeces, the risk is low.
The Tingkok government looks at the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 orally. The most common virus is in the first three days after the symptoms are resolved, although the ministry may happen before the signs are visible and at a later stage of disease.
People gave a positive test up to three days before the birth of a symptom, which indicates transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few reports of anatomical cases confirmed by the laboratory, but anatomical retrieval has been identified by some countries when investigating contacts.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) said that although it is not quite clear how easy this disease is to spread, one general person infected two to three others, and this virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and a 304-day stand on the card, and more than four hours on the bank.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can develop a virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have touched the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia-related patients in the acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All types of SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to coronavirus in the natural world. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if you have a built-in soap that develops its protective amp. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected to SARS-CoV at the beginning.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classified as Betacoronavirus, in the Sarbecovirus subgenus (the descendant of B) along with two galls of the offspring of the pelvis.
This virus has 96% equivalent to the whole level through another coronavirus sample (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, researchers in Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequence between the flu virus and the human virus.
So far, the overall comparison by finding the most common is 92% of the genetic similarity between coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that coronavirus-CoV-2 is interfering with SARS-CoV-2.
Infections by viruses can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but at last confirmations are done through the back-to-back polymerase response (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or through CT titration.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many features of titration that are resistant to pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT can't be used for screening or as the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-COV-2, first released on January 17.
Testing using real-time polymerase transcriptase response (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be made on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on the nasopharyngeal sepsis, but the sepsis sepsis can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serology tests proved sufficiently accurate to support its widespread use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been agreed for emergency use, only by a certified laboratory.
The characteristic features of computational radiography and tomography (CT) in people who are symptomatically involved in background glass peripheral resistance asymmetry and no pleural rash.
Italian Radiological Society is manipulating the international chain database for tracking confirmed cases.
Because it's thicker with other infections like adenovirus, titration without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in the COVID-19 identification.
A large study in Tigkok compares breast CT results to PCR and shows that although there is a lack of specific for infection, titration is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as an infestation device in the epidemic area.
The neural convolution network is based on artificial intelligence that has been developed to detect the fibrillation features of the virus with radiography and CT.
A strategy to prevent this disease involves keeping a good personal cleaning up, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using your clothes when it's dry or dry, and throwing your clothes directly to the trash.
People who may have been infected are recommended to wear a medical mask in public places.
It is also recommended to prevent reprisals.
However, the virus has reached the public scale in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who manage people who may be infected are recommended to perform standard prevention, prevent contact, and protect their eyes. Contact detection is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further recurrence.
The use of location data from a phone by the government for this purpose has led to privacy problems, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance ban.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or recommended to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on a private friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of user lines to other phones.
Furthermore, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, treating the nose and chewing on the stomach are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Cleansed hands are encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twelve seconds, especially after washing from the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after washing their nose, ankle, or linen.
It's because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a built-in soap that damaged its protective layers.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand screening with alcohol content of less than 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of channels (in one minute of the paparasal infection for hard rock surface), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Other routes, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are not effective.
CDC recommends that if there is expected or confirmed COVID case in general facilities, such as office or childcare facilities, all areas such as office, bathroom, general area, electronic devices together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferer should be disinfected.
Health - care organizations recommend that people close their mouths and noses with chewing gum or using the tissue when it is used or used in the skin, and then immediately remove the tissue.
Various masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because of the use of masks can limit the volume and the tempo droplet of the explosive that spreads when speaking, squeezing, and squeezing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with the hands that are not clean enough, which is a major source of recovery."The mask is also recommended to be used by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, although WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to induce the use of masks for members of society.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of a non-medicine face mask made of linen. Step aside specifically recommend the use of medical masks once used to healthy populations, especially when approaching (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommended a different type of mask when using public speaking or living in many places.
Thailand’s health officials encouraged people to make house - to - house jewelry and wash it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their people from going out to public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouth.
On March 16th, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a face mask while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has arranged for every person to enter the castle to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has been responsible for train passengers and interporters wearing facial masks on April 1st.
Panama owes the use of face masks every time out of the house, and recommends the construction of its own face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social circumcision (also called physical circumcision) is an act of controlling infections that are intended to slow down the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social separation methods include quarantine; travel; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply the method of social exclusion by living at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using uninvited greetings, and caring for the physical welfare of others.
At present, many governments are obliged to or have social exclusions in the affected areas.
The maximum number of people who are recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is reduced rapidly, starting from 250 people (if no COVID-19 is known in one area) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Lansia and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems with a higher risk of serious disease and complications recommended CDC for as much as possible in the home of areas with disabilities at the level of society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to change the term "social screening" as "physical screening", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relationships, either in terms of virtual or far-off terms.
The use of the term "social networking" has the effect that people must be totally socialally isolated and does not encourage people to stay in touch with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the period of the pandemic.
This recommendation includes the urge to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have a virus or a virus symptom.
Insulating at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those expected to be infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for the proper insulatory. Many governments are obliged to or recommend quarantine to the entire population living in the affected area.
The quarantine instructions are the most strict exits for people who include high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently moved to the country or territory with the extensive preaching of COVID-19 are encouraged to perform quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last partition.
The strategy in the control of the plague is rebellion or oppression, as well as mysticism.
Guides are carried out at an early stage and aim to track and isolate the infected and take other steps to control the infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the spread of the disease, try to further shift to a mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on the health and public health system.
A combination of supportive and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
Suprez needs more extreme steps to shift the pancreas by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the treatment of infectious diseases is an effort to lower the epidemiology peak, known as the epidemiology curve.
This lowers the risk of obesity in health care and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the scourge involves the prevention of individuals, such as cleaning of hands, wearing face masks, and quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical discharge, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; public engagement to stimulate reception and participation in such intervention; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning. Other actions are aimed at addressing the scourge in Tigko at a more real disaster, such as disrupting the entire city and treating the severe travel ban.
Other countries also apply various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass destruction and quarantine, as well as warning of the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected who make quarantines and wear large dens for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and penalises medical supplies. Simulations for England and the United States show that myigation (slow but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and depression (reducing the epidemic) has a major challenge.
The optimal mitigation policy can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and a dying health system.
Suction can be chosen, but it needs to be protected while the virus is still going on in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first one is achieved), because if not, the resurgence will be rescinded rapidly when the suppression steps are directed.
Long-term intervention to push the pancreas has a social and economic impact.
There is no specific anti-virus drug agreed to for COVID-19, but to develop, which includes existing drug testing.
Taking flu drugs that are sold free, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of obesity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can damage the patient’s condition.
Some of the lives previously agreed on for the treatment of other virus diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that some "traditional treatment and home" could rejuvenate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing the capacity and acceptance of health services for the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in the response of the disease.

There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of a new coronavirus can be found on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tigkok.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are largely related to the Great Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these species; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with unknown causes was observed on December 26 and handled by Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Hospital, which informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Hospital told their friends about "coronvirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police because of the spread of false disasters, and others, Ai Fen, were advised by him for the warning he was issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued a public announcement on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Quite a number of pneumonia cases are not known to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, who then conduct research in early January. At the beginning of the accident, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Tingkok provinces, supported by migration during the New Year's Imlek and because Wuhan is the center of transport and main railway transport.
On January 20, Tigkok reported on nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Because of the outbreaks in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area limit free movement and make border controls.
The national response involves measures such as quarantine (known as a residence permit, a place of refuge, or a neighborhood quarantine) and night hours. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in a type of quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million were in the Philippines, around 59 million were in the area in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were in the area in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a similar state of quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about as much as the world's population.

Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26, which was reported to the CDC Jianghan hospital on December 27.

Director-General WHO says that WHO "is very concerned about the level of preaching and awareness-raising that concerns, and about the level of action that concerns it."

A number of administrators of the province's Tiongkok Communist Party (CPC) have been suspended from handling a quarantine effort in the Central Tiongkok, which is a sign of discontent with the political responsibilities of the bank in dealing with the disease in that region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tingkok Xi Jinping from public anger related to coronavirus plague.
Several Tigkok officers, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior recognition of the early coronavirus disease in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory about COVID-19 from the US or Italy.
The U.S. government named coronavirus as "Tigkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "Tigkok's shut-down action gives power to the virus that is now becoming a global pandemic." This word was finally criticized by a number of critics as racists and "relieved the attention of his government's failure to deal with the corona virus."
The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that outlined a communication strategy and clearly came from the National Security Council, with a strategy called "All about Tiongkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows."Media, such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claims that Tigkok's attempt to send help to countries affected by the virus is part of the propaganda movement to affect the world.
Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warns that there are "geo-political components, which include fighting to get impact through the reversing of facts and "the policy of generosity."

The source charges Russia with a "geopolitical and diplomatic attack".
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi On Mayo ignored the media report and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent cargo vehicles with medical assistance to the United States.

On 14 March 2020, President of Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the plague because it lacked access to the international market as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The plague has prompted a call to the United States to adopt a general social policy in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family support, and higher education levels for public health.
Political analysis suggests that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's ability to re-elect in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea is devastating because of this pandemic.
South Korea criticises "the ambitious and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that every person coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a government-designed location.
At first, South Korea's views are divided by the response of President Moon Jae to this crisis.
Many of the people of Korea signed the petition, and called on the Moon, based on their claim about the government's failure to handle the matter, and praised its response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could enable the government to strengthen its power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree without a time limit, to suspend parliament and general elections, and to punish those considered to be spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus waves are blamed for the lack of supply, which comes from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the damage, purchases for panic, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Medical and Food Supervisory Body issued a warning about the lack of drugs and medical devices because it increased consumer demand and consumer interference.
Some areas have also experienced purchases because of a panic that results in the emptying of trees, such as food, toilet fabric, and bottled water, which trigger a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the transmission of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tetras Adhanom, the request for a protective device increased by 100 fold.
This request resulted in an increase in the price of up to twelve times the normal price and resulted in a four - to - six - month sale of medical supplies.
This has also led to a lack of self-defense throughout the world, and WHO warns that this will endanger health.
In Australia, the pancreas provided new opportunities for the buyers to sell Australia’s products in Tigkok.
This activity led to the arrival of milk formulas on some supermarkets and was finally banned by the Australian government. Following the high prevalence of the COVID-19 case in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the high demand for food, the two areas avoided the lack of food.
The steps taken by Tigkok and Italy in the fight against counterfeiting and trafficking of important products have succeeded so that the lack of acute food expected to occur in Europe and North America can be prevented.
North Italy, with its large number of poultry productions, has not yet experienced a pollination, but prices can increase according to industrial governance.
Empty foods were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, by a government official in Tiongkok to provide the basics of the society.
The same laws exist in Italy, which requires food producers to keep provisions for emergency situations like this.
The global economic crisis has been felt in Tiongkok: according to the media report on 16 March, the economy in Tiongkok was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of government's steps to prevent the spread of the virus, and the sales of the benchmarks total of 20.5%.
Because the bluetongue is the centre of the economy and large manufacturing, the virus plague is considered to pose a major threat of destabilization against the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economicist Intelligence Unit estimated that the market would remain jolted until there was a clearer picture of the potential of the end.
In January 2020, some analysts estimate that the impact of economic declines on global growth could exceed the SARS disaster in 2002-2004.
An estimate by a Washington University expert in St. Louis said the plague affected more than $300 billion in the world market chain, which could last up to two years.
The country's Earth Oil Export Organization (OPEC) is reported to be "reduced" after the Earth's oil price has suffered severe pollution due to reduced Tigkok's demand.
On February 24th, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside the Pacific.
On February 27, due to his increased concern about coronavirus diseases, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, have recorded the last recorded census since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest census ever since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices close the week with more than 10% pollination.
On February 28, Skopje Ratings GmbH emphasized the level of Tingkok government credit, but defended negative Outlook.

Many people think that economic recovery may happen.
The economy of Mohamed El-Erian commends the emergency of the central bank and the country of the right time.
The central bank reacts faster than they did in the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst sectors of the world's travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist sites, and the government's actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many companies cancelled flights because of little demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional company collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway stations have also been closed.
The epidemic is consistent with Chunyun, the main season of the trip related to the New Year's holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and district governments, including the New Year's Festival, and the private company was also in charge of closing shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s events and tourist destinations were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, towns, and districts of Tigkok, the authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are the result of 80% of the country's PDB and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong has increased disease management to the highest level and announced emergency conditions, closed school to Maret, and canceled the New Year's celebration.
Visits to Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
North American and Middle East explorers have had a 50-60% census.
This also resulted in a 33-43% census and a foot-and-mouth trip to the shopping mall in Maret compared to February.
The cost-centre operator around the world has taken additional steps, such as increased sanitation, thermal scanners to check the buyer's temperature, and program launching. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the resource generated by the pandemic can increase the number of people in extreme poverty in Latin America from 14 to 22 million compared to the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs during the Wuhan epidemic.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, coronavirus diseases can cause 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates to reach 32%. In India, the region's quarantine has caused tens of millions of migrant workers in India (paid through daily wages) to become unemployed. Survey by Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some job losses. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they were carried out in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of Maret's month, four million French workers were employed temporarily and 1 million British workers were assigned a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany were assigned short-term work schemes to government grants for their employees, called Kurzbeit.
Germany’s short - term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Around the world, the art and cultural heritage sector is affected by the pancreas, which has an impact on the organization and individual operations, both performed and performed.
Organisations of the arts and culture strive to support their high mission (often public) to give cultural heritage access to society, to the security of workers and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world, and at different levels, museums, libraries, exhibitions, and other cultural institutions were closed without a time limit, with exhibitions, events, and demonstrations cancelled or suspended.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, which have resulted in the loss of the latest disease and the rapid development of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and busanas.
The film industry was also disturbed by the Vatican's announcement that the Christmas festival in Rome, which fell in the last week's Christian Easter season, was canceled.
Many have encouraged the Christian age to live at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct radio, or television, while others offer drive-in or high school services.
With the closing of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and cleared it of the St. Peter's Land of Christian emperors, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restriction of public meetings in churches, churches, synagogues, churches, and churches.
Iran's health concerns announced a half-sacrifice in the affected areas and places of worship then closed, while Saudis forbid them from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
It has caused the most significant disturbances against the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or suspended, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 season NBA, and the 2019-2020 NHL.
This is a violation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that it will "be re-established until 2020, but will not be more than 2021."In the world, the casinos and other venues are closed and the poker tournaments are immediately closed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to a landfill, many gambling sites to report significant increases in their registration, and entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups lagging behind or canceling a concert tour.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also set up all the shows.
The artist explores various ways to continue to produce and share work through the internet as an alternative to the traditional direct display, such as the concert of direct broadcasts or making "festival" web-based for artists to view, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet’s network of coronal viruses has been distributed to many who turn to humor and turn their attention to the middle of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 plague was suspected, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Tinghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
An incident of fear, suspicion, and hatred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
A report from February (when most cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Tionghoa deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claim to be a similar reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people report discrimination because of their territory.
There's support for Tinghoa people, both wires and loops, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the plague to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious disease COVID-19, can also be a source of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first sign a petition to prevent Tighoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan train is on Twitter.
Tionghoa and other Asians in the UK and the United States reported an increase in racism and assault rates.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Tiongkok Virus", the term that critics considered racist and anti-Tiongkok.
The Russians in Ukraine attacked buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering with Tigkok, and learning in large cities in India were reported to experience a surge in the coronavirus plague.
The president of Bharatiya Janata's party, part of the country's Dilip Ghosh West Bank, said that Tigkok had destroyed nature and "that's why God avenges them."
The statement was then threatened by the Tigkok Consulate in Kolkata, calling it "kluru". In Tigkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tighoa peoples are evicted because of the plague, with foreigners being described as "foreigner" and targeted for "refoulement".
Many newspapers that use payment adjustments have removed them for part or all of their coronavirus leukemia.
Many scientists have made available access to open - air toilets for scientific reasons.

Laboratory tests for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and virus SARS-CoV-2 included a method that detects the presence of the virus and detects antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA SARS-COV-2 alone.
These tests are used to confirm new infections or are still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
The antibodies test shows the number of people who have been infected, including those who are too light to report or who have no symptoms.
The mortality rate of the exact disease and the degree of inability of the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited testing, by March 2020, there is no country with data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests carried out by countries.
This variability may also have a significant impact on the number of fatalities reported, which is likely to be too high in some countries.
Using a real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response chain, this test can be performed on a breathing sample obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal sampling or a spray sample.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests carried out on the spine can only be carried out on the first week of disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those infected on the second week, the sample material can be taken from the breathstream by using a catheter of the isap or the material released through the trunk (sputum) to be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using a real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus)-based authentication tool, which ran on 28 January 2020.
This device searches for the "E" gene of all coronavirus betas, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tingkok, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency consent from the National Medical Administration Tingkok for PCR-CoV-2 authentication tools. In the United States, the Control and Disease Prevention Centre (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version testing device provided results that were not convincing because of reaction errors, and the number of tests on the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in a decrease of 100 samples per day being processed during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered to be unrestricted until 28 February 2020, and only after that is the laboratory of the country and the local laboratory permitted to perform the tests.
This test was agreed by the United States Medical Supervisory and Food Agency on the basis of the U.S. Law Enforcement Authority. The US Commercial Laboratory began conducting an examination in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the provision of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 inspection available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No amount limits are announced; the collection and processing of specifics should be done according to the CDC specification.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Virological and Biotechnological Research Centre VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, that test was registered by the Federal Health Care Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation (U.S.A.) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using an isothermal nuclear amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of heat exchange cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott anticipates to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies specifically linked to the protein nucleocapid (protein N) of the new coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, with hope that it can produce results within 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza testing.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that "toraks photos have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, one of the CT [computed tomography] encounters may have existed before the symptoms were resolved."
The specific features of the CT include the background-glass polylobular resistance with peripheral, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura, paving madness, and consolidation are forms of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the starting point of the pandemic currently shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a lot of puncture features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT can't be used for the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for the initial placement.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care (PACT) test.
Automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on production levels for each system.
For CLTs, generally one peripheral blood specimen is used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, it's generally used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin tissue.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to the check. On 26 March 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 banks that provide the agency with information as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by the FDA for their test tools that detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in a blood sample.
Its testing capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the outbreak of infection, and early April, Raya discovered that not one of the antibodies bought was good enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme to allow the expected patient to live at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a special cage," they went into it, sent it back, and obtained the results of the test a few moments later. NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering the expected case testing scheme at home to eliminate the risk of patients coming to the hospital or should have an ambulance infection if used. In the high-end examination for the case expected COVID-19, a professional health force will take the appropriate preventive action.
At 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicals said that Germany had about 12,000 daily tests in road health care and 10,700 tests had been carried out last week.
Costs are incurred by health insurance if tests are requested by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
On March 19, a major test was offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/20 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technical and Rambam Hospital develop and test the method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the samples were found positive. In Wuhan, the laboratory of an emergency detection of almost 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: ↔, or "Api Mata" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being monitored by BGI Wang Jian and spending five days, the model shows that the Hubei case can be 47% higher and the cost of quarantine control can be doubled twice if the test capacity is not available.
Wuhan Laboratory immediately followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout Tigkok.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity of a total of 50,000 tests per day. The design of the open source multiples by the Assays Origami can test as many as 1.222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. This design can be performed in a small laboratory without the need for robotic cooling.
By the end of Maret’s month, the lack and lack of sufficient response have led to mass testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers are trying to explore sample storage protocols involving sample storage at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release via RNA for further testing. On 31 March, the Arab Union was reported to perform more coronavirus tests per capita compared to any country, and is preparing to increase the testing scale to reach most populations.
This was achieved through a combination of high-end testing and the purchase of a massive-scale laboratory of population from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory that has this scale out of Tigkok.
A variety of test recipes designed for the genetic profiles of coronavirus were developed in Tigkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test devices sent to low-level countries without the capacity to develop themselves.
German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until January 28 so that the tests available in the United States could be delayed. At the beginning of the war, Tigkok and U.S.A. had a problem with test equipment; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test equipment to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
Rather, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the use of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in the private sector lab, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow the increase in COVID-19. High demand for testing because of the widespread virus preaching caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for operations in the US private laboratory, and the supply of surgical equipment and chemical reactions became critical.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported on their test kits.
In the United States, CDC's built-in testing tools have "deficit"; the government then removes the bureaucracy barrier that prevents the public from testing. Spain purchases test tools from the Tigkok Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd company, but finds that the results are not accurate.
The company explained that false results may result from failure to collect samples or to use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish terminator said that they would attract the wrong result, and replace it with other testing tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok produced the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tiongkok that proved to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that the watercraft should be disposed of to the Danube River. The Kara's Ateş from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey's watercraft from Tigkok had "high error rate" and they didn't "use it". Raya bought 3.5 million watercraft from Tigkok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that it could not be used.
Tests, followed by the quarantine of people who tested positive and tracked people who were contacted with positive SARS-COV-2, resulted in a positive end.
Researchers working in the city of Vo Italia, the first location of death as a result of COVID-19 in Italy, did two rounds of tests on the entire population of over 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people who tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found in the quarantine.
With the ban on travel to this community, new infections were completely eliminated.
With aggressive contact, entry clearance, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has developed much more slowly than other developing countries, even without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and restaurants.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened exactly after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by seeking out aggressive contacts, travel bans, testing, and quarantine, but with non-aggressive regional quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatality, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive COVID-19 samples first and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 are in Australia.
In the following instance, the "Positive Result Test" column is affected by the country's policy of testing.
The country that only tests the patients in the hospital will have a percentage of positive results higher than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same other factor.
Wash your hands, which is also mentioned with a clean hand, is an act of cleansing someone’s hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganism, or other substances that are not desirable.
Wash your hands with soap consistently on certain "critical times" throughout the day prevent many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are pronounced through fecal-oral routes.
People may also be diagnosed with respiratory disease, such as influenza or stroke, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., facial membranes).
Five critical times during the most important day to wash your hands with soap are: before and after pouring out large water, after cleaning your child's ass or changing the pans, before eating, before eating, and after preparing food or eating meat, fish, or meat.
If there is no water or soap, your hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
Before, when, and after cooking.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing the chicken or cleaning the kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, lips, or lipstick.
After touching animals, food, or animal waste.
Medical clearance refers to practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacters, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the field of medicine, but it is also important for the general public.
Washing hands has many benefits for health, including minimalizing influenza, corona virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing depleted causes; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
The 2013 study shows that the practical increase in washing hands can slightly increase the growth of female children.
In developing countries, children’s mortality due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple measure can reduce mortality by up to 50%.
An intervention that promotes washing hands can reduce the case to about the same extent; it can be done by providing clean water in a low-level area.
48% of the cases in question can be related to washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ISPA), as a subconscious behavior in homes, schools, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, the main ISPA, is the cause of the death of a bile child; this disease causes about 1.8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets as an essential ingredient can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, and reduces death to almost half and death from acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Clean hands are usually combined with other sanitation activities as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Cleansing your hands also protects you from the impetigo caused by physical contact directly.
The small side effect of washing your hands is that washing your hands often can cause skin damage as a result of skin loss.
A study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive washing of hands could lead to skin rashes and rashes, known as hand rashes or hand dermatitis, especially many of which occur among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important for reducing pharynx, which is: before and after using toilets (small water, large water), after cleaning the baby's ass (sitting the pop), before washing the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or eating meat, fish, or meat.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing the right hand for preventing disease is before and after treatment of the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing the nose; after touching the animal’s dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that the rate of 38.7% of households to wash hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudis have a highest rate of 97 percent; the United States is almost mid-77 percent; and a drop at lowest rate of 23 percent. Now some behavioral methodologies are available to improve the adoption of washing hands with soap at critical times. Washing group hands at a time when students have been identified is one of the options in developing countries to wash their hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines, is an example of the right schooling to support children’s health and education.
It's twice a year, plus washing hands every day with soap and bonding teeth every day with fluoride, is the origin of this national program.
The program was also successful in Indonesia.
The micro-organism clearance from the skin is reinforced by an addition of soap or detonation to water.
The main task of soap and determination is to reduce the barrier to running and to improve the ability to drive.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleaning due to fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easy in the water.
In this way, fat and protein cleaning is helped by enough flow of water.
Fat soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain the bacteria that were previously used.
A small number of studies investigating the removal of the bacteria from the densely contaminated soap have concluded that the removal cannot occur because the bacteria are contaminated with the bus.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "The cheese that is released from the pot without touching the hands more like."
Anti-baker soap is greatly encouraged to a society that is conscious of health.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections recommended better for an antibiotic-resistant organism in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent, such as triclosane, which has a list of large-scale plant strains.
So even though the antibiotic - resistant alien is not targeted by an antibacterial soap, it may not be an effective one.
In addition to surfactants and skin protections, high formulations can contain asthma (ascetics, ascorbates, lactates) as pH adjustment, asthma benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditions (gastrointestinals, vitamins, mentols, and growth extracts).A comprehensible analysis from the University of Oregon’s Health Faculty of Health shows that common soap is as effective as an antibacterial soap that contains tricloses in preventing disease and cleaning the bacteria from the hand.
Hot water is comfortable to wash your hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more efficient than cold water is more efficient in eliminating natural oil that holds dirt and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that hot water use has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Manual or antiseptic monitoring is a cleaning agent that is not based on water.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, the cleaning of hands with non-water-based alcohol (also known as alcohol-based hand-sweeting, antiseptic hand-sweetting, or hand-sweeting) began to be known.
Most of this cleaning agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated together with adhesives such as Carbomer (acrylate starch polymer) to be gel or with humects such as glycerol to be liquids or buses for easy use and to reduce the effects of dehydration from alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide is an increase in antimicrobial activity further. Manual monitoring of at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient conservation killer.
Alcohol management has developed to kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and snakes.
Alcohol monitoring contains 70% of the alcohol killed 99.97% (log count 3.5, similar to 35 decibels) of the bacteria in 30 seconds after treatment and 99.99% to 99.999% (log count 4 to 5) of the bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after treatment.
Alcohol-based hand monitoring is almost completely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause for oral gastroenteritis. Antiseptic or alcohol-smoothing in the amount should be used to wash or to cover two hands completely.
The front and back two hands and on the edges and the ends of all fingers are heated about 30 seconds to the liquid, bus, or dry gel.
The edge of the finger should also be thoroughly washed by squeezing it in two arms. The Control and Prevention Centre of the U.S. Disease recommends the washing of the hands rather than the monitoring of the hands, especially when the hands are dirty.
Increased use of the search agent because of the ease of use and quick-activities of killing against the micro-organism; however, the search agent should not be used as a replacement for the correct hands, unless soap and water are available.
The use of alcohol-based monitoring hands can often cause skin to dry, unless the emolein and/or cause skin is added to the formula.
The effect of reducing alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerolin and/or other emoleins to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based monitoring of the hand with emolin has led to irritation and skin weakness far lower than soap and antimicrobial disorders.
Dermatitis allergic contact, urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or adjectives in the hands of alcohol rarely occurs.
Lowering the tendency to touch the dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of this product is compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't wash their hands of organic matter, but only disinfection.
For this reason, cleaning the hands of soap and water to prevent many pathogens is still in the hands.
The honesty of the alcohol - free pursuit depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse off than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzoalconium chloride have been proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after clothing, not like alcohol, which has been shown to be reduced after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many people in the low - income community were unable to buy soap and use it as a substitute for ashes or land.
Abus or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with micro-organisms, soils or ashes might increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, gray forms the alkaline route.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Technique washes right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Centre for disease prevention includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
The water is recommended to treat a bashcom that may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature seems to have no effect.
Put your hand around it with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under my feet.
Sabuno raised a mane from the skin, and the study showed that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Roasting creates pressure, which helps to remove the rubber from the skin, and excavating longer removes more copper.
It's just under the water.
Getting into the basketball can make your hands contaminated again.
Swim with a wet patch or let the wetting in the air.
Wet hands and thighs are more likely to be contaminated, often passing through areas such as mowers, armrests, area between the fingers, and beneath the ankles.
The built-in claws and the built-in claws can store micro-organisms.
The lotion is often recommended to keep your hands off; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection respiration.
A number of low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands when the water is dry and/or the soap is not available, for example, to draw water from a cherries or bottles hung and used as a grey, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where the water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there is a solution to the water problem, such as tippy-taps, and other low-cost options.
Tippy core is a simple technology that uses a water bottle that depends on the rope, an egg that is operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and some soap.
Handshake is an important part of the cleaning process, but there is a debate about the form of the most effective handshake in the public toilet.
More research shows that the paper sheet is much cleaner than the electric hand-helds found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and by the European paper sheet industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of paper sheet cleaning, hot air handling, and air handling of more modern jets.
After washing and washing hands with hot air heaters, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the outpouring of the hands.
Motivation with jet air heaters causes the total number of bacteria to rise by 42% in the fingerbooks and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and washing hands with paper sheet, the total number of bacteria is reduced by 76% in the fingerbooks and 77% in the hands. Scientists also do tests to determine the potential for waste contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of cooling method.
The jet air heater, which pumps air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow micro-organisms out of the hand and unit and potentially pollute the users of other toilets and the toilet environment up to 2 metres.
The use of hot air towing is spreading micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the towing.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, a number of methods for hand loss were evaluated.
After manual deceleration, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There were many hand milling machines, and the hand mill was compared to a hand mill using a paper sheet.
Washing your hands using the washing cloth is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based monitoring should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical treatment was required long after Hungaria physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effect (in 1846) in preventing disease in the area of the hospital.
There's an electronic device that provides a pen back to remind the hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection fell with the use of those devices.
Medical hands washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in large numbers or gels to warm and shake each part of the hand.
Hands must be burned together with the fingers tied together.
If there's dirt under my leg, the hair can be used to erase it.
Because man can survive in the water that is in his hand, his hands need to be washed thoroughly and he needs to be washed with a clean sheet.
After we dry, the paper sheet was used to kill the water supply (and to open the exit door if necessary).
This action avoids hand retaliating from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care care is to remove pathogen microorganism ("human") and avoid its predators.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that at least the handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical areas, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so that they develop microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures could lower the blood flow rate of up to 66 percent.
The idea of a clean hand WHO can also be seen on its website for public comments.
A relevant target by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can be measured and validated by hand cleaning if compliance with the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Lima Time" to wash hands:
After being exposed to blood/staining the body
before the aseptic task, and
After patient treatment. The metabolism of antiseptic chemicals into soap (or antimicrobial) works to kill the handwashing agents.
The kill function may be desired before or in a situation where an antibiotic-resistant organism is very sensitive. For 'smoothing' hands before surgery, it is necessary that the anger can be detected and killed without touching, chlorhexidine dust or iodium, sterile leaf to wash hands after washing, and sterile stobes and other sterile tools to clean the feet.
All the jewels have to be released.
This procedure indicates the washing of hands and hands down to the neck, usually between 2 and 6 minutes.
No time is needed for the long siege (10 minutes).
When boiling, the water in the lower arm must be shaken so that it does not return to the hand.
After the washing of the hands, the hands were softened with sterile linen and a different garment.
To reduce the amount of time you spend in the ministry, you might want to wash your hands or use your hands before and after handling the sick.
To control the infection of staphylococcus in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit was cleaning the hands from the first 20% washing, and that the extra benefit was very little when the hand cleaning rate was increased by 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the healing of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Consistency between washing hands with alcohol-based route and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand-washing reduces the contamination of bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand-switching to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores than hard hands. Intervention to improve the cleaning of hands in health care can include education for the cleaning of hands, increased availability of alcohol-based hand-switching, and written reminders and letters to the staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least some water supplies, such as soap, or washing facilities in the homes, schools, and workplaces make it a challenge to achieve the universal washing of hands.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing near private toilets or general toilets is seldom available, although options are available to create cheap washing facilities.
In any case, a lower level of washing can also occur because of a habit that has been planted rather than because of a lack of soap or water.
The urge and the urge to wash hands with soap can affect political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
To walk effectively, monitoring and evaluation is needed.
A systematic approach to 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to washing hands in LMIC, while social inclusion campaigns were not effective. One example of washing hands in school is the UNICEF's "Third Star Approach" which stimulates school to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that the students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning conditions.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to three stars.
Building a washing site can be part of a washing campaign to reduce the disease and death of the child.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign that attempts to achieve the purpose of change in behavior. As a result of the coronation virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washing emotions.
Some studies examine the cost-effectiveness of washing hands in whole countries developed in relation to disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the years that have been lost due to illness.
One innovation shows that promoting soap-washing significantly lowers the cost of water intervention and other sanitation.
It's important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a state of emergency, such as the mother who was born or the wounded soldier in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two half-yearly cleaning of her hands: Dr. Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the modern care centre" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infections are caused by the smells of an ash or bad air.
In the 1980s, the disease caused by food and infections related to health care made the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre more active as an important way to prevent infection.
The 2009 and 2020 COVID-19 flu wave will increase the awareness in many countries. It will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from that deadly disease.
For example, the poster "technique washes right hands" is hung next to the washbasin in public toilets and in the office and airport toilets in Germany.
The expression "cleaning your hands" means that someone's ability to take responsibility for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from a Bible passage in Matthew’s Gospel when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on a decision to betray Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Mephibosheth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands constantly to clean up the imaginary nodes; an act that showed her guilt for the crime she committed and for having seduced her husband to do so.
It has also been noted that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the washing of their hands.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after the meditation have a smaller possibility of being involved in a "cleaning" compensation action, such as volunteering.
The religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but without soap to wash their hands, is a ritual part of washing their hands in many religions, including the Bahá'i, Hindu faith, fasting and unlawful Yaadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. The teaching also commands the washing of hands to purify, especially after certain acts.
The Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions were obliged to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam were required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Workspace hazard management for COVID-19
The risk management of the workplace for COVID-19 is the prevention of safety methodology and occupational health for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Risk management at the right place of work depends on the workplace and the job, based on the risk analysis of a peer source, the rate of disease in the society, and the risk factor for each worker who may have a reduced COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Agency for Safety and Health at Work (OSHA), low-risk work has a minimal contact with the public and other workmates; for this work, basic prevention steps, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and cleaning and routinely infected working environments.
Patriarchal risk work is covering work that needs close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected because of an inoculation in an ongoing society or international journey.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public, such as at school, working environments with high population density, and high volume retellers.
Risk management for this group, besides basic prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency airflows, protection against noise, and providing self-protection tools when meeting with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and physical capacity of the known person or expected to suffer from COVID-19 at high risk, which increases the risk of a very high level of death if the worker does the aerosol performance process on, or takes or manages specifics of, the known person or expected to suffer COVID-19.
Dangerous management for this worker involves technical control, such as a negative ventilation room, and self - protective tools that fit the job.
COVID-19 can have some effects on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of the possibility of paternity.
The fields of commerce change, whether they are in the form of goods which they are asked to obtain, or whether they are in the form of merchandise.
Finally, shipments of goods from a highly affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Susceptibility and disease management plan can be used to guide protection actions.
The article considers the level of risks associated with various jobs and jobs, including peer-sources, risk factors arising from household and public administrations, and risk factors for each employee, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also outlined the risks involved and the emergency plan for situations that might arise as a result of the plague.
Sickness and planning may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the transfer involves lowering the gap between staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising bad effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The level of disease in the local business community is affected by the illegal activity taken.
Hazard management surgeons are a broad range of workplaces used in the safety and health of their work to avoid risk management based on its efficiency.
When the COVID-19 hazard cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-protection device.
Technical management involves insulating employees from the risks associated with work without relying on the worker’s behavior and being the most expensive solution to the cost of implementation.
Administrative management is an adjustment to the policies or procedures of the workforce or the employer.
Self - protection tools (APDs) are considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent most pests.
All types of APD should be selected based on the risk to the worker, correctly installed as they occur (e.g., the respiratory system), consistently and correctly tested, treated, and sometimes replaced, if necessary, and then cleaned, and stored correctly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Agency for Safety and Health at Work (OSHA), low - risk work has a minimal contact with the public and other workmates.
Steps to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces, including frequent washing of hands, stimulate workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics includes covering the ground and sinks, providing nets and garbage, preparing work from a long distance or working with the time/time of arrival, if necessary, telling workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and doing cleaning and disinfection of the working environment regularly.
Rapid identification and isolation of potential breeders are important steps in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a medication or other symptoms, and that the health care policy be flexible so that workers can stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to the OSHA, paternity risk work is covering work that needs close contact or often in six feet (1.8 m) with an unknown person or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the population's involvement in the business location, or because of someone's new international journey to the location with extensive COVID-19.
This group includes workers who have contacts with general society such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retrieval. Technical management for this group and high-risk groups includes installing high-risk air filter high efficiency, increasing the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as leaking plastics, and installing the drive-thru or stand-alone windows for customer service. Administrative control for this group and high-risk groups stimulates sick workers to live at home, converting face-to-faces with virtual communication, making working cycles with time to arrive/permanent, stopping non-essential travel to the locality which is taking place at the turn-to-to-end check-and-to-control, developing a control and control-to-control communication plan for control and control control, control-to-control and control-control-to-control, control and control-control-to-control, control and control-control-to-control and control-control-control-to-control-control, control and control-control-to-to-to-to-control, control and control and control-control-to-to-to-to-to-to-control and control and control-to-to-control and control.
The workers in this risk group rarely need a breather.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers involves separating the sick from the other person with six feet long, pointing out a cabin driver to take care of the sick, and offering a mask of face to the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cloth when he or she is sneezing or sneezing.
You're gonna have to wear a medical handkerchief once when you're caring for a sick passenger or touching a leak of the body or a potentially contaminated surface and maybe another protective device if a sick passenger is suffering from a fever, a persistent storm, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial voyages, including passenger ships and other passengers, hazardous management involves a journey in case of illness, isolation, and information about the medical centre on board the ship immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board the ship.
Ideally, there is no further medical treatment in the cabins of people who are isolated. After preaching to the public, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a community response at minimum levels until now, the social exclusion strategy can be applied, which includes: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice classes, or food at the cafeteria, increase the distance between tables, time and ongoing events, limit non-essential visits, and use separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there are high scores in local society, alongside the social exclusion strategy, the length of school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, the health risk is considered to be lower by CDC.
Law enforcement officer who has to contact a confirmed person or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If a close contact occurs during arrest, the worker must clean up and disinfect the pockets and tasks before being used again by using a spray or a ladder cleaning sheet and following the standard operation procedure to control and remove a former APD and to control and clean clean clean clothes.
OSHA considers the health and safety of certain bodies to be a category of high - risk or very high risk.
The high-risk job includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport that appears to be known to patients known to be or expected to be COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk of paternity if the worker does the aerosol production process on, or takes or manages the specifics of, a patient known or expected to COVID-19.
The aerosol procedure involves intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The work of the body room is at risk of high parity involving workers involved in preparing the body of the known person or expected to be COVID-19 at the time of death; this job becomes at a very high risk if the worker does an autopsy. Additional technical management for this risk group includes an insulating space for the patient known or expected COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is performed.
Special pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care centers and in the body.
The specimens should be handled by a Level of Biosafety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to a different waiting room should be separated if they are expected to be COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respiratory respirators for those who work in 6-foot of the known patient or who are expected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform the aerosol procedure.
In the U.S., N95-approved or better NIOSH-based face-up respiratory system should be used in the context of a written and understandable breathing protection program that includes appropriate testing, training, and medical examination.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covered clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not triggered by body fluids.
WHO'S just recommending a different mask for a scratch officer at the entry point.
For people who take breathing specs, care, or drive a COVID-19 patient without aerosol delivery procedure, WHO recommends different masks, protective glasses, or face scars, clothes, and gloves.
If the aerosol source procedure is performed, the different masks are replaced by the N95 or FFP2.
Remember that APD sales are not enough worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing APD's needs through long-range medical services, physical distributors such as visionary windows, with only people involved in direct care can enter the room with COVID-19, use only APD required for certain tasks, continue using the same respiratory system without leaving it when treating a lot of patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and orbiting the APD range, and does not induce the use of masks for undetected people.

BARIS SUBJAK: [Covid-19] ease the burden and prepare for the future
LANGUAGE/UNEMPLOYMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes the global human relationship and the responsibility we have for each other clear.
We've never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our workmates through e-mails, calls, and talks is an extraordinary validation of people, which we are quite lucky enough to work with them.
Thank you and my unmistakable pride can sometimes call you a workmate.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
They remind me of what it means for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain open to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, or you make sure this site keeps running, helps pay our friends, or helps to maintain our community's security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially at the moment.
It's a moment when not only do we do the job we do, but the way we do it, it's going to make a difference to the world.
Because the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization alive during this time.
We want to remove the pressure and support our long - term mission.
If you need to reduce the schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our day - to - day work is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and by the way you need to take care of your loved one, shopping for the needs of the trees, or going to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not watching your work.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should not be said, but we did.
Sickness box or PTO not needed, enough to let your manager and your team help review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from the manager).
The people whose wages are based on hours will be paid in full.
We've said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to the contractor's team and hour-based staff.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their employment as a way to cope with the stress of the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There's a few jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and the Data Recovery Team, among other things, do important work that may need additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to evaluate the current purpose and shift our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
It's gonna be okay for the future.
We don't plan on "sweet work" after this panda's passing.
You're not going to be expected to work on a bull to fill a date that is not realistic right now.
We realized that the situation had changed and would try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adapt to the new reality and to the expectations of working hours, we meant to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Year 2020-2021.
Our purpose is to promote the extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which allows more time to estimate so that employees can prioritize important work, care, and care of their loved ones as they need or want to work with the schedule less for a few weeks ahead.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We'll present our proposals to the House next week and update the delegations and teams in the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you, APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, Map, and Office Cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our friends based on the SF might have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, because of our anxiety, we hired anti-virus cleaning crew to infect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use the antivirus leaks across the hospital to infect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
Buildings apply the safety protocol of their own by using products that support the safety of their passengers.
We're happy that the office will be ready when we decide to go back.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office moved to a long, long - term job assignment, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our friends at NYC know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it is likely to be suspended.
Some of our colleagues worked far away for the first time.
Our longtime colleagues have long worked long enough to realize that it may need adjustment and they want to advise you:
The maximum duration is one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Make clear the details, make the schedule, and send out Bible literature before it is too late.
Make video as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Guide the leaders to facilitate each other, someone to watch a conversation for questions and to record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a close note (or make a collaborative note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remoteries channel in Slack to talk to friends about the work shared
The SDM Operation Team is looking for web-based ergonomic guidance to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout the Yayasan.
Last week we asked all the recipients of the money to move the community to cancel the public event on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO said it was over.
We tell them that we understand our request for abortion and other banishments that can make them unable to complete the activities agreed upon and that no one will be given a patent because of the delay or modification of the target.
This week we're going to follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and the conference of the regional and other thematic communities.
In general, feelings from the entire global community seem to be the result of this disturbance, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a website in Meta-Wiki to provide a room for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Kamis to come, at 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT for special staff.
We'll use this time to distribute extra updates, answer your questions, and take time for each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help our ass.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep updating this page and making sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have a question about travel, events, main working hours, or problems with a hug, or other matters that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be connected to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judah, Global SDM International Operations Director.
There is no such change as our secular work or our secular work.
Rather, it is an admission that, at present, our work and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and provide the world of service that they provide.
The work we're planning on is going to be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and maybe a few months ahead.
We need you all to make it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work well when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

B'Enzym angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme placed on the outside of the cell surface in the lungs, arteries, heart, glands, and use.
ACE2 has an activity that is resistant to angiotensin-II (ACE), with reduced angiotensin-II levels and increased angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also works as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 versions of humans are often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 angiotensin 2 enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains a vein that is placed on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a domain M2 of terminal-N peptidease and a domain of amino renin terminal-C collectin.
ACE2 is a single type I passenger membrane protein, with an active enzyme-visible domain on the cell surface of the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extractal domain is separated from the transambled domain by another enzyme, known as sedase, and the secret protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is in a large part of the body: ACE2 is placed on the membranes of the most common alveolar cell type II, low-use enterositis, endothelial blood cells and veins, and muscle polos of the artery in a large part of the body.
MRNA ACE2 is also found in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is the ACE balance sheet.
ACE breaks angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino phenylalanine terminal carboxylic acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its ohydrolysis into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides include [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dimorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also organized a series of nitrogen carrier membranes of neutral amino SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the main point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein to the spike or sars-coV and sars-coV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endotoxicity and viral and enzyme translocation into the endosum contained in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires primary protein S by TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This makes people hypothesis that the ACE2 layer in the cell may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend further ACE and standard ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis study, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors results in a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of an ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less severe than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it appears to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipolysaccharides.
The half-life of RACE2 on humans is approximately 10 hours with 30 minutes of rest except for 24 hours of effect.
Some findings indicate that rACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitor or angiotensin II disease in an increased blood circulation. RACE2 infusion has been evaluated in a clinical trial for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application that is designed to help you locate contacts to access the 2019-2020 panda of coronavirus, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contact") that may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or developed, with official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some work packs have been created to build up contact tracking applications.
The issue of privacy was asked, especially regarding the system based on the location of the application user geography.
Alternatives that don't have too much privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has disseminated applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID-19 suffering.
This application is used in more than 200 Tingkok cities. In Singapore, it uses TraceTogether applications.
This application is being developed by the local IT community, it will be released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launches "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track parasites against those who have the potential for infection and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application is being developed by means of communication, technology, and health care.
By April 14, 2020, the app is still waiting for the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store agreement.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking application was in the process of further development and would be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications were planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means introducing geophencing applications for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of less effectiveness if the data collected is limited to only a small part of the population.
To overcome concerns about the preaching of the "coronvirus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add the related coronvirus application to the App Store, which is limited only to "resmi" or that has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply a similar setback.
Privatists express their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
This organization has eight requirements for government projects:
surveillance must "according to the law, needs, and proportions";
surveillance and surveillance needs to have a solar claustro;
use of data must be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and proved on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalisation;
each division of data with a third party shall be defined in the laws;
there shall be protection against abuse and the right of nationals to respond to abuse;
partitioning means all my "relevant stakeholders", which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also output a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple article means to deal with surveillance problems further by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based, non-application tracking, thus eliminating the need to ignore applications and capabilities to avoid detection.
In Israel, a chain - based survey was agreed upon.
A network-based solution that has access to home location data has the potential of significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server for communication (see below).
In South Korea, non-application systems are used to monitor contacts.
As a substitute for a specific application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes data scan of mobile devices and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to people with infection potential.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes the information available to the public, which is permitted by wide changes to the information privacy laws after the MERS was set up in that country.
This information is available to the general public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using the system as a private protection system.
By 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been written.
Finding a contact that protects privacy is a concept that has already been mapled, with a large number of research literature beginning in 2013 at least. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts working on a private friendship solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's approach to other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is an attempt to coordinate which has a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Decentralization of the Approach that Protects the Privacy of Terdecentralization (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and the Personal Sensitivity Mechanism for the Secure Contact (PACT), and so on.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified has never left the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Private Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or age-intersection data to track the COVID-19 preaching.
This is based on a study from the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" in March 2020.Another similar feature is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was originally built in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and data with other users and officials without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups that have the same approach as the most complex protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key element in achieving a wide reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that manages Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to explore contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the intellectual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
tool launch to allow governments to make official applications tracking coronavirus that protect privacy
the integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to deal with data collection and surveillance problems and continue to distribute the system initially through the upgrade of the operating system, and then eliminate it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Repositories (also called new purpose, new profile, or new task on drugs or replacement therapy) are the agreed use of drugs for new treatment purposes, i.e. for disease or different medical conditions with the original purpose of drug development.
This route is a scientific course currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Another study included the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding binding sites.
Analysis of these connective sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral drug development project against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 proteins are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A A, et al examines some of the candidates' lives that were then optimized and analyzed to reconcile with the agreed drug and to have the highest stimuli to speed up the development of anti-SARS-COV-2 potent drugs in its preclinical study to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.

The doctor said they used that drug when there was no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with bed, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The New Langone Medical School is conducting a safety test and prevention testing of hydroxychloroquine.
Tingkok clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir has been shown to be "effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received faviravir and half of them received omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy reminded the public that the evidence to support the drug was not much and too much.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for preparation and use the military to send the medicine to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

This medicine may not be safe when used by a pregnant mother or someone who is trying to provide it.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no benefit to be feared".
This drug is designed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to medify the drug to find a life that will be associated with SARS-CoV-2.There are criticisms in the scientific community about the resource guidance for drug repositioning specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidaritas test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antivirus activity in vitro against some philos, pneumo, paramicos, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmissions.
Some initial trials show that remdesivir may have a high genetic setback against resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials performed by Cleveland University Hospital Hospital, one for people with disease and one for those with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials going on for intravenous vitamin C for people treated with IVID-19 and severe COVID-19, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tigkok, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State started testing for azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin is a low - molecular agent that is widely used to treat patients so that the Italian Medical Body can publish instructions on how to use it.
A multi-site study in 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at a prophylaxis and therapeutic dose was published in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention has been focused on giving the purpose of new treatment to the approved antiviral medicine and developed for previous diseases, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the opinion of the 7th edition.
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the opinion of the 7th edition.
Some antibiotics identified are potential as drugs that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): Agreed by Tiongkok.
In addition, try tests in Italy and Tigkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaccin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine to complete clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, this causative virus will not be available within 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were studying the safety of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great wave spread worldwide in 2020, which resulted in large investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
A lot of organizations use the videos published to develop vaccines that may fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative stated in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is the speed, production capacity, the preaching on the scale needed, and global access.
In April, the CEPI pilot reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform that has advanced to Phase I security study, including:
nucleate asthma (DNA and RNA) (phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I booster and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered being planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests performed the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed on a random basis, placebo-controlled, and at some locations, as well as the determination of a more accurate effective dose.
The Phase III test usually involves more players, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 are not yet in the human evaluation (still in the "proxy" research).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University in Australia announced that they are investigating the potential of a molecular receptor vaccine that will genetically medify the virus protein to trigger immune reactions.

On March 10, 2020, the Biosolutions Emergency announced that they worked together with Novax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
In addition, this confusion exacerbated the phase I clinical trial plan in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Agency announced that 11 isolates are operating, and even on a fast track, the development of vaccines at least takes about one and a half years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of particles like coronavirus with partial substitution from Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
These vaccines are being studied in the laboratory, with tests on humans planned in July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered ''a large sum of money' for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccines' to CureVac, which was defended by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced interference with German company BioNTech to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in a preclinical test with clinical trials expected to start in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive a preclinical test in April 2020 and that the candidate for the vaccine in the final stage could start testing people in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Innovation Coalition of Epidemi Kesiapsigung Epidemi (CEPI) announced an investment total of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total ECI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Another ECI investment fund for the development of COVID-19 vaccines is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian Health Office announced that scientists had begun testing six candidates for vaccines on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing RNA vaccines that can amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days after receiving a sample from Tigkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a total of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects on COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.

On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical Faculty reported an examination of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in a rat; they said that "MNA that gave the vaccine subunit S1 SARS-COV-2 induces a specific antigen-specific antibody response that can [in rats] start to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriofag, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce non-hazardous-like particles, which can inhibit the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered the resources to access IBM's supercomputer, combined with the resources of cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that these vaccines can benefit from outside the disease.
A further test in Australia attempted to follow 4,170 health - care officers.
There is a chance that the vaccine in the development will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate vaccine clearance using a specific model of COVID-19 animals, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, show the need to take steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure the standard safety procedure.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on a nonhuman animal model.
By 2020, there was no protection medicine or vaccine for SARS that proved safe and effective for humans.
The research published in 2005 and 2006 showed that the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health institutions around the world. In addition, the vaccine proved to be not yet available for MERS.
When MERS is a prevalence, there are certain SARS studies that can be useful for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completes phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all being a virus vector, two adenovirus vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media's postulates conspiracy theory that claims viruses behind the COVID-19 have previously been identified and that the vaccine has been available.
The patents covered by various social media items refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus gallus, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a malignant disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common fever involves fever, chills, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle nerves, diarrhoea, convulsions, loss of pen strength, and stomach pain.
The time from dawn to sunset is usually about five days, but it can be crossed from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some have developed to develop virus pneumonia and have failed to control organs.
By April 17, 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. This virus mainly spreads intermarriage when a close contact occurs, often through small cracks or droplets caused by rock, rock, sand, or when talking.
Even when it comes to breathing, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and not to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very rare for the first three days after a symptoms interruption, although it may occur before symptoms occur and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the real-time polymerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR) to the nasofaring phase.
The use of masks is recommended for those who are expected to be infected with the virus and those who care for it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and others continue their use.
Currently, there are no vaccines or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
The transmission of local diseases has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with the virus can have no symptoms or experience such symptoms as flu, such as fever, hail, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, hives or perplexing chests, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and face or voice of joy; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as dizziness, anxiety, or aches and pains, can be found, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in the early Tiongkok were only with a clinical picture of a broken chest and palpitation.
In some cases, disease can develop into pneumonia, an organ failure, and death.
It's called incubation time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can cross from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those infected will experience symptoms in 11.5% of the day, and the report shows that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of a pilot without these symptoms is not yet fully known; however, early evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is not yet known and are being investigated, with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Centre (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases confirmed remain undetected during hospital visits.
Tigkok National Health Commission began to comment on the case without symptoms in its case on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and running water can carry the virus load on a large scale.
Talking louder lets out more cracks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered rock could cause the droplets to move up to 4.5 feet (15 m).
Although this virus is not usually caused by air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors placed in a hallway outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as the intubation and resuscitation of the lungs (RJP), can transform the respiratory secretion into aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the fesces, the risk is low, the virus is the most effective when people walk; although the ministry may happen before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) said that although it is not quite clear how easy this disease is to spread, one common person infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cartons/cards, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and hard steels (AISI 304), and up to four hours on a 99% medium.
However, this varies according to color and temperature.
soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products decompose the protective layer of virus, deactivation of the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another route, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (suspension infection), is not effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of lignite were taken in the median two days after treatment was started.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load at the second day's test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to acute respiratory disease clusters in Wuhan.
All the features of the SARS-COV-2 virus are on a coronavirus that's wound up in the natural world.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by a step-by-step soap that damaged its protective membranes.
The lungs are the most affected organ of the COVID-19 because the virus accesses the honey cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most prevalent in the alveolar type II cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the brain cells.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of the infected people who were treated in the Uuhan, Tigkok, and more often in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbance during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with an ACE2 receptor in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in the heart function.
An incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infected patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopy to those who died because COVID-19 found a loss of peripheral alveolar (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithelium of the respiratory tract that expresses ACE2, COPID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, the T-cells that re-circulated GM-CSF pathogens have been shown to be consistent with the monosites that re-circulate IL-6 inflammatory and mild pathology severe in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphosytic infiltrates have also been reported in surgery.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase transcription chain reaction behind real-time (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on a breathing sample obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal valve; however, the nasopharyngeal or sputum samples may also be used.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but you need two samples of blood taken in two weeks to produce a small amount of time.
Tingkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus gallium and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction tests to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibiotic test (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously been infected) was under development but not widely used.
Tingkok’s experience with the test showed that it was only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. A diagnostic guide by the Zhongnan University Hospital Wuhan suggested a method to detect infections based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
The background-glass multilobar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and later many found at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural dominance, paving crazy (suppression of the seven workings with variation in alveolars), and consolidation can occur as a result of disease development.
A little data is available on microscopic lesion and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathology finding on the autopsy is:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, mild consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be treated:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumonia hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltrates, and the determination of a large number of giant cells
Pneumonia severe: loss of diffuse alveolar (DAD) with diffuse alveolar rash.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the recovery phase: exuberance of the alveolar horn and interstitial fibrosis lunger
Blood: intravascular coagulation is eliminated (DIC); leukoerthroplastic reactions
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding places of many, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC is recommended to close the mouth and nose with the tissue when it is soft or soft and recommend the use of the part in the tissue if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene’s proper hands were either carved or painted.
The CDC recommends the use of a cover cover from a public place, some of which restricts travel by unaccompanied people. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, by closing schools and jobs, by reducing travel restrictions, and by canceling a large meeting in public places.
The baptismal instructions also include the maintenance of a distance of at least six feet [1.8 m] or more.
There is no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Because the vaccine is expected not to exist until the beginning of 2021, the main part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peaks, known as "curve translation".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are dirty, before eating, and after washing their noses, ankles, or linen.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based handhunting that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In the area where commercial handhunting is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not active nitrogen for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a dampener.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they bring the virus to wear a simple face mask.
The extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Self - cleaning, lifestyle, and eating habits are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for people with mild symptoms at the initial stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission Tigkok have published a recommendation to deal with untreated COVID-19 diseases.
Intensive and porous medical personnel in the United States have made recommendations for treatment from various institutions to become a free resource, i.e. IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, some medical authorities recommend parasetamol (astaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen for the first use of linen.
Preventive action should be taken to minimise the risk of virus recurrence, especially in health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health-care professionals who treat COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in the Insular Air Insulation Space (AIR) other than using standard prevention, contact prevention, and air-prevention activities. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protection tools (APD) during the process.
Recommended tools are: APD clothes, respiratory or facial masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, the respiratory (not facial masks) is better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial production, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the U.S.
The N95 Respirator is designed to protect from particulate matter from dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protection or, as a last attempt, its own mask.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most cases are very heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe the related COVID-19 is being actively investigated for those who have been treated blind, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow channels or positive air pressure.
It is not known whether either of these methods bring the same benefits to those who are ill.
Most doctors prefer to continue using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the preaching of aerosol particles compared to the high flow channels. Cases of greater magnitude occur (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many advanced countries do not have a hospital bed per master, which limits the health system's capacity to handle suddenly the number of cases of COVID-19 that are bad enough to require care.
A study in Tigkok found that 5% of intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tigkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 sufferers who were finally treated in ICU.
The mechanical ventilation became more complex than the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurred at COVID-19 and oxygenation became increasingly difficult.
A fan that can perform pressure control mode and a high PEEP need to maximize oxygen transmission while minimising the risk of light damage and related valves.
High PEEP may not be available on an old fan.
A study on treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time by 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be used to treat people with serious illness.
Volunteers recommended by WHO are also involved in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatment. FDA has provided temporary authorization for convalesen plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of a person's very or immediate risk of life.
Plasma convalesen has not yet been studied in order to prove the safety and efficacy of this disease.
In February 2020, Tigkok launched a mobile application to deal with this disease.
User is required to enter their ID and name.
This application is able to detect 'contacts near' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk potential of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk is detected, the application not only recommences the presence of quarantine, but also informs the local health care officer. Data analysis on phone data, facial identification technology, phone tracking, and intelligence used to track infected people and those who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track the alleged coronavirus phone records.
That step was taken to treat quarantine and to protect those who might be in contact with the infected population.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed telephone location data to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in a series of surveys and preventions.
Russia uses facial identification technology to detect quarantine users.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told by a phone operator that "40% of the population is still moving around."
The German government made a 48-hour hack at the end of the week with more than 42,000 players.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersty Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the preaching of coronavirus.
People may be under stress as a result of quarantine, travel bans, side effects, or fear of the infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic instability are perfect storms that endanger mental health and public health."
This disease can be mild and with little or no symptoms, which are similar to respiratory tract disease in general, such as strokes.
Mildness usually takes two weeks to heal, while those who suffer from severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 heavy infections based on data from a similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or an organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart damage, kidneys, and heart damage.
A lack of blood clotting, especially an increase in prothrombin time, was observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while a lack of renal function was seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 picture show an increase in enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between birth and death is ten days, with five days spent in obese care.
However, the patient transferred to the ICU has a median time of seven days between cancer and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time starts from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full six to 41 days break.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tigkok, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung showed the damage of alveolar diffused with fibromyxoid cellular exude in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus are based on pneumonia.
The image is similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with an increase in troponin levels or heart rate.
According to data from Maret, 89% of those treated in the United States have conditions of emergency, and provision of medical and social resources can also affect the region's mortality.
Mortality estimates vary from region to region, but also from methodological difficulties.
At least a simple count can lead to an excessive number of deaths.
However, the fact that death is the result of an ongoing case in the past can mean the mortality rate at this point is too low.
Percocs are likely to have 1.4 times the size of a severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times the most likely need intensive care or death compared to that of a non-percociliar.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20%-to-30-per-30-per-one transfer of lung capacity to some sickly recoverers, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to intensive treatment syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known if previous infections give effective immunity and long term benefits to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunity may be obtained, if you look at the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there has been reports of a case of healed COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests several days later.
This case is believed to be a veritable infection, not a reinfection.
This virus is expected to come naturally from animals, through widespread infections.
In fact, it is not known, but in December 2019, the spread of infections was almost entirely caused by human inventions.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of birth was December 1, 2019.
The WHO official publication reported on December 8, 2019.
In general, some sizes are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region, and are affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first plague, and the characteristics of the population such as age, type of crime, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established a code of ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for death as a result of COVID-19 which was clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without confirmation of the laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The causes of death in the case reflect the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified time-limit.
According to the Statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the global case is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
Other sizes include the number of fatalities of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died of certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died of certain diseases (diagnosis and non-diagnosed).
This statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people infected.
At the spa in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread to young people, caused relatively lower mortality, and probably not all of the deaths of COVID-19 were classified as COVID-19.
In addition, the German health system has not been able to survive.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confirmed because of COVID-19.
The effects of the pancreas and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortalitas is higher for men in studies done in Tigkok and Italy.
The highest risk for a man is at the age of 50, with a distinct risk between a man and a new woman not visible at the age of 90.
In Tigkok, the number of deaths for men with a total of 2.8 percent and for women with a total of 1.7 percent.
Of course, the reason for differences based on this type of sexual activity is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be a factor.
Immunological differences based on the type of feline, lower smoking prevalence of women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women, can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died because COVID-19 is men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the related type of feline infection COVID-19.
Research shows that viruses, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health-care personnel with a different sexity of women is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of becoming infected with the virus.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Theodore Adhanom Gebreyesus explained that CO is short for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is selected to avoid reference to a particular geographic location (e.g. Tigkok), animal species, or a group of people, indicating an international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 to be given the name of the acute respiratory syndrome acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses COVID-19 virus and COVID-19 responsible virus in public communication.
Both the disease and the immune virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tigkok, the virus and the disease are called coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines, which insisted not to use the name of the site in the name of disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal sprays and fan components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needs a fan cap, and the cook can't give in the necessary time scale, a local company they're looking for and printing 100 caps that were needed last night.
After the beginning of COVID-19, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, pigs, and chickens.
There is no approved medicine or vaccine to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization used the "Solidarity Trial" to investigate the effects of the four life-threatening diseases that have already been most promising.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previously research on SARS-COV was used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 were co-used by ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to build a full virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus narrow down the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear asthma vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to find out its safety and reliability. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code derived from the virus that causes the disease. An increased antibodies have been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials going on in April 2020.
Seven trials have been conducted to evaluate the treatment agreed for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The antivirus drug that was given a new purpose forms most of Tingkok's research, with nine Phase III tests on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting date at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamics of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COPID-19 medicinal products are already present.Some of the antiviral drugs that are being evaluated for the treatment of COPID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interferons.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remdesivir clearance.
Clinical improvement observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the United States, Tingkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, is being studied in Tingkok in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is a call to investigate the subject.
Korea's Health Authorities and Tiongkok recommend the use of chloroquins.
However, the Wuhan Virological Institute, although recommending the daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is twice as dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the policy of a doctor who treats the COVID-19.The 7th edition of Tigkok also defines interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data show that a high dose of ribavirin is needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Pene study shows that the initial premium for the tonol protein by transembran 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
A study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has a large limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Sytokin storm complication can happen on COVID-19 heavy stage further.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisytokin properties, tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the Tigkok National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
This drug is undergoing a phase 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe disease.
Combined with serum fertilising tests for the identification of cytokines, this medicine is meant to fight cytokines, which is expected to be the cause of death to some affected individuals.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were agreed by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of sytokin refractory steroid secretion syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is a healing cure for CRS.
Transfer the purified antibody and placed produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being considered as a passive immunosuppression method of non-vaccin.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
The neutralisation of the virus is a work mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity, which depend on antibodies and/or phagositosis, may also be.
Other passive antibody therapy forms, for example, using the monoclonal antibody produced, is being developed.
Convalesen serum production, which is part of the blood flow of patients who have recovered and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Hospital, who later fell victim and died because of COVID-19 after sparking awareness of the spread of the virus.
