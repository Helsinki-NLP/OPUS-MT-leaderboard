New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say that they want to know more about who pays for a 16 billion US-dollar-backed project, supported by Governor Jerry Brown, after the leading representative of the California Water Supply Administration, said that the Brown administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government's funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Administration may contradict the state's long-standing claims that different local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for the Brown vision to extract two equal 35-year-old tunnels to water south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and South California.
The initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels of US$ 248 million, which still needs to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been launched by the federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, state legislators also ordered a state audit on tunnel construction expenditure.
On Thursday, the state speaker Nensija Vogel said that, despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Management Account, no money will be used to complete the current planning phase of the two tunnels from the state's general budget.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the representative of the Assembly, Suzanne Ega, one of the state legislators of the audited state, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It is a game with shopping malls," said David Wolfs, the legal director of the Howard Jervis taxpayers' association.
In my view, this is linked to the evening audit (the request): there are a lot more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply and water consumers in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide a safer water supply for Californians.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering the local species.
Metropolis and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from tunnels still have to pay for their insecurity because of the fact that the investment of large amounts of funds will really provide enough water to repay it.
The same water supply administrations also announced this year that they would not be paid for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Administration states that "the fund has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be granted from the State or the federal budget."
After all that local water supply administrations have spent on the project, including 63 million US dollars from its water supply management, "is expected", that the state will use national money to complete the planning," said Bob Muirs, a L.A. Water supply manager.
He then sent questions to Vogel, the state chief.
Vogela said that the state is planning to allocate to the completion of the cash tunnel planning from the existing half-century old water network, the State Water Project.
However, the tunnel-building opponents point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009 which, they say, prevents the State from spending money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities, which will benefit from it, assume payment obligations for them.
"The project's contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patrízia Šiferle, environmental consultant and former planned tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was recently found.
Addressing a business group under the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has turned to China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and the State of isolation.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecjan has signed 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concerns that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese security product market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show to the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday said that this data loss could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianji: a year since the tragedy
Zhangs Mengfan claims that the company has earned to know what happened in Tianjin.
The Chinese leaders plan silent reminders to mention a wide - scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people on the first day of the year, but not all agree.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a great disaster, a time that the people remember and remember.
But not in China.
Even though the memory service of some dead firefighters is kept in Taijin’s city, such memory measures are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as members of the affected family, have been warned not to speak with foreign press.
However, 23 years old Zhang Mengfan doesn't want to be silent.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Zhangs was a radio operator in the military fire department, which was only a mile away from the explosion centre.
"The call was received yesterday at 22.53, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
Instead, they could arrive within 10 minutes.
The burning of large fires in the chemical warehouse also sped teams from other parts of the city.
None of them paid any attention to the fact that a large quantity of volatile and toxic substances was illegally stored, overcoming the permitted quantities and without proper monitoring.
The fire started when it was allowed that nitrocelluloses, the chemical substances used in the leg of the leg, were used by the party and then the summers were fuelled.
Then it spread in a vast area - 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
There were windows and a fire department, where Zhangs Mengfans waited for radio news from the scene to enter the roof.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the art of fun, I fell into confusion," he told me.
I knew what it meant to my friends.
Of the 26 fire extinguishers who were sent to the blast site, eight of them never returned.
Many others have suffered serious burns and other injuries.
Most of the two major explosions were compared to the earthquake, and the explosion wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated to exceed US$ 1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In general, 173 people were killed, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have not been found either.
The authorities of the official government investigation are the only ones responsible for corruption, political contacts and formal secret agreement, which allowed for circumvention of the rules and for ignoring security systems.
First of all, such storage should never have been built near the home.
More than 100 officials and company managers have been involved in some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, as long as the government can point to the progress made - thousands of homes and compensation for the population, these sensitive issues remain relevant.
Tragedy has been discovered in a gaping system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
Its courage and duty are not questionable, yet without a fire extinguisher as a hero’s image, it is not entirely a pleasing scene.
It contains a fire extinguisher as a victim who was sent to battle with a man - made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but will visit the memory service in Tianji.
He will carry the message of his loved ones who have died.
Most certainly I would like to tell them: I have visited your parents and they are well cared for.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
The cold spring could affect the Scottish rubbing season
Scotland's rubbing season will start later, as the number of birds has decreased this year because of the cold weather.
Several properties have been fired because many of the new rubies have not survived in cold weather.
Noting the beginning of the season, the Association of Scottish Players of the Games (SGA) sends that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Welfare Fund calls for the end of the "brutling of birds".
The director of the organization, Harry Høtton, said: "The work that is invested in providing a large number of birds for shooting is huge and unrelentingly inclusive of all conflicting activities."
There is no surprise that society is avoiding this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban unwanted, unnecessary jobs enjoyed only by a very small part of the people of Scotland.
Landowners both insist that they commit to keeping the number of birds and that shooting rubles is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Aleks Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs in the less-favoured regions of the year and that it has been a "rich job entry" in uncertain times.
He said: "In Scotland, compared to many European countries, the culture of "wood" has not been so strongly encouraged, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the country in terms of economics."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, Frigga Festival, Festival of Celebrations, and Vecga evenings together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game managers and their families want to see the sector's prosperity.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that those who work hard can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the ruby environment.
Many game organizers recognize that rubbing is not popular in general, but SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Ruben shooting season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelfth."
However, there is still much discussion about this type of sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is related to the persecution of some natural protection authorities.
On Thursday, the RSPB, Scotland, said that in less than five years, in Monadliata mountains, southeastern of the Invernes, have lost eight rounds of gold.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the rubble shooting sites and their satellite a process has been destroyed.
Scotland's Environment Minister Rosenna Kaningema said these reports are "very disturbing and confusing."
Ms Kaningemas has asked officials to analyse evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing eagles with broadcasters to determine whether there is a trend towards criminal activity.
The Scottish group blamed the RSPB for attempts to raise anti-fouling feelings before the beginning of the rubbing season, and also mentioned that there was no clear evidence that birds had even been damaged in the vicinity of the Monadlit mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Brionija Peidža for the United Kingdom cut silver in the tramplining
Representative of the United Kingdom of Peedja for the smuggling of silver
Briony Peydza became the first British woman to be at the medal in the Olympics in the tramplining, in Rio.
Peidjai (25) to gold missing 0.425 points, because the Canadian representative Rosenna Maklena had already awarded the second Olympic title in order with a result of 56,465.
The world champion, the Chinese representative Li Dana, was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Ketrina Driscolla, finished her sixth.
I can't believe I fought the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," Peedja said clearly.
I did not feel that it was a medal, but the ability to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had been paid back.
I am so happy that I could start the final with Kate, already one representative's participation in the final would be historic, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic Silver Award, Peedža’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramplining in the Olympics was included in 2000, and this is the first time British women have managed to reach the final.
Medal reaction.
The British team's representative Nathan Beilis, the only representative of men in the race for a trampline attack on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who has been involved in the Olympics for the second time, quickly began to celebrate the success of Peeds.
Peigga has gained a bachelor's degree in biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fidji fans of the silver medal in the regbi-7
12-year-old boy to watch the game, watch half of the year for sugarcane fields up to the nearest TV
Fiji after its history, the first Olympic gold medals are beginning to celebrate an unforeseeable scale
The bank's closed, shoplifted and the holidayers took over Suva Streets, singing, singing, singing and playing
Fiji won a gold medal, at the Deodoro Stadium regbia-7 final with 43-7 ruining Great Britain.
Thousands of people around the island stopped their normal activities to watch the historical game.
Fiji's lead in its history of the first Olympic medal
Many fellows were dressed in Fiji’s colors, and they were dressed in crickets, wearing a national flag, and encouraging the team.
By playing the games at the end of the swing, the excited celebraters went to the streets, humming and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the streets of Suva and joined the flags of Fiji to celebrate, not to touch the small disturbances they had created," says Fiji Times.
Pigs will certainly continue at the end of the week and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Foreign Makenefs entered two first half-time sentences in favour of the Public Council in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second Prime Minister, winning a convincing victory with the result of a 5-0 fight with Finn Harps.
External Makenefs was responsible for managing the "confections" by successfully carrying out the two first half-time penalty sentences, which were awarded for violations against Lucas Schübert.
Nathan Boil entered the gates at the beginning of the second half, and Šübert was able to defeat the enemy in the fourth quarter before the attack by Kita Varda, closing the enemy's funeral in Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will be in the final game on Monday evening at Brendivel.
It was Derry's first victory over his North West competitors in the season, and they disturbed me by the HARPs.
Makenef saved the game in 17 minutes after Kiran Kol was released against Šübert, even though the breach turned out outside the court.
There was no doubt about the second sentence of the sentence, the former "Karameleus stripe" semi-sguard for Bari Molo, leaving Schübert to fall to the ground and Makenef to achieve the result in the 2-0 third minute after the interruption.
Boil added a precise point after Dina Jervis's strike with a foot within the eighth minute after the game began.
Derry City Guard Gerard Doherti had a peaceful evening, but he managed to keep the doors perfectly safe, overcoming David Skalley's guests in the best opening of the game.
Sübert cut the bomb long before Colam was removed in 83 minutes, and soon Varda’s wisdom was restored to the protection of the Harps Centre, Richard Braš.
It was Derry's biggest competition in the series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after mass unordered tests at the University of Highlands and Isles (UHI) course
A total of 20 students could have been released from the Inverness College UHI's highest media course examination.
Most of them were 17 and 18-year-old students who hoped to use the notes they received in their studies to attend the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) investigates these cases.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the highest media assessment available throughout the country in 2016 was "good news".
Twenty students enrolled in the course offered and evaluated by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students had young people living in rural areas who were learning online, but they often had to go to the Inverness College from their places of life, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications on social media that she had not received any evaluation for her work, at least 10 also came up with a statement that she had not received any evaluations about her course work.
He said BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who won this course last year at the Inverness College, and who managed to get in touch, said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that her daughter is unable to provide a place at the University of Glázgova, but she will be able to accept another university offer thanks to the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were also others who visited a college-organized media course that had not been carried out and was now "forgetting" and insecurity about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a view to their admission to universities.
The Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Highlands and Isles.
Diāna Rovlinson, Head of UHI University of Winter College and Executive Director, said: "Our results and student success are very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of the Master's Education Inspection (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the level of achievement in education and higher education in the past year.
As we have done every year, we have reviewed all the results published compared to those predicted by each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out and the assessment authority recently reported "essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "assessments were consistent with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA Press Secretary said, "We are pleased that the highest media evaluation in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there has been a slight increase in A-C performance compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers in prison for samurai teeth "inspirits" in Kilmarno
Jason Braden was attacked with samurai teeth, noses and noodles
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai tooth after a drug-related stroke in Airshire, which was assessed in "blood."
The victim, Jason Breidens (38) was found at his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
At the Supreme Court, James Clark (36) will be tried in prison at least 22 years after the death sentence.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less serious charges of murder.
Encouraging both men to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had made a "unfortunate, cruel and lynching attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Bradeen had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai tooth.
Judge Danlops added: "You are planning an illegal entry together with at least one Nazi and missing."
Jason Bradens may also have been a drug addict, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You put him down.
After the two men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said, "John and James Clark's violent and dangerous action has led to Jason Braden's death."
Getting into the world at 38 years of age is a heartbreaking situation that needs to survive.
The court had previously heard that the brothers from Kilmarnok had decided to seize Mr. Braden’s golden suit, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went to his house in alcohol and drugs, rubbing their faces and arming themselves with noses and Eastern battles.
It is considered that the tooth used in the slaughter belonged to the dead.
The poets said that they saw Clarke shoot the Bride when he sat on the couch at the window and heard their screams.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the courthouse said, "The assault on this man was sustained, chaotic."
Thereafter, the place of slaughter was described as "inhaled".
In addition to injuries from nail holes during the Bride's attack, he suffered a severe trauma with a dirty object.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnokas Kroshaus Hospital.
The two brothers do not confess in secret.
In providing evidence, James Clarks, who has been tried 38 times before, including a murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was just involved in helping a brother who, according to his statement, had hit Bradens."
A man is sentenced to imprisonment for the torture and execution of his child’s age
David Sinclair acknowledged his guilt in the murder of his child in his home in the Real Brain in 2012.
A man who was beaten and killed by the rage of his childhood children because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months ’ imprisonment.
David Sinclair was four months old Josh when he "lost control at the moment" at his home in the Real Kilbraid, South Lansingshire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was determined only after a judicial medical examination.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without prior punishment.
In the Supreme Court of Glázgova, indicting him to prison, Judge Lords Briesidls Sinclair said: "You have attacked your child's age by cutting him, by causing the damage he is looking at."
When you cut her, you had to know it, but you didn't find it.
Only after thorough medical examinations have you acknowledged what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now his feelings have been transferred and you can no longer be supported.
Lord Plusidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as a "catastrophe" for everyone and added, "Nothing will ever come back to Josh."
The court had previously found that on the day that the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Kersty, went to swim with Joshua and to buy a car.
At 5:30 p.m., Kärsty Sinclair went to meet his mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later she was called by Sinclair, who heard "shocked."
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like he's coming, even at home."
Then he ended the conversation and called for 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermira’s hospital, where he died.
At first, the cause of Joshua’s death was not clear, but he was looked at by a team of medical experts, who soon found the consequences of his death in the eyes and brains, and such injuries were not possible by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, the neurosurgery of children in Oxford at the John Redcliffe Hospital, said: "This has happened because the child has been tortured and thus has earned the blame, as well as affected by more force than daily."
The defense representative, Jans Djugid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely sorry".
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Holoja Tatone threatens July Jefimovas positions
To a British representative, Tatonei is released from the arms of bronze in the 200 m swim
The UK representative, Chloe Tatone, criticises the participation of the jurors of the jurors of July Jefimova in Rio games after the Russian representative beats them in a 200 m swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following the complaint concerning the prohibition of participation in doping, removed the silver by leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean," said 20 years old sailor.
I didn't say who was in there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's what it is.
Jefimova, who won the second place, learned about his participation in the games just three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think that's really right.
She was not supposed to participate in the competition, and her 20 - year - old British representative had to score a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, defeating Jefimov, who was at the silver medal.
Chinese representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only six hundred seconds after Tatoni left the fourth unit.
Her British teammate, 20 - year - old Molly Renšov, finished at six.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you have," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little confused about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, meeting at the end is an excellent experience I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it will make me look more and more for the medal, so I'll probably get closer to it next time.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds away from British record women at the end of the swim.
"Every man must give another chance," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said she was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after her body was found footing anabolic steroids.
The Sports Disciplinary Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be prevented from participating in Rio games because they have already had appropriate sanctions.
CAS looked at my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and there's another opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it certainly wasn't my fault.
Each person must be given another opportunity.
When you go out and you get the ticket, no one puts you in jail.
Bens Prauds takes off the place in 50 free-style swimming
A British record was previously installed to eliminate the place of men at the end of 50 m of free-style swimming.
The distance of the Union champion Prauds (21) was 21.54 seconds for the fifth fastest qualified Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is harmless and rough
Indian Sports Minister Vijays Goels Rio Olympics has been an all-encompassing character, often held in the courts, encouraged Indian athletes and taking the selves after their start.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the anger of the Olympic game organizers due to their uncontrollable behavior, repeatedly trying to break out to the competition areas without adequate accreditation and gross response when being checked by the India News Agency Press Trust of India.
Vijays Goels, photographed in July, justify his conduct.
Wednesday, Olympic game organizers threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behaviour would not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company were trying to enter restricted access areas at the place and in the arena where the shooting and shooting take place.
"We have received a number of reports that your sports minister has tried to enter the accredited areas of competition with persons who are not accredited," the statement writes in the continental manager of the Committee of Organizers, Sara Peterson, Rio 2016.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes they broke out with our staff.
"If the team of our protocol becomes aware of any other such behaviour, the accreditation of your sports minister will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The head of the Indian delegation referred to this case as "from a musty celery," and Goels himself said he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as "understanding".
On Twitter he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
In other words, this Olympic game for India has all the fumes, there are no medals in the meantime.
Hopeless fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Felps has fought so many medals - 26 - as India has in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in 2008 in Beijing.
This time he left the fourth.
The wind launches money and opportunity," writes the author and column author Shoba De in the Sardinian poem.
However, there are still some strange hopes, as there will still be in the competition box, golf, tennis, light - yellow and, yes, in the hungry.
The only Indian winemaker, Dipa Karmakara, will attend the summer finals on Sunday, showing his terrible double turn "Daves laciens", a producer of the summer, which has tried only a few other winemakers.
In a country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of prized medals in India has always been a cause for concern.
Analysts say it has countless reasons.
National anger is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a significant contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmakar's first gear was made from old-school spare parts.
Parents have always emphasized the overriding of academic knowledge about sports.
And the authorities responsible for sports have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has replaced the Indian Olympic Association for Violations of its Statutes in 2012, as it has elected leaders against whom criminal cases are proposed.
In Sochos three members of the Indian Winter Olympics even refused to represent their country, carry a flag, or wear anything with a national symbol.
They meet as independent athletes.
When people get the blame, the turbulence jetBlue plane route Boston-Sakramamento is forced to leave in South Dakota.
JetBlue was forced to perform an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sakramento.
Travel 429 from Boston to Sacramento left in Rapids, South Dakota, just before 7:30 p.m. after the local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been transferred to the hospital for tests.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the injured, has banned the spare aircraft to deliver the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) launches a long-term opportunity for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is that there is little faith.
This is a loss of opportunity, which may result in further delay in treatment for countless people.
To date, there is only one source of medical marijuana approved at the federal level at Mississippi University.
It seems a little more positive today that the DEA has also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the level of marijuana available for scientific purposes and diversity could be expanded.
Even if it focuses on a good study, it will be symbolic to a large extent, as no matter how many marijuanas are available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is very required but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to a request for a product which takes a difficult, understandable decision to produce it more, but it is and will never close the door.
This product is a marijuana and its location in list 1 is this closed door.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance listed in list 1 (respectively, as defined "not currently approved medical use and there is a high potential for its unforeseen purposes"), there are significant obstacles to the unlocking of the doors.
Potential researchers usually focus on the DEA because it permits the initiation of scientific studies.
Even if authorisation is granted for the examination of substances listed in list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems that may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of the authorisation of its academic authority to conduct first-order studies of substances included in list 1.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or any possible side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at Arizona University when Dr. Søu Sisly was released from the job of attempting to advance medical marijuana trials.
Sisley eventually sought private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first medical marijuana attempt to prevent post-traumatic stress for the veterans, approved by the DEA.
Then, after years of fighting bureaucratic barriers, the National Institute for Drug Addiction has been entrusted with the latter key.
At present, it is the largest federal funding provider of marijuana research, and it is the only provider of marijuana itself.
Even if the free circulation of studies will increase the amount of medical medicine, the Institute will still have to approve all of its funded studies.
However, the problem is in its name 'misuse'.
The representative of the San Francisco University, Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary "Marihuāna", said that the Institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medicines.
Ebram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study can overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of the medical marijuana rather than the harm it has caused.
Note: During the last five years, 1,434 works in the U.S. National Medical Library on medical marijuana were found in quick (and unscientific) search.
In the same search, only 57 works were for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the harm done by marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marihuana caused pancreatitis" and "Using marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportion creates a completely distorted scene.
The way to medical marijuana is mixed with surprises and beauty, where only the sight is open.
As long as DEA is present in list 1 with no medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of canabinide patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to identify marijuana with heroin and LSD as a potential for creating high-dependence drugs, even though DEA’s main administrative judge Francis Jangs objected to it.
In the medical sense, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed food products.
For example, ten fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuanas to raise death.
Marihuana is in its natural form one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to man.
Reasonable analysis of marijuana may be safe to use in medical care when it is monitored.
It must be said again that it was proposed by the DEA judge itself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of luxury in our daily life.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to make it sound, or we're so tired or confused that no one seems to have noticed it.
As regards excellence in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, it must be able to present facts without undue delay.
Patients' lives, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
The fact that the plant can do so much good and still be behind closed doors is worth speaking at the highest level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondais Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
The musicians say that Tramps dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we've been to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps looks like Blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music band "The Bloody Beetroots" told CNN.
The President of the Republic is a candidate and a politician, an Italian media magnet, both known for his exaggerated personality, the ability to attract the press attention and the media for the changed stories.
"Bloody Beetroots" is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Polo Macartney and ending with electropope singer Greta Svabo Beci in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basāno del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, about the time of Pancrok’s birth, and the figures "1977" were placed on the chest.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he is familiar with.
I'm trying to study, and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to look at "Videos", a documentary that explores the Berlin monopoly on the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy's track," said Rifo, adding that Trampam had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and throw everything out... by his own," he said.
I don't think Tramps is good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors imprisoned in a prison of more than 500 million pounds in drug trafficking
Two Turkish men were sentenced to over 500 million pounds of worth of cocaine smuggling on a ship in the North Sea for at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahins and Emins Ozmens were found guilty of a trial in the Supreme Court in Glázgov after about 100 juries from the coast of Aberdina on the MV Hamal deck were found three tons of class A drugs.
The detention in 2015 is one of the largest cocaine-contained cargo delivered in Europe at any time in the sea.
Mominam Sahinam and Eminam Ozmenam were sentenced to imprisonment for his role in a large-scale drug deal
The cargo of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
Narcotics were found hidden in a specially-equipped hiding place in Tanzania, which sailed from Istanbul to Tenerifi and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force angle "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozmen (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glázgovas.
Justice Lord Kinklevens told the men that the amount of drugs was "not only important but extensive", and drug trafficking has "grassy impact" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You have been involved in commercially in the most extensive operation, including the transport of cocaine by ships, in an operation that has crossed the international and truly cross-border borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not "drug at the end of the tree", but he had a significant role in the crime, while the second Captain of Ozmen's role was "to a lesser extent".
The inspectors went up to Hamal's deck after collecting information from the French customs office DND, and when it arrived in Aberden, they rushed through the steel plate, accessing the secret compartment where 128 cocaine-weighted chains were found, of which a total of 512 million marks were found in the black market.
Last year, MV Hamal inspected the royal fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on the ship.
During the inspection of the vessel, it was found that its ballast tanks contain a ton of class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the shore of the Bospora Sea to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the cabinet in one of the crew's premises, and the plug was sealed.
Sahins and Ozmen were found guilty of the transport and hiding of cocaine on board from 20 February to 23 April and of the supply of cocaine from 21 April to 23 April.
The two unsuspecting men who have been working in the shipping industry since the end of school continue to claim that they are not guilty, however, are taking the oath.
The charges against four other men lack evidence.
Sahina's lawyer Jonathan Krov said that married father of two children is "glorified muzzle".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to run a ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahins is certainly not a drug at the bottom of the tree, but a little lower.
Extensive quantity of cocaine on board means that it was to be disposed of by road
The police went through the whole ship for days before drugs were distributed through these boxes.
He asked Sahina about his captain's work on "Hamal" in February 2015, and the court heard.
Mr Krova said that he was "shocked" about the fact that the events of daughter (9) and son (13) should be long-lasting and "just want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain visas.
Ozmen's lawyer Di Murs said that he "exactly" wants to see his family, but he knows that in the future it will "not be possible".
Speaking after the judgments read out today, the Scottish Prosecutor David Harvey said: "The international drug trade has no border, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working more closely together to achieve that we are one step forward.
"The success of Scotland in the prosecution of criminals is indeed global, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
Narcotics were found in all the holes on the ship, including under the floor.
This smuggler pack inspectors found in the hidden vessel’s vessel’s cargo compartment
Mr. Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified on the basis of intelligence from the French authorities, and on the basis of rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship was registered, a general prosecutor who also allowed to board.
"Our investigation then came from Gijana, who gave access to important data on shipments to Spain, which gave us very valuable information about the ship's detentions in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific evidence elements.
Despite the basic research information that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters on it were unable to do so without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something like what they had never given before.
Sju Peitna, the Prosecutor of the Royal Criminal Cases (CPS) International Justice and Organized Crime Control, said: "By acting quickly and accurately, the CPS Criminal Law Counsel was able to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board within 24 hours of receiving information.
Under international maritime law, officials of the United Kingdom are not entitled to cross international waters on board vessels flying the flag of another country unless that State has a special legal permit to do so.
Without the quick action of our criminal counsel, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to responsibility.
Photographer Braiens Romeidgens lives on the busy "East Express" train
Photographer Braiens Romeidgens from Rotterdam took pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
Images visible inside the rolling train, secluded seats, dust-covered windows and a narrow machine cabin
It has already been referred to as an Eastern Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The city researcher has taken these significant photographs, which show that the remains of the passenger train have been one of the best types of movement.
Its flowering times have long gone by, and the train wagon and locomotive have been left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photographer and adventure search engine.
Photographer Braiens Romeidgens, 40, has taken these terrible photographs, where the train’s rolling inside, the hidden seats, the dusty covered windows and the pressured driver’s cabin
The train car and locomotive have been left to feel the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search engine.
These trains were a symbol of horror when they operated under the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian National Railway Company was used by locomotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on track, the last train operating with the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, closing the famous history phase.
Eastern expression was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it started in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French language "Express d'Orient".
It was about the Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it had already been a regular route across Europe.
This should not be mixed with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
There's a very small "Company Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagon left.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open guides are still installed in the narrow cabin of the machinery in which the equipment is operated.
Romeo said that the machine cabin is "in its own way claustrophobic, and the locomotive noise must have been unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and adventure visitor review.
After a forgotten train visit to Belgium, the Romanian MailOnlineTravel said, "I could really sense how it was used in its flowering season."
In the path of the high lords, beautiful ladies are accompanied by beautiful garments.
Grima artist Ketrina Gelovey's retop series "Arrested Development" in Bustera
Thanks to her impressive healing skills, reviews and conversions, texasiete and YouTube census Ketlina Gelova has been at the fan army.
However, her last conversions to Buster Blut from "Arrested Development" are totally unbelievable by any standards.
Three minutes in a video clip, uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelova slowly and constantly transforms itself into a failed image with a hook in place of hand.
At the end of the clip, she even uses an audio recording from this dangerous but at the same time in a great performance.
The talented artist starts his video in his, blonde woman's image.
Then, using slow photographs, she slowly turns into a brilliant "memorial moon", which is already disposing of her hair, and which is Tony Heila Buster's Blue.
Gelova does this with colorful contact lenses, by shadeing and wearing contours around the nose and eyes, and by drawing Baster face on his head.
Wisely: Using slow photography, she slowly turns to Tony Heila Buster.
During her video she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners, also pulling the teeth.
The clip, which has been placed on YouTube, has been seen more than 45,000 times, and all of a sudden, the artist's skills have shown famous comments:
"You're extremely talented," someone recorded under the video in Gelova.
During her video she also takes over the cult TV image personality and manners
"I like how you do it all in the picture," another added.
Video blogger Ketlina Gelova had already successfully converted to Ron Svenson's "Parks and Recreation" image.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future, she was looking forward to creating gray conversions every week.

The Lancasian father is expelled from school from the school for wearing T-shirts with a good name
Two children's father was expelled from their school about their arrival on their sports day in the T-crek with an offensive inscription.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children's City of Lankashira says that he "was a young man" when he pulled a cracker with a inscription "Laiž and Dr.!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his miscarriage and pulled the T-shirt in reverse, on the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father who has been working for four years as the principal of the Park School in Colna, Children, was not able to come behind children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
Craig Makbets (36) from the Child says that he was not placed in the school territory after the children’s sports day had arrived in a challenging T-shirt.
Mr. Childly accuses the school director, Saru Midjlyi, of reacting too much.
He says that he has been unjustly punished because, before going to see his two children's competitions, the errors soon attracted the T-shirt.
The father, who no longer works as a school manager, said, "It was a mistake and an ignorance on my part."
I don't think about sports day and hurry when I pull it.
Near the end of the event, we had father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was inappropriate.
I apologized and turned it on the other side, and that also ended the case.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the president of the school last night when he was invited to a meeting with the director the next day, but he did not feel the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The school director then called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," Mr. Bärnlia added.
I learned that after a sports day some parents on Facebook had been upset about it and that many people were interested in it.
Anyone who thinks differently would say that it's out of the question.
Mr. Makbeta, who is the editor of the online journal Love Mini, said that he thought he could not even come behind the children on the last semester day because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from school and social services.
On the T-Creck there was the image of Craig Charles Lister from the BBC cult comedy "The Red Roosevelt" with one of his iconic statements "Laiž and Dr.."
He said, "I told them I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I wasn't behind the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school and that the ban would be in force until further notices.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could apply 500 pounds of fines if he would be subject to the violation of this rule.
Sarah Midzlija, the principal of the Park School, said that the case is now over.
Sara Midzlija, Director of the Park Primary School, said, "I can confirm that Mr. Makbeta has resigned from his post and is no longer our school leader."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to my school life in September."
The child’s city counselor, Joe Kouniy, said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to keep in mind that, when taking up such a position as an adviser or a leader, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet those standards," he said.
Counsellor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not believe that he needed to apply the ban and that he had been thrown out of the shell.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not.
Recently, the VEF premises of the former factory, located on the path to Freedom, have been renovated - there have several IT companies, the industry has already started to call this site a local Silicia valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Bérzane, is also being developed.
The development and construction of the 2nd round project at the LU Academic Centre in Tornjakala will pay €21 million.
The final procurement announced by the University of Latvia on the development, construction and self-monitoring of the second-order technical project of the Academy Centre in Tornjakal, Riga, shows a statement on the Procurement Monitoring Office website.
The purchase was carried out in the form of a negotiation procedure without prior publication of the contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the LNK Industries Group, which has committed to carrying out these works at EUR 21 186 560.
As explained in LU, the University, starting the planning and implementation of the project planning period of the European Union Fund for 2014-2021, continues the next series of academic complex - the building of the Science Centre - the design, authoritarian supervision and construction, according to the Skik project and the specified year of construction.
The building of the centre of science by its type of core activity shall be similar to the building of the building of the Natural Sciences Academic Centre designed and constructed in the form of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as to the scientific and academic staff and students present in the building.
The competition regulation was accompanied by the SIA Sixth style sketch project, which provided all potential suppliers with information on the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Tornkal, including the listing of the planned objects of the University of Latvia Academic Centre, which specifies the name of each specific object, the expected area of the object, the planned year of the transfer of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015, the Sixth style of the building complex meta corrections were carried out by the previously developed university of the University of Latvia in Tornjakala, as a result of which the location of the academic centre buildings and their interconnection were clarified, as well as the transport organisation in and around the meta area.
Announces a tender for the application of the medicinal product to the road section in the lanes.
The carrier of the VAS Latvian highways has announced the purchase of a mechanized medicine for filling the road section in the bands in the regions of Latvia and Pirīga, informs the LAU.
The object of the purchase is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgavas, Rēzeknes, Valmieras, Talsu and Riga for the needs of the road areas.
Applicants may submit an offer for one or more lots.
It is necessary to insert the product into the lanes of road separation in order to improve the transparency of the roads and the surrounding areas, to facilitate the flow of water from the road, as well as to limit the seat of the product and the formation of the faucet.
The most valuable product loading works for farmers in the Tals road area totals 28 motorways 637 travelling kilometres, in the Valmier road area 20 roads 432 travelling kilometres, while in Alūksnna on 17 roads 384 traveling kilometres.
It has already been reported that in June, the company completed the application of the product on the main and most important regional asphalt roads, but on the smaller regional roads and on the local roads, the holder of the VAS Latvian highways planned to entrust the part of the application to farmers.
"We have the opportunity to make more effective use of the funding allocated to the maintenance of the highways, while giving farmers the opportunity to complete the technique and to earn a profit," says the President of the Board of Directors Vladimir Kononov of the VAS Latvia Roads.
The time limit for submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Legal protection: Demagogy on the mandatory health insurance model with additional financial burden on citizens does not suffer any criticism.
Any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and excessive burden on the citizens, does not hold any criticism, is considered to be the legal guardian Juris Janson.
Janson met with health ministers today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After meeting the journalists, Janson said that the industry financing model offered by the Ministry of Health is a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that additional funding for health care should be mentioned in this case, as it is not sufficient at the moment.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and excessive burden on citizens, would not be considered as a criticism, especially if the Netherlands model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands had allocated 11% of its gross domestic product to health while Latvia was only 3%.
Therefore, the government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that from the point of view of this hunger must be raised, expressed a guardianship and added that, on the contrary, the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work.
Chaša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concerns are that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out that the planned additional EUR 35 million would be possible for the next year only the most acute cases in relation to oncology patients and the remuneration of birth specialists.
VM has therefore developed a plan and has submitted a request for an additional €41 million for health care in order to reduce the lines of expertise and investigations.
"The question of priorities, whether or not funds will be available," Chaksha said.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that doctors are not concerned that VM is driving all three options in the government for the examination of the health funding model, including the one that provides for additional payment for patients, Chaksa said that, when driving all three models, the government is given the opportunity to choose from.
Janson also added that, by moving all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not prepared to impose additional burdens on the population.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the variant of the health funding model, which does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires part of the social tax to be shifted to health, says the summary of the conceptual report on the change in the financing model of the health care system in Latvia.
At the same time, the Ministry has indicated that the best option for health funding will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local orbs are ready.
Arbūsi has given up this year, acknowledges the owner of Arūs Rolands Dambis, of the village of Grobė, Medzes.
Orbs are already purchased on the Liepaja market.
By producing a number of early varieties, but later the bubbles have been well abandoned, the regional newspaper Kursa Time sends.
"This year, labor grows better than last year," says the great egg farmer in Rucavas village, Artis Čousis.
And in terms of weather, it was much more favourable in summer than in the past when it was cold and windy.
The Liepaja Theatre is opening in Riga.
On August 12th and 13th, in the theatre of Dales, the theatre of Liepaja will be the guest of Liepaja in Riga, offering viewers both the performances nominated for the "Game Night" award and the brilliant intrigue - the solo performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein, the portal "Delfi" informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of 12 August, viewers will be shown the drama of the man's "Golden Man", invented by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Mary - who lived in the Victorian era in London and his body, because of the deformed body of the inherited disease, was called the Cylon Man.
In the study the title was created by the actor Egon Dombrovskis, who received the title of the title "Game Night" for Mary's role as an actor.
As critic Norman Akts described his performance, Meriks is "through the heart" a role in which the child's image cannot be repeated."
On 13 August, a study entitled "Portraits" will be offered to viewers.
The exhibition received six nominations for the Night of the Games, including the "Year-size show".
The director made the impression as a self-made portrait gallery, equal to the importance of assigning each window to each image, so each of them has both a center and a background.
The display consists of it as of a number of mini outputs that end up in a single whole.
It is a observation of the nature of a person, where the main conflict is between real emotions and a cold calculation, by discovering how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who for the sake of her wealth and for the sake of its own sake crushes the surrounding, sometimes the sheep which is crushed by someone else.
On the other hand, both dates will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein, "The Man who More From the Lift" in Polish mode.
It is not a sad story, but a full story of how a person’s only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the capsy stylisticity that dominates the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the invention is still light and even optimistic.
"A man who is more of an elevator" is not about the determination of loneliness and age, but about the worth of life to love.
Also, if it seems that there is no point," critic Liga Ulbert wrote about the performance.
Tickets on all studios can be bought in the "Booking Paradise" box and online.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serious but a real life.
I already have a half-way waiting for Olga Zeļik - the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
His sounds smile and leave a very positive impression on the person.
Dressed in white trousers and white jacket - a very elegant woman who embraces all my ideas about what to be a woman-detector.
She's waiting for me with champagne, and I'm gonna say good-bye.
I'm told I spoke to him because I thought it was interesting that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
It's always the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - Master's degree.
He's been working with the criminal police at the time.
You realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his company.
That's what I'm talking about.
"I really didn't want to go back to the police," Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We work with suspects.
"Let's celebrate this year's 10-year anniversary of Riga Detective Agency."
She's calling for the anniversary celebration: "There's no drinking."
They're all cursed people.
The question about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that working on the team sometimes is dangerous.
It's a business when, if someone does a non-professional job, he can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are in fifth power, then we're the second.
It's not simple, of course.
Many try to buy us out because we are dealing with a life - threatening illness.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask if you can put in hearing aids to attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," Olga says.
If there is a crime under the law, I have to warn.
The storms have green ink and we laugh - to be at least a brush with which to hold up and lead the negotiations.
I've had a client whose husband's always been with me.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," says Olga.
The psyche is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a wolf.
It can end badly.
Don't give God, with your own self-esteem.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to leave their families and then come back," she says.
I reject the last order.
"It was the first time in my life," Olga says.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman had a miscarriage, she had a son.
"His husband sat down and made himself disabled," Olga recalls.
I believe that a woman has the instinct of mother, and, first of all, she needs to protect her children.
When all this came to pass, she came to me with a request to be released from her husband.
There are people who are obsessed with ambition.
The most dangerous thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find a body once, and the dog was very helpful.
No dogs can be found in the drug department at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are current.
Or there is a divorce in the family, and information needs to be collected.
It is made clear what is a guilty party.
The last thing I've ever had was the subject of the other Witnesses being reminded of.
That's interesting, because sometimes men smack, now women.
Even best friends are fighting!
Women "displace" threats for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when traveling abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and very confident," Olga says.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband like Jesus Christ.
It's very high, it's very thin.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different person.
"I'm the one who pulled them out," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
The question is, what is the most unusual thing you've ever met, Olga says, "All are special, but it's the most spectacular thing where trust is used."
When friends are "lost" friends.
Picks up and doesn't give up.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, another - to have it," Olga says.
The situations when we deal with infidelity are at the very least a snare, as women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an invisible situation, for man is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman was prepared to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel a taste of money use rich married men.
One man who pursued his wife said that he could not be loved because all his wives were cheating on him.
"He had taken three times," Olga recalls.
At the same time, it is a man’s problem if all his wives are cheating on him.
Olga relates the case of a woman who left her husband with all the children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
Above all, I kept sitting at him, he answered.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I think it's interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to a living member if there's evidence of fraud.
How's it going?
"There is protection of the data of natural persons for the work of a paralysis detective," says Olga.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows everything to be done, the other does not allow anything.
We can take such photographs and videos for personal interest, but not for public viewing.
If a matter which does not comply with the law is brought before the court, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, not enough education and experience, it must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, it's handled by the police.
I tell clients - get out of the show, here's real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs also had to be used, they helped a lot.
"There is no way in the drug department without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients are looking at me about the murder investigation, but I don't like to do such things.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more clients of men, because women tend to take care of men.
Sometimes it was different.
Now women have fun, but men sit at home with children.
"Of course, you're the most right people," it's Olga.
I like Deils in Karnegi.
He says - stop pulling and start living real.
We all know that if you're on one side, you'll have to turn the other, but it's not!
You have to say that you don't like it.
It must not be done.
You must not be afraid to lose what is in your life!
You shouldn't be a little boy, and what we're allowed to do with ourselves is what happens to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to a man’s infidelity when the woman was not prepared to accept the fact that the man was cheating on him.
She called all the time and asked what to do.
"I now ask all clients whether they are willing to accept the situation when they know that a man is really cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not fun, it's life.
If you're coming with a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, it's a show, it's a real life.
I'm also a specialist.
It is a heart matter and related to Japanese medicine - hand-treated treatment.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working on it?
This is related to a large amount of adrenaline, and I need something to calm down.
It needs not only to calm down, but to restore energy, light.
"People get out of my office positively and satisfied," Olga says.
She has the signs at the wall office, and Olga tells us that they are written, not by a boat, but by fingers.
I'm not that simple until I get there, the book about my needs literally in my hands.
Feels like a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Find out more about this.
Olga also sings.
It's her free will.
We're all in trouble.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smiling, but I have to rest to recover.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol in the throat.
The police use it a lot because work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and walking can be unforeseeable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and needs.
I've been working or tennis for 15 years.
I still needed horses.
I would like to write a book in nature, articles.
The detective's work is a narrow limit when it comes to your life.
"It is a work that should not be put into life," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My beloved person is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
At that time, I have the most true love in my life.
I've had enough to think about him, and I'm already feeling better.
Detectives usually don't believe it, but he's taken my job.
Actually, I'm separating work from private life.
I'm not the same in this business.
Needy's got me.
Already when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the need, the intuition is open.
There's a lot of detectives, but they're really working, very little.
In any case, it is work with brains, and it is difficult to turn off.
You also need rest.
"Wherever you can't come back," Olga admits.
The most powerful case I've ever been working with is the story of Constance.
I've been working on it for a year.
The man was literally cheating on the woman.
I did so that my mother and I went to England - away from danger.
There was no other option.
We mustn't want to.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We need to be happy about every day that we have.
Thank God.
Every day, three good things must be told to someone else.
You have to do a good job or take a day.
We can't do that with men.
That's a big mistake.
We need to understand that there is a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to go back and get away.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
You don't have to be a fan, but you do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if you don't change, you have to leave and change your life.
In no case should you put yourself and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already in need and are not dedicated in this world.
You must never sit on the ground!
How better to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the immediate present of the current year of education that families are able to enjoy in photovoltaic life.
To illustrate how to prepare for the photo session already, it is worth considering how to view all the views that will be considered happy and beautiful.
The advice "Ihappymama" provides a multi-child mother to Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It must be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
It is much more difficult for children to get involved and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of dress for the entire family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Alexander tells us that he chooses clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three ton of color and as little as possible to write on the clothes.
Don't forget about a good condition.
Listen, laugh, play, but never bother and not psycho, if children are not immediately as obedient as they would like.
And, look, the next tips are already taken from the professional photo shop!
You have to understand exactly what you want to experience during the photo session and tell about their photograph.
For some they will be beautiful, neat children and ideally formed family image, for others - "life is what it is," that is, in the choice of images to see real, true emotions, or, as to love to say the photograph itself, - "eating back", "breathed eyes", "breathed ash".
Of course, someone wants "two in one," but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you come to the photo session, you need to understand that they are only a few hours away from your life, and because you're less excited than you're better.
You are yourself - not even the hard mom who works, prepares to eat, grows and continues to eat, and not the hired dad who talks on the phone forever.
And not that man, who dwelleth in thee, after the manner of a fool that is not known.
Be a family, remember how wonderful it is to hug each other, smile at each other, and smile.
And then the photographer's task will only be to capture the real moments of emotion that governs between you.
If you choose a photographer, then trust him.
It ceases 250 times to ask to show what has happened, to listen to his advice in the choice of clothing, instead of better frames.
Drag and drop all necessary clothes in advance so that the photo session should no longer be handled on the day of the photo session.
Plan the route and think about how long you will need to go to the photo-session site (especially if the photography takes place in the study and the time is limited).
If you have young children, choose the time for photosession that corresponds to the day-to-day withdrawal regime, so that it does not occur when the baby usually sleeps dinedus.
And of course, it is unforgettable to take with children food, vegetables, water and favorite toys (mantine and sweets used only in extreme situations).
My dad prepared that he might need to pull the bags, but he doesn't usually write these tips, and only photographers know what the problem is, Marina recognizes it.
It doesn't drink much water before a photo session and it's a good one before it.
And it would still be advisable after the photo session to arrange a party for everyone together.
Go to the attraction park, eat some sweets, go to the ski slopes - which the family likes more.
At the same time, you will have received wonderful pictures and pleasant memories of the day together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Minimum wage raising - wonder or brake for the economy?
The issue of minimum wages in public discussions is almost or the status of holy cattle: either the promotion of the promotion or the mention of any unspoken, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (only we have barely avoided technical recession), we think it is important to stress that the minimum wage is not a miracle that reduces the inequality of income with one household, closes to the level of Latvia's wages in Western Europe and fills the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum wage is too much, it causes more damage than the benefit, as it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
In the first moment it seems that, despite a number of increases in the minimum wage in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high as to significantly reduce the competitiveness of businesses for the first few decades of the year - only EUR 370, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about half a thousand.
However, a different scene is open when compared to the average wage in Latvia (%) - minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the share of the minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar minimum wage increase is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the surveys carried out by the Latvian Bank, each fifth Latvian company replied that the increase in the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014 was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increase was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, price increases for several companies meant loss of competitiveness on both the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports were encouraged).
Due to the lower competitiveness and the volume of smoking production, almost every 15-year Latvian company was important to release workers (meaning greater unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven-year-old company replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia has not changed.
Therefore, even if, in assessing the creation of the 2014 minimum wage, each fifth company has noted an important improvement in productivity, it does not yet mean that a similar result could also be expected in 2017 (the fourth minimum wage increase could gradually reduce productivity opportunities).
Another important result is - because of the increase in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earned more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where the minimum wage was not received by any of the employees.
In recent years, the increase in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in the minimum wage, which is not based on the increase in productivity, will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses, despite the overall low level of the euro.
When assessing the validity of the minimum wage, it is not sufficient to analyse the average economic indicators.
It is also necessary to assess whether the minimum wage is to be raised in the "panesa" sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most often used.
The results of the Latvian Bank's survey show that employees with minimum wages are the most concentrated in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum salaries was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latvia, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further increase can be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs indicate that the increase in minimum wages implemented in 2014-2015 (a total of 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would leave so much on average wages from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice as high as the national minimum wage.
Lithuania's lowest salary is in the Taraga region, but also there was 54% of the average wage in 2015 (by two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the discussions of the company, the time-consuming call for a minimum wage of up to 68% of the average wage in the country (e.g. here) lacks economic justification and is not implemented either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure of average wages or even so close is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the bankruptcy and massive redundancy of these companies), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The minimum wage will be raised from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, to make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average salary) one of the EU's highest.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, it has clearly negative effects on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such adverse effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is already often used, for example in Latvia.
The fact that we cannot allow a significant increase in the minimum wage right now means that other mechanisms must be used to support low wage beneficiaries.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling at an unsustainable minimum (within the limits of budgetary possibilities) of the income tax.
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate quality of education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfying health status (which often occurs not due to the greed and long-term health care of the doctor) are mentioned among the real causes of inequality of income.
During the period considered, 521 responses were received from the Latvian company regarding the increase in the minimum wage in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the project of the European System of Central Banks in the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN).
These figures represent companies with a minimum of 10 employees.
It also explains the proportion of low-employees with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires are registered in Latvia during the last day, showing operational information from the National Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In the case of Latvia, the biggest fires were in the state of Ogres novad Ogresgal, where 80 square meters of fuel units were unmanaged in the residential house and in the railway street in Jjekabpil, where with an open flame of fire, a thin layer of dust was filled in 30 square meters.

Legendary editor Hafington abandons "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafington, an influential U.S. media holder "The Huffington Post" and the editor-in-chief, announced that after 11 years of work, the company was released.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded the Pulicera Prize, which offers every day serious policy and economic journalistism, as well as the reflection of internet sensations in the news, is considered a source of media development at the time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, already starting work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time under conditions where there was no TV yet, but Feisbuk gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that media journalists represented liberal values, and with this world’s view also prepared news material.
Now Hafington's tweeter has discovered that after retirement he is about to start a new business - he plans to create a "Trive Global" launch that would address the health and overload of workers.
In the meantime, it is not known what could be in her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During their work, the portal refused to comment anonymously, stressing to Hafington that freedom of speech is granted to people who take on what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
She also led a decision in the summer of 2015 to publish the news section on Donald Tramp as President of the United States.

With these transactions "The Huffington Post", an influential and independent media, became a small part of a large corporation.
Currently the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, the total number of unique visits per month is estimated at 81 million.
Four people were shot in Thailand.
Nine explosions have occurred in the southern provinces of Huahin and the southern provinces of Thailand during the last 24 hours, killing at least four people and several dozens of wounded, were reported by the authorities on Friday.
In the south of Thailand, two explosions occurred on Friday at eight o'clock after local time.
One explosion exploded in front of the sea police building, killing the municipal staff and hurting a man, the governor of the province of Surattān, Vongsiri Promčana, announced.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the police station.
In the southern part of Thailand, on Friday morning, two explosions took place on the famous Phukites island.
On Friday morning, two explosions exploded at the bell tower in Huahin, killing one and hurting three people.
It has already been reported that two explosions occurred in Huahin City shortly before Thursday evening, killing one woman and hurting another 19 people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin was a Thai woman.
Three of the 19 injured were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners — four women and three men.
Bombs in Huahin were hidden in two wells, 50 meters from each other.
The syringes were detonated with mobile phones with a half-hour difference.
Before that, on the fourth day one man died in an explosion in the province of Trana in southern Thailand.
The police rescue babies from a car overcrowding; the parents are threatened by a flashing glass with judicial work.
In Riga last night, local policemen rescued children from a traffic jam, while the child’s parents threatened police with judicial work on the glass of a stolen car, the agency LETA informed the Riga City Police (RPP).
Yesterday at the patrol, a man who had told me that a car in Spice’s car was located in a shopping center, half an hour away from an adult presence.
Upon arrival at the place of the event, a car designated by the eyeglasses was visited, which was placed in the position of the sun.
The first passenger seat was a child seat where the baby was present.
The sun was right on the child’s head.
The baby’s voice was loud, intense, and his face was reddish and discolored.
In view of the fact that the vehicle owner has not been found on the spot, the immediate decision is to leave the rear-view mirror of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the baby.
The child with all the seat is removed from the contact vehicle, and the doctor is appointed.
The child was breathing a sequencing, the skin had reddish and hot, so by the time the doctors arrived, the guards on the stove had a cold compression.
At the scene, almost the doctors and the parents of the child arrived at the same time.
The father of the baby, putting the exposed window on his vehicle, remained aggressive and the doctors did not let the child in.
A discussion was conducted with the parents and it was explained that children under the age of seven were prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left with health and life under dangerous circumstances.
After a discussion, the doctor looked at the patient and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanation about the incident and threatened with judicial action about the glass of the car.
During the discussion with the parents, there was no indication that they would be in a mood for alcohol or that they could otherwise harm the child, so a four - month - old baby was transferred to care for both.
The material of the case has been sent to the prevention department of children's offences, whose staff will assess the responsibilities of parents.
The RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, the car left in the sun will burn very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their lives.
Members of the LPF may request the resignation of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Feding Federation (LPF) could in the near future ask the president of the federation to cancel its current leader Kaspari Poni, the agency LETA told the former vice president of the federation, Janis Dhenis.
Danis said that given the criticism of Poni and his activities in the Federation of the last days, several LPF members have signed a letter calling for a meeting of the LPF, which is the highest federal institution and is entitled to decide on any issue raised by the LPF.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the style of the Ponies management, as well as his going to the Olympics in Riodeganeiro, which, in turn, did not have the opportunity to go to the Latvian record of the Olympics by the swimmer Alonas Ribakovas coach, German Jakubovski, is regarded as an unethical and undeserved act of the President.
Dhenis pointed out that members of the LPF, as well as General Secretary of the Federation Aivars Platonovs, have done great work for the development of the federation and sport type, but the contribution of the Federation is not highly appreciated.
The day that worked in the federation for a long time explained that the federation was an attempt to concentrate power on one person’s hands.
Consequently, members of the federation could also request to amend the regulatory statutes of the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Dhenis explained that dissatisfaction with the work of the Federation has been a long way off, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "last pillar" of the federation in order to decide that action should be taken.
The former vice-president of the federation said that during the course of the Pones, training and judicial councils were greatly reduced.
Dhenis explained that in order to ensure faster progress and decision-making in the federation, members of the LPF had decided to run the federation at a meeting of the board of directors of Pone and two Vice-Presidents.
However, as Janis acknowledged, Pone has joined the federation.
The members of the federation relied on Pohn, thinking that this would make decisions more quickly in the federation.
"He betrayed the trust of his fellows because he practically took power in his hands by taking a non-ethical step," Jeanis said.
"This attitude cannot be one of those who should serve as examples to other sports representatives," Jeanis acknowledged.
In the view of the day, President Pone has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as President of the LPF.
The long-term LPF Secretary-General Vladimir Maslovskis told LETA that the letter could be submitted to the Federation next week and that the LPF's meeting should be held within one month.
In his view, the general meeting is "to speak about all the issues that have been hurt" and should decide on the next action.
On Friday, it was not yet informed that the LPF members were planning to convene a meeting to decide on his resignation from office.
In the meantime, I don’t know anything about such a meeting, so I don’t have a comment.
As for the fact that the members are unhappy with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the coach Jakubovski already mentioned when some dissatisfaction has been made.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovskis lost his senior coach's job, because his action was not in the interest of the LPF," said Mr.
He also pointed out that the meetings of LPF members, which reported on their achievements, had not yet received a transfer.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," said the President of the LPF.
He also explained that there was no need to play the Olympics, but to work.
For most people in Latvia, it is not clear and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in this work, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sport federation is eligible for funding, as only 10% of the required amount is received from the country’s LPF.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of international federations and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The negotiations have also been introduced and I have worked to make one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Mr.
According to the company.lv portal data, in 2015 the revenues of LPF amounted to EUR 249 444, which is less than EUR 36,000 in 2014.
Approximately 40% of this amount was generated earlier by the targeted grants, which increased by around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
Also, in the form of membership, accession and other annual contributions, the LPF received around 43% of revenue, namely EUR 109 442.
In the form of donations and donations, the Federation received another €35,532.
The former federal expenditure, compared to 2014, increased by around EUR 70,000, by totaling EUR 263,876 in 2015.
The main expenditure was not linked to payments of money to persons, to material expenditure, or to salaries - EUR 215 733 is indicated as "other expenditure".
Money payments for persons spent EUR 20 549, while wages paid EUR 14 684.
If the 2013 Federation had concluded a positive balance sheet, the 2015 LPF would have concluded a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) has requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the participation of LPF President Pone in the Olympic Games of Riodeganeiro, where the Latvian swimmer's coach Ribakovas Jakubovskis has not gone.
Latvian citizens have not suffered from the explosions in Thailand, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AMM) on social website Twitter.
The Ministry pointed out that according to the Latvian Honorary Consul, information available in Thailand was not available in Latvian national explosions.
LETA has already announced that the AM calls on travellers to follow regularly with information on the political and security situation in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia’s AM calls on people to avoid meeting places, to be particularly attentive and attentive, while staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travellers who are in or are planning to go to Thailand shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the planned plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to follow regularly with information on the political and security developments in the country, as well as to make sure that the place of residence is safe.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Given the unstable security situation in the country, AM does not recommend going to the border of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces on the border of Thailand and Malaysia - Patany, Jala, Narathivita and Sonkhla.
In the emergency situation, the Ministry is calling for immediate contact with the consular department's daily telephone degerant +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.

The football superstar Lionels Mesi, however, decided to return to Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July, Argentina's second year of hard work failed at the final tournament of Copa America, which decided to re-recognise Chile's overcrowding.
Immediately after the loss, Messi announced that he would end his career in the state union, but then it was reported that he could return to the election.
"I took seriously the opportunity to leave the election, but my love for Argentina and the election is too big," 29-year-old Messi said.
The Spanish Grand Barcelona jumper Mesi in national unity ranks totaled 112 in games won 55 gates, which is the best indicator at all times.
Together with the adult team Mesi has not had much success, although in 2014 Argentina became a world champion.
Mesi five times named the world's best footballer.
For the Chinese Jean and Dzelinas double-dwelling Rio 20 km away.
China's champions Vans Jeans and Cai Dzelins fought double-power in the 20-mile Olympic Games of Riodeganeiro on Friday.
The Olympic champion was crowned Jean, who took place in 19 minutes and four seconds at the end of 12 seconds in the siege of Dzelin.
On the other hand, the bronze medalist Deins Bärds-Smits, who lost Jean in 23 seconds, was beaten by an Australian salesman.
The householder's favorite Kayu Bonfims corrected Brazil's record, but he missed five seconds to climb up to the honor of the pedestal.
Jean got a bronze medal in London four years ago.
He also has two silver medals in the world’s championships at the same distance.
Judo Coach Baskins: Nikiforenko is not a real heavyweight.
Latvian Jewish trainer Olīg Baskins acknowledged with appreciation that Arthur Nikiforenko Rio was not able to survive the worst of Azerbaijani sportsmen Ušangi Kukauri in the Olympics.
In practice, it was not minimal if it could have been applied to any method or party.
We've already predicted it will be.
He was prepared to do the right thing, and he fought the right thing, but the enemy was stronger.
The opponent was well - known because Nikiforenko had fought him twice and both Arthur had lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arturus has been artificially transferred to the worst category of weight to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been taken over, therefore Arthur used the European heavy weight category.
Arturus with a weight of 100 kilograms fought against a hunter who has 140 kilograms and who has already won several times in serious tournaments.
In the heavy weight category there is a very little random moment.
If the weights are light in the years, they are very rare.
On the question of whether Nikiforenko would further be better at fighting one level in the lighter weight category, Baskin answered with a confirmatory answer.
I think it should - Arthur would be better to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are willing to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Elections Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote that took place this year, with which the Chavismo will be at the power plant until 2019, people in the streets of Caracas continued their journey of their coming days as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news, because I saw the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who was resting in Altamir's field on Wednesday.
The area of Altamira, located in the east of Caracas, was at the beginning of 2014, an asylum-seeker epicenter protesting the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever before in order to achieve the referendum this year, people throughout the country no longer show such energy.
"I would like a referendum, but for security reasons I would not participate in protests," said Deans.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board, Tibais Lusen, comments that the government is delaying the revocation process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has set up to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
The recent referendum initiative had much support - in the phase of the signature gathering, people had not yet seen a couple.
However, when attempts are made to block the efforts of the government to protest, the number of myths coming to myths is likely to be smaller.
"Some people focus on the creation of food chains, while others are afraid after 2014 arrests and death cases," said Cipriano Eredia, opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that, until the next stage of the referendum process - even more signatures for the country-wide collection - will have to be expected by October, those who oppose the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to remove the courage of the Venezuelan people by letting them believe that the vote is practically impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he is left today, he has an obligation to declare general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a communication on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure respect for the constitutional rights of Venezuelans.
"The last steps to implement the President's resignation referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediately, thus promoting the rapid and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it said.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the board of the election from 2006 to 2009 that the changes are not expected so soon.
"I think that this year there will be no referendum unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government were violating the law, but as a result, they would achieve their goal if people did not protest.
The opposition called for a wide-ranging demonstration in September. First, in Caracas to ask for speeding up the process so that the recall could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital this day.
The government will feel the pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanca, on the other hand, feels that it is not possible to wait that long in this situation.
"They should respond to the Lusena communication faster and stronger, because it practically kills the referendum," said the expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to get the event to take place faster, but another group wants more time to organize.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signing campaign will be low," Salamanka said.
For this to be activated, the process of reference must be supported by 20 per cent of the national voters, who are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are confident that even if the revocation takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be disappointed.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government concludes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Director of LNSC shall be replaced by A.Pukēti.
At the extraordinary session of the council of the Grand Vardas municipality, the majority of Members supported the resignation of the Director of the Grand Vardas Sport Centre (LNSC) of Ainara Pučīša from carrying out their duties on time while the service was being checked.
In the near future, it is planned to clarify the circumstances in which a sports product visitor wrote to the municipality.
In other words, during a training visit, the LNSC client received a head injury.
The centre of Sport is located in the municipality of Lielvardes.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and the possible appeal of the client to the court, the commission of the Vice-President of the Council of the Grand Duchy of the Municipality of Vitas Volontes was set up.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sport Centre and to deliver an opinion until 16 August of this year.

Opres for seniors sports are holidays.
Today, the sports festival of the Ogres pensioners was held in the stadium of the centre of Sport.
At the Senior Stadium, the organizer of the Sports Development Centre of the Ogres novad, Sanita Tauriņa, who had prepared a special programme for participants in the Sports Festival, was expected.
No individual results will be evaluated this time, but participants in sports holidays will be divided into four teams.
"Each participant will meet as a result of the team," explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to do four tasks - basketball speeds, Eiffel tower building together with memory game, florbola activity stadium, summer skiing.
In order to successfully launch all four weekend programmes in the disciplines, participants had to perform the heating tasks - "Unity circle", "Rinko dance", "Implementation", and three stadiums - with horses, to carry out the hairstyle and the elements of Badminton.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports holidays carried them out with joy, smile and touchy comments, while others supported them.
Special excitement led to summer hiding, which took place in the event of the organizer’s clothes.
The competition was followed by volunteers from the Ogres novad Sports Centre who conducted the tasks, fixed the results and failed to heed the advice.
There was also the symbol of Ogres Čikurs, who inspired participants in the sports holidays.
Ogres' seniors proved to be pretty successful, attractive and good in sports.
The Green Team representative Peter Zeps, eight times in one minute, was exactly impressed by the change in the basketball, only for one successful year, his team member, Janis Staudžs.
In the mountains, pensioners are active.
In the excursions, the buses are always full, and there are about 300 people on the ball.
"Two times a week we meet at the Family Support Centre, where we can play a new, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioners Society, Janis Staudžs.
At the end of the sports holidays, all participants received thanks for their participation at the Ogres novad Sports Centre, but the biggest benefit is fresh air, good weather and shared time.
2016/2017 Premierliche nr.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Note: it is not just Alan Smith's prediction, but our journalists' councils in general)
Item 14 of last season
The chances of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will once again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how much "empty is glass" under Tony Pulis' leadership.
However, Jeremiah Pius sold 88% of his club shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in the arthetypically safe hands, which the bummeikers immediately made to be a favorite in the unwelcome first-relevant manager.
The situation has inevitably changed Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some Journeys on the north-west in Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, while not spending much time, turned away from Kenya Jacket services.
Pulisam, however, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, and the entrepreneur has also expressed his desire not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the beliefs of the club or start a non-sustainable affair," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we remain Premierly and then get further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
This is the success of Pulis, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to look forward to a fast cut-off table up to find out that it is an extremely difficult task, given the basic work that has recently invested in the other teams near the table.
In order to move beyond the 14th place of the past season to get up, there will certainly be more work to do.
Only Aston Villa, located in the lower corner of the table, enters the lower gate, and is worth recalling that on average, the Christmas Albion made less than one stone by the door in 90 minutes, almost or the worst indicator of the division.
They failed to obtain doors 13 of 38 games, and to enter more than one gate in only nine games.
Out of their 10 wins in no game could get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a total of 34 doors were obtained from standard positions.
There is no wonder that the Hawthorns team ruled dissatisfaction, possibly most visible after the shocking 0-0 was not separated with Villa at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams had better protection indicators - although no club has been able to list the four sideguards.
These safeguards are often not sufficiently assessed, especially for Johnny Evans, who wants to be Arsenal, given their recent crisis against their own players.
The Northern International team experienced a great start in the European Championship, and Albion will be spent in a thorough manner to sell.
Ben Foster's doors are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Fletchers, much like Evans, showed to a large extent that he was still able to play at high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs was underrated.
It is disturbing to all parties that the long and lyric story of the future of Saidi Berahino is still unclear.
In fact, the prices from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still maintain peace and Mark Hughes is ready to wait.
After the last season you are close to the liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to act.
The climber is certainly talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, he has been dragging him here on one side, here on the other, for a long time, it has been apparent that such relations are not working.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents for the change before allowing the former member of the UK U-21 selection to go, but his 15 million marks worth walking with Diafro Saho disappeared a few days before taking over, claiming that he had passed a medical check and that everything had been agreed, but he had a back injury, which meant that he was going to leave the beginning of the season.
This creates a great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondon, who in the past season looked very well at the moment, but he has to improve the performance of his nine gates, especially if Ricky Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Anicébi and Stefan Sesegnon in the retrospective also seems strange.
Pulis in all his career is miserable famous with his slow new players moving up and three tracks - Jonathan Leko, Sam Fild and Taylor Roberts' appearance in the last season of the last game with 1-1 with Liverpool, almost or will become a norm.
He will return to those who have already tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old semi-trailer in general participated in five games during the previous season, becoming the first to be the first to have a family player, who is also highly valued in the English football system.
Mets Phillips, with a 5.5 million deal with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he's the only new player who took part in the first week of the game.
This would not be a safe saying if the end could be rather urgent.
"All," Pulis told the past express and Star about what would be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the middle players of the field and the players in the front positions.
The goal is, we know what we want.
They may appear to be much more difficult than expected, mainly due to uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could determine how they began, with seven to a great extent winning games before the difficult games with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time the pressure on Pulis will become less or unbearable.
And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Tata Steel UK is closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised pension changes
Apart from Tata Steel UK, the pension authorities said that the scheme could be restructured without involving the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) by increasing the company's ability to close the rescue transaction.
The British steel sector's pension scheme has a commitment to the amount of 15 billion sterling stamps and, after calculation, at least 700 million sterling stamps deficits, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of the rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the business of Britain, which employs 11,000 people, to secure the future after negotiations with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Pensions regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the UK business with ThyssenKrupp, the German Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the retired president, said that this scheme could avoid the PGF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well funded in comparison with other schemes, with a deficit of up to 300 million pounds for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its liabilities.
Johnson said that the authorities recognize that it is "not real" to the joint venture or to any Tata Steel Uk buyer to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than the addition of the PPF, he added, where workers should be subject to more favourable conditions.
The sources of Tata Steel warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel goods since the negotiations on the future of its business in the United Kingdom began in March, and this has been the case as a brief in negotiations with the British Government.
Kušik in Chaterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian Conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the Tatar Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chaterie said that the negotiations on pension restructuring were moving forward, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We speak to different stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc.", said the Times of India in Chatterj.
There is an opinion that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not lead to business forwards.
The willingness to cooperate in the negotiations on restructuring the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include the direction in which annual inflation-based benefits increase is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, and the limitation of future pension payments to the minimum laid down in the law.
Johnson added: "The executive and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the decline in the market for recent securities in the same way as in other UK pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme is able to provide benefits at the proper level.
CBS commenter blends Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti all the length of the competition
Canadian radio organization CBC Olympics commentator caused anger on Thursday evening, mixing Michael Felps with his rival Rayen Lohti.

If the owners of the apartment are very poor and specifically spoken about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and to arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing from this year will be able to receive any multi-dwelling house, only the condition is that the facade of the building is mandatory.
Only a series of multi-dwelling houses could be used in advance.
The largest housekeepers will be able to organize the meetings of the owners of the apartments.
The important problem where this process is currently being collected is that there is a need for 67% of apartment owners' consent.
"The previous programme required 51%", says SIA Project Manager Toms Cīrulis, LNA.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because, in most of the collections, the number of owners of such apartments does not go away," said project manager Gints Ločmelis of the house service APSE.
The largest housekeepers in Liepāja - "Home service APSE" and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plan to upgrade at least 50 multi-dwelling homes by 2020 during the new planning period.
They do not rule out the possibility that it will be difficult at the start of the work to convince people to vote for the renovation work, but the attitude of the population to each project implemented should be improved.

"In explaining what will be - but I have signed them," says the oldest Vita Iselniece of the most energy efficient buildings in Latvia.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, it can't be that the side is making up, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says Janis.
The ALTUM representatives of the financial institution have proposed an amendment to these provisions.
They explain that with 51% of the number of votes in banks, it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experienced during the last programming period.
In most commercial banks there is a need for two-thirds of the owners of apartments.
As one of the recommendations for housekeepers, the head of the European Union Fund Section of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Anda Lagzdini, mentioned the opportunity to introduce citizens with the existing examples and various benefits that will come from the renovation of buildings, such as energy saving.

"And he was going to do it with a self-inflicted spark," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada, Mike Kabana.
In the video, a man dressed in black masks in English and Arabic posed threats to Canadians and promised to act on everything they have done to Muslims.
For about three hours, using facial and voice recognition software, the Canadian police have been able to recognize this man.
It was 24 years old Aron Driver.
He has already been under the supervision of the Probation Service for the celebration of the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
The judgment of the Court of Justice prohibited Driver to continue to do so and also to participate in any radical organisation.
However, the authorities did not until then consider that the Driver could create a physical threat to the environment.
When the police came to his apartment in Stratroja, Ontario, the new man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the guards tried to arrest him, but Drivers, sitting on the back seat, had a spark.
In order not to allow the detonation of the second blast, policemen shot the new man.
He's dead from the trauma.
The cabometer driver is not rigid.
The neutralized terrorist father, Wayne Driver, in an interview with Canada’s television, said that his son had turned to Islam in his teenage years.
It had helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol at first.
Yet, Aaron was a troubled teenager, who had a long history of motherly death.
Just when I saw the video today, I wondered how far he had gone.
I didn't feel that he was so radical.
"But I also didn't know that he's so good at speaking Arabic," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police recognizes that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been quite different.
Radeviča will go to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian lighthouses.
The former Olympics and the Elegant Ineta Radeviča LTV in the Olympics said that the performance of seven sportsmen Lauras Ikaunieces-Admidės in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the sport had a trauma.
On the other hand, in the blast, Laura’s rest was made with a good leg, not as a left-hand stand.
Radeviča pointed out that it is comparable - just as a person who can write with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidia in view of the trauma is not bad.
Radeviča discovered that she has not yet contacted Ikaunieci-Admidini, but actively followed with her beginnings and felt with her.
Ineta learned about Laura’s recent trauma and expressed support for the sportist, pointing out that the discount did not begin to create safety shields, but showed the character and the spirit of the fighter.
In other sports, Radjeviča considers the Olympic legislation to be very high, so one of the Latvian sportsmen will tell you that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She recalled that even when she was driving to the first Olympics, where she played the 13th place, it was called a tourist, and it gave rise to negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," said Radevič, recalling his experience in sports.
She said that it has always been important to have someone in the courts who would give the energy of coexistence.
Radjevič himself will, however, be a tourist this year - she will be going to Riodežaneiro next week to support Latvian athletes at the party.
She points out that she will definitely go to the athletic contests.
Ineta Radjevič was awarded the title of the European champion in 2010.
In 2004, in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places in the distance and 20 positions in the tri-soils, but in 2008 the sportsman did not start in the Olympics because he was waiting for his son.
In London, as mentioned earlier, Radeviči was in the 4th place.
In the walls, the film "Quanta Code" will appear with physicists in Kašteev's main role.
The film's annotate says that in parallel to the electrons of the Kaštjevs lab, there is a dreamer, a teacher, a socialist and a civilist thinker, a man and a father who is looking for a connection with Visvarano.
The film hero himself pointed out in the Latvian TV broadcast "Rita Panorama" that he had had an interesting experience.
I've learned how to top the movie, how to film it, how to record the sound.
"And really fantastic work," said the physicist.
He recognized that the film had become two years old.
The main controversy with the directors was about the name of the film.
I'm categorically against this name.
No quantum code.
"There is a secret which, in the film, could be known and is all clear," added the associate professor Lu.
Kaštjevs admitted that he liked the film’s premeditation to live right in the evening of Murjan’s free film.
They are organized by friends from the "Siegli" fund, and these cinematics will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand, four people were killed in bomb explosions at the sight of tourists
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in popular tourist destinations - a series of bomb blasts were caused by the loss of four and many people were injured.
The first two explosions took place at the resort at Huahina on Thursday evening, next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that one Thai woman was injured in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions occurred in the southern cities of Phüket, Tran and Surattān.
Two bombs blow in Phycoseta in Patonta and two more in Phannu province - in the tourist region north of Phycoseta.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have exploded in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanačaroens, the official of the Royal Police Department of Thailand, announced that the explosions are not related to Islamic extremists and are considered to be local acts of sabotage.
"It's still too late to make conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty people."
After a small power bomb exploded in Huahin on 12 August 2016, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a series of bomb explosions in important areas of the tourism sector in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country as a result of which terrorists can be found.
"That is why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosion took place the same week that the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phukite and Phannu - have rejected the military-supported referendum, and in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where most of the population are Muslims, more than 6,500 people have been killed since the 2004 riots.
The event took place on the day of the birth of the Syrian King of Thailand, which is the day of the national holiday in Thailand.
In Huahin is the royal city of Klai Kangwon, or "the city far from the roots", where the royal family of Thailand is often allowed to stay.
King Bumibol was the world’s most powerful monarch.

Portugal and Besa - what we had earned before!
There are endlessly many operas that have never been scanned in Latvia.
Well, it's very rare.
However, it seems a shame if, for the past seventies of the past century, George Göršvina’s oussus Porgis and Besa has not been studied or played unless it includes a hertomatic solo number such as Summertime periodic viewing (such as ines Galante’s summer festival), individual student projects, guest shows and so on.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilized Western state, it has binding the rules and copyright licenses of the Göršvina family, which are valid for Portugal and Besu by 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, in the form of a full opinion, the author wanted all fourteen soliists to be black people.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of this opera in the United States in the race are not known and the composer's willingness to perform would be difficult.
On 6 August, the concert with four artists from the Black American soloists and their Latvian work brothers and sisters, which was created on the way to compromise, was held at the Cēsis Art Festival on 10th July, commemorating the beautiful sound of Göršvina, in which the European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gorges, the early 20th century's fashion dances, and the memorable hits of Ketfišrova's body, presented to the Portuguese people and the light of the Taurenian Besa lovers in such musical quality as would have earned a record of the history of music.
First of all, LNSO and Director Andra Pogas.
In spite of the complex spatial location of the concert hall in the park of Cēsis, the orchestra was located on the side of the view next to the view, on which the soloists and sang (and great song!) row While, the total scan was stylisticly nuanced, contrasts rich and precise in both stairwell and metal push instruments and pianos (Martins Zilberts).
Second, it's because of a great soloist team.
The charismatic dramatic baritone Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially Verdi operas.
The role of Portugal has been played several times, as well as the Krauna – he feels like a fish in the water in this opera and inspires viewers even at a concert to excite the emotional atmosphere of the solidarity of the fishing community of poor people.
Latvia Mūra in her second concert season in Portugal and Besa (the first took place in 2012 at no more than with Berlin Philharmonic and Ser Simon Retlu) was found to be a vitally plastic multi-purpose volleyball combination with dramaticly toned dark and fantastic piano in the top register.
Not by now she is one of the most famous today's Aidas.
The attractive Jamaican tennis player, James Smith and Andris Poga, originally intended for Boston's invention, is an image of the company's drug dealer Sportinlifa in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his synchronous singing and singing skills as a well-trained music actor.
Smit is one of the rare sights found in the voice that still seems to conceal undiscovered vocal opportunities as 15 years ago, when the voice of the opera happened to be found by circling it in order to smear the unicorns.
It is unlikely that even from the 24th row and the relative darkness of Jermaine Smith’s expressive tongue, it allows him to see the dusty bag in his hands even if it is not there.
How could poor Besa not follow such a mephistophilic predator, who in an empty place has to trust in illusions about the wonderful life in New York?
The role of the blood was created by Rodney Clarks, a gift - giver.
The greatest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team of Cēsu was Sonora's child born Sirina - a bold top register, skilled balance between the spoken and sung text, according to a change of voice position, a performance of vocal acrobatics and dramatism both in Sirina's delight My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized chairman's prayer, Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In the clairvoyant, Margaritas Vilson’s voice was well scanned, but the iconic Summertime itself was a little bit of a sound and nervous, with its true character being acquired in recrises.
Colorites and crafts were dug out by Mihail Chuilpajev, Rihard Macanovski, Andrim Lapina (especially by the Krabów seller on the city walls in response to Irmas Pavāres' excellent Soprano salesman in the Soprano case).
The features of Ilonas Bagels, Riharda Miller, Emil Kivleniek's pictures, as well as the roles of the distinguished investigator and white lawyer Ivo Martinson, the director of the Cēsis festival and the actor Juris Šagars, were unexpected.
In the spatial concept of the Kairiša concert hall, the corridor worked on the steps, the soloists - mainly in the proscenium, rarely coming up or going down the stairs.
In a sufficiently dynamic activity, a small commissary situation made the maps in Latvian soloist hands.
Their presence, however, is quite an explanation.
First of all, some soloists played several epic roles (sometimes created difficulties in tracking the identity of their audience).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Portugal and Besa, in the discussion of phrases, a replica that is easier to track with the scenes ahead.
Listeners were very supportive of the titre machine in the nuances of the opera.
The weather was not low and the first part of the concert was low for quite a while.
However, it did not stop most of the audience from staying until the end to cheer up the artists.
Nine evenings are quite a time to start full-length operations, especially if a longer journey from Cēsis is expected, however, opera Portugal and Besa have returned to Latvian music and will probably become one of the most exciting music experiences this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it ran out in the evening and in other acoustic conditions.
In the field of Riga, the man was afraid of the children with the worms.
Yesterday, 11 a.m., at eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received a message from a frightened grandmother who was upset that a man with a cow was in the street of Lomonosova, in a child’s field.
The lawyers immediately responded to the call and to the scene, where this man also met with a worm, who at the time of the incident was in a very large amount of alcohol - 3.07 miles [3.07 km].
It was found that in 1962, the man who was born had already feared the children so that they would not die.
But this time, for the sake of children, the aggressive man used the worms that sat on the child’s field.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the criminal proceedings initiated on the violation of the civil order, which is manifestly disrespectful to society or to the free movement of persons, disregarding the generally accepted rules of conduct and disrupting human peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to two years or by the withdrawal of short-term liberty, by forced labour or by a penalty of money and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation in the Olympic Games usually use guest accreditation.
The presidents of the sports federations usually come in for a few days and use guest accreditations that can be changed, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the agency the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, a wide-ranging survey was conducted following the statements by the Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakovas coach, German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment the coach decided to go to the Riodežaneiro Olympics, the leader of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone, while the coach had to stay at home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brasil had come with coach accreditation, which the President himself said surprised, because "there is no place in it now."
According to Vilcinja, only two federation presidents - Pone, as well as the leader of the Latvian Federation of Vieglattics (LVS) lived in the London Olympics.
The Olympic village is home to sportsmen, as well as the administration of the delegation of officials, such as coaches, doctors.
Thus, it is likely that London Ponem was also accredited as a coach.
"The former presidents of the federation come as guests, and they have different accreditations - they come for a few days and then use someone else," said Vilcinja, explaining that the president of these federations is also not living in the Olympic village.
Mr. Riodezaneiro arrived at the end of July and Brazil will be left at 13 a.m., so he will probably be the most important of the presidents of all the national federations.
It is noteworthy that Latvia started only one day in the swimming season – on 10 August.
Latvia Riodežaneiro will be represented in 11 sports games, and the agency's LETA calculations show that the president of the six or seven federations will be driving for the four-year most important competitions.
Sálitis will be in Brazil on Saturday, President Igo Japiņš will host the BMX matches scheduled next week, President of the Latvian Windsörfing Federation Ansis Dāle to Riodezaneiro planned to fly on 16th August, when the start of both Katija Birzule and the President of the Russian Federation will be over, but the President of the Russian Federation Dzintars Urbančiks - the day before.
The next week, President Karlis Krēslaiņš, of the Latvian Shooting Federation, also planned to arrive, when the start of the shooting by Dainim Uppelniek has already been completed.
The president of the Latvian Judo Federation, Raymond Rublovskis, at least during the Latvian sports competition, did not find Riodežaneiro, although his arrival was planned, but the Latvian Canoe Federation is currently not the president, but there is still a conflict in Latvia's founding society, and its athletes apply the Latvian Olympic Committee to the international competitions.
Meanwhile, the president of the Latvian Volaibola Federation Atis Drynītis and the head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to settle in Riodjegnairo.
Vasiliev is evaluating the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, book writer, lecturer and collector Aleksandr Vasilijev is very often visited in Latvia over the last few years.
He recently evaluated the competitors at the end of "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016" and acknowledged that, unlike the Russians, the Latvians may boast of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved by silicone and botulina injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Aleksandr Vasilijev said that for years the President of the jury has been in the popular beauty competition "Mis Russia".
That is why he was very interested also in evaluating the participants "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016".
In requesting different standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilijev stressed that Latvians and Russians have a completely different figure: "Krevija beauty competitors have a more double breast than Latvian competitors."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and fried, and can also boast of natural beauty rather than the wonders performed by plastic surgery.
That is why I particularly congratulate the participants in the Latvian beauty competition with their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasiliev has great plans.
At present, the exhibition of the fashion historian's collection "Privacy Nature" is viewed at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, Livonia's palace, the exhibition "Kasu clothes 1860-2010" is viewed in Vasiljeva.
Vasiliev was so fond of Ventspils that he enjoyed the hospitality of the city for a few days and walked along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
It is especially now that there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, here is a real haven of paradise.
"In Latvia, spending time and rest is a pure pleasure," the fashion guru acknowledged.
In addition, on November 23, Alexander Vasilijev opened the Old Museum of Private Fashion.
Please help!
Please donate to our son, brother, for the treatment of the baby.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God that there was an opportunity to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, at present there is no possibility of fully covering the cost of medicine to the forces themselves.
Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11-year-old carpenter who was diagnosed with brain tumors at the end of July.
This year he graduated class 4 in the elementary school of Milzkalne with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
Looks like everything worked for him.
A healthy, lively, unrelenting, diligent and active boy.
Always funny and nice.
July 26 will be the memory of our family.
During the last few weeks, I was diagnosed with nausea, headaches, but I was sent to the abdominal virus by doctors.
And at first it seemed that it did.
Because whoever could imagine that such "innocent" symptoms of guilt are much more serious than that of the mind.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
Rapid fluids in the brain, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a tanning operation to rejuvenate the excess fluid, as the breeder is practically not available for direct surgery.
It is also not possible to determine whether the farmer is charitable or malicious.
Next state-paid plan: start broadcasting and see what happens.
Like in a bad dream - we're going to experiment here, we're going to look at the results.
Fortunately, Rinalda’s results of the investigations were shown to the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He took the surgery, and it turned out that he had to operate immediately.
The tumor causes enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the farmer is charitable or malicious in order to develop a plan for further treatment.
Before long, the parents chose to go to Spain to save his son.
At a fantastic speed, Rinald and his mother, Evie, were in Spain on August 8th and operated on August 9th.
A very difficult operation was performed, more than 6 hours in duration.
The operation took place at the Santa Elena clinic.
Most of the tumours were removed, reduced the pressure, obtained samples of analysis.
Rinald is already on his way out of bed and as a regular teenager, asks for fri potatoes in the evening.
The results of oncology analysis should now be expected.
Thanks to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated promptly without receiving a full payment for treatment prior to surgery.
They agreed that the remaining amount would be paid, only requested EUR 10,000 for the first contribution to operate and save Rinalda's life.
6 000 euros were made available for the sale of machinery, but the other amounts needed for travel, living, hospital first contribution was made to borrow from the radio and friends.
But at least 24,000 euros are needed to account for the first stage of treatment in Spain and to deliver the money we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health so important, surgery.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The disturbing signs in Ukraine raise the question: What about Vladimir Putin?
The truth of these claims has been debated.
Ukraine rejects them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The open-ended analysis group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday questioning, but quite little to delay Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or for misinterpretations for political purposes, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's opposition forces broke the electricity pillars that were supplied with the Crimean Power last year, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea is still the current issue, although there is little doubt that the Ukrainian government will sponsor the scenario of such events.
Whatever happens, the images found by open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturdays - before the expected attack.
It shows how heavy weapons convoys move across the peninsula, including missile systems for the protection of the coast.
Russian escalation is disturbingly known
Some reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea were already planning a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be a very high coincidence that it was just expected to happen at one of the most stressful times since the annex in 2014.
In order to make it known at the end of the week, Mr Putina has undoubtedly taken an even greater interest in Ukraine by choosing to use this episode to the extent that it is also real, to the greatest extent possible.
Analysts point to disturbing parallels in the way Russia dealt directly before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers provided a mandate for members of the Crimean Voluntary Opposition Forces to take part in a semi-station that Ukraine was still in control of, only to discover that they were actually Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists did not work in the Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "protection" of Russian ethnic citizens in Ukraine, which he said was being attacked.
He organized a convoy of aid to a region that, according to NATO, was only a threat to Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina planning to do in Crimea?
Some have said that only Moscow is planning another military intervention.
The battle in East Ukraine has intensified, just as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this apparently parallel could be the point where fear of military action is to be introduced, not of actual action, - it will give Putin short relations with both Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor of the University of New York, who investigates Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of small importance as a point from which military action against the East Ukraine, which is bordering the part of Russia rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small possibility if the Russians are really planning a large-scale offensive," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe the classic strategy of Russia in creating pressure."
The international peace talks about Ukraine, which was once a mechanism with which Putin made contact with Western leaders who ignored it because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly viewed as ineffective and irrelevant.
To suggest that there is a threat that the conflict can be erupted again, Putin gives us a new idea for the negotiations: to get her out of the abyss.
"It is the standard Putina tactics - he wants to try to start from the force position," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted, I could do everything much more, much worse."
Getting an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the Crimean tensions, it was not important to continue the negotiations by letting the other parties convince them to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does it really give him?
First of all, it allows Russia to continue to be strengthened as the world's capital, although its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having veto rights regarding Ukraine's sovereignty, maintaining the country under Russian control to a certain extent.
This can also benefit Putina's long-standing hopes for a wide-ranging agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, under the favourable conditions of Moscow, of course, also by ending Western sanctions against Russia.
A number of households have said this since the worsening state of the country's economy in 2014, mainly due to a decrease in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since the invasion in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called upon the Western Empire to join him in the great coalition against extremists.
However, the Russian leaders may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term of office expires.
The Russian officials are based on the view that the next President will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although apparently friendly with Russia, is still considered unforeseeable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered "to be looking for solutions, not for conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it is wise to close the possibility window to get something done quickly.
However, unless a broad agreement can be reached, Putin seems to be satisfied with keeping Russia's weak neighbour in what is to come.
The earlier version of this article misdirected the year when Russia invaded Crimea from Ukraine.
This took place in 2014, not in 2013.
When the convention arrived on the road, the White House devoted funds to the fight against Zika virus
The Obama administration said Thursday that it would divert 81 million US dollars from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the development of Zika virus vaccine, because Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
Silvija Matthews Barvela, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in a letter to the Congress, indicated that without the funds transferred, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Research and Development Authority would remain without money to fight the disease of cancer transmission until the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine should be stopped at an important time, as Mayami increases the number of cases of Zikas in the country.
Last week, 7 350 Zikas virus cases were reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to the disease control and prevention centre data).
Ms. Barvelas said that 15 babies were born with Zika virus-related birth defects.
A virus may cause anomaly and other serious defects in the children’s babies in the brain.
The spread of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has raised political rates for the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton stopped during the campaign on Tuesday in Vainwood, in Miami, where there was a local outbreak of the Zika virus, and pressured Congress to return from a five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republics of Congress have been controversial in most of the year's Zika virus issues.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on the use of the money.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the Democrats blocked the consideration of the proposed measure by the Republicans when US$ 1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against Zika's virus, but included conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds to family planning for the provision of contraceptives in connection with the virus so transferred by birth.
Because of this road, the White House in April was forced to transfer 589 million US dollars, which was intended to fight Ebola virus, to fight Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Ms. Barvela said that her department had spent most of the money and that by the end of August it would be spent in full.
"The failure to take a decision on emergency financing for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the work of the important vaccine development and taking up other valuable national programmes in order to avoid this delay temporarily," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats agreed to this statement to transfer additional money to the Republicans to the fight against Zika virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Nensija Pelosi from California, a minority leader, urged representatives of Poland, the representatives of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the continuation of this measure.
"All possibilities are exhausted, and now we are looking at the National Institute of Health," Mrs Pelosi said.
Mr. Raine's advisors say that the transfer of funds is a step that had to be stopped a long time ago and which Obama's administration has withdrawn in order to get the maximum political benefit from Zika's virus problem out of the way.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that the vaccine against Zika virus has started clinical trials with 80 people, and hopes to start the second phase of the Zika virus epidemic in early 2017.
However, as officials stated on Thursday, an immediate additional funding study will stop.
Barvela said that she would target the fight against Zika’s virus $34 million from the National Health Service for the search of medicines to treat other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Research and Development Authority that supports the development of medicinal products and vaccines in response to exceptional cases in the field of public health.
This money will come from several accounts, including US$ 19 million from a programme that grants small-scale heating subsidies to families with low-cost benefits, and US$ 4 million from drug-related programmes such as opioids.
Even as Barvela said, additional money will only be sufficient for the next month, when agencies come to "reasonably reduce their activity" in the fight against Zika's virus, if Congress does not act.
During the last four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent 60 million US dollars to help the states protect pregnant women, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their readiness to fight Zika virus and 16 million US dollars to help establish data recovery systems to quickly detect microcephalus and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thailand's leader links attacks on tourist sites with constitutional changes
The leader of the Thai Hunts called on the public to be patient on Friday until the investigators found out what was behind this week's deadly bomb blasts in Thailand.
General Prajuts Čan-oča, leader of the Huntas and Prime Minister, said that the criminals had been "bad people", protesting against the new Constitution, which was approved by the voters at the referendum on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they acted before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bomb blasts in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuketa and Huahina, in the sight of tourists, killed four people and injured two people.
The authorities of the country of origin state that the attacks on the burners are linked elsewhere.
Analysts argue that the aim of the bomb explosions was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the highlights of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"In order to be motivated, explosions and firefighter attacks, the Hunt's claim that the post-referencing situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuks, the senior researcher in the Human Rights Watch.
These attacks create discreditive effects from the authorities, terrorize society and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thailand's rescue service staff provide a five-day bomb explosion in Huahina.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or to the alleged Islamic riots in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks on "local sabotage", not terrorism.
A strong political symbol for the time and location of the selected attack.
The event took place on Friday, when people had prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Syrikat, which is considered Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions swept through the royal residence in Huahin, about 125 yards from Bangkok, where there were also most injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and grant military powers even if the government is once again under civilian control.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Mureis Hibert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people who were not satisfied with the vote.
The demonstrations were "precisely coordinated, but clearly aimed at creating fear and confusion, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at the popular Ereván sanctuary, mostly a Chinese tourist.
The Thai officials linked explosions with Uighur fighters, who were unhappy with the return of more than 100 Uighur to China.
General Prejuts, who has been running together since 2014 when the business was abandoned by the civilian government, said that this week's explosion "pains the hearts of Thais."
Why now, when the country gets better, when the economy gets better, and the tourism sector gets better?" he said.
We need to ask why and who did it.
Golden reaction: as looked at the historic moment of Simone Manuele
This evening, I try to remove from my shoulders the burden of the black community, which is something that I am not with myself simply in that position.
However, I hope that all of this will be gone.
I am more than happy that I can serve others for inspiration and, hopefully, by different forms of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to be the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term in the black swimmer makes it look like I should not be able to beat the gold medal or that I should not be able to skip records.
It's not because I've been working as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win like everyone else.
The fight for students - the protection of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) in Colombia
Two years ago, the 16-year-old Sergio Urrego moved away from the Shopping Center in Bogotá, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting the song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Ardy's Wicked World").
Her death was the beginning of the clashes that emerged in Colombia this week, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the wider political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, his mother, Alba Reijes, filed a complaint against the officials of the school, accusing them of excluding her only son when it was discovered that he and his class had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court handed her a favourable judgment, inviting schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories for the movement of gay rights in Colombia. A year ago, that movement celebrated the decision to legalize the marriage of a single woman.
However, this week they faced a conflict in their struggle for equality, because the Minister of Education, who is openly gay, had a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to circulate sexually exposed content from the porn magazine, spreading to people the talk that it was part of the textbook issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perody's doing it.
Although the Ministry offered to help schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them focus on the rule, it did not try to impose the standard rules.
"What we want for schools is tools to deal with conflicts," Mrs. Perdodia said in a Thursday interview.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, will be conducted by a group of partisans.
The political coalition of the opposition to the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church have been extremely quickly mobilized, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting one sex union and gender change.
To make it even more difficult, a government delegation participating in the negotiations with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and the equality of L.G.B.T., calling for more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks for 42-year-old Perodiya, Colombia's rising star.
They have demonstrated pairs of posters and some have also threatened to address violence against them and their partners, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perodija maintained a wonderful peace throughout the week, trying to correct the mistake and relaunch the debate with constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who are just going to open," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and a very unique time.
She also pointed to the relationship between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the FARC transaction, which would be a turning point for the country, they have to think about the rise of the conflict, she said.
"Or is a state of peace that promotes inclusion or exclusion; or is it where everyone has the same opportunities?" she asked.
Even though this week she was not happy to be the target of insults and beatings, she is glad that students in Colombia today can take an example from her and think that they can try to be ministers one day too.
"I am very important that they are peaceful and realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perody.
We can't wait for a new suicide to begin to change something.
To be saved in cybersecurity - The New York Times
"ASV is looking for ways to keep hackers per piece from the polling holes" (new article, August 4th)
Minister for Internal Security, Jehs Johnson, says Obama's administration is thinking of additional protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Kiberdraudi in various manifestations and recent revelation that foreign forces may be national states are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, demands that the federal government pay further attention to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps consider it a part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist in the election and offer the assistance, advice and management of the Department of Internal Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should start as quickly as possible.
The author, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a high-ranking member of the National Security Committee.
A boy in prison in Pennsylvania, this week's the third case in the parks
On Thursday, after the car accident, a boy was killed and taken to Pittsburgh's hospital. Quick assistance service and park officials say this is already the third accident this week in the U.S. parks where children have suffered.
A child whose name is not revealed was taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidvailda and Soukzona Park in Lajdžonjer, Pennsylvania, said a rapid relief service representative in the Westmūrland area.
The three-year-old boy, who visited with his brother while he was being helped on the spot, was on the news, e-mailed by the park representative Jeff Krušor.
Krušor said the attraction "Rollo Coaster" will be closed at the time of the investigation.
Children in Aidwaild should have at least 3 feet (91 cm) long and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) should be assisted by adults.
The withdrawal, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it was examined in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the boy’s health status.
On Sunday from the neck of a young boy who will be killed by driving from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Kansas, a 10-year-old boy will die.
Three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls who fell from more than 30 feet (9 m) of height were delivered to the hospital during the annual market in Greenville, Tenesia.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe World War II will not visit a shrine that honors the memory of the war: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that Prime Minister of Japan, Sindho Abe, will not attend the annual World War II celebration of the so-called Tokyo shrine, which honors the memory of the war.
Thursday, however, Juji reported that Abe planned to send a ritual gift to Jasukuni on the anniversary of the ceremony on Monday.
The temple also honors the memory of 14 Japanese caravans, who are only convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the military of the Kingdom of Japan.
Both have not visited the sanctuary since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited it to show respect for those who love his birth.
The new Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the sanctuary, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada - near Abe, a supporter of the Pakistani constitution of Japan - has visited Jasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that Minister Masahiro Imamura visited the temple on Thursday and said he was praying for the peace and prosperity of Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have become more strained following the growing presence of China's coastal guards and other country ships in the vicinity of the South Sea, which is called Senkaku in Japan, and China as Diaudzu in China.
Sustained two suspects in planning the terrorist acts of Rio Olympics: police
On Thursday, the police arrested two people who are suspected of supporting the Islam nation in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The police had already arrested 12 people before the operation on Thursday, all suspected of collaborating with the Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were arrested and later released.
The two prisoners are Brazilians on Thursday, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in the history of Brazil with known fighting groups, the government reports that because of the Olympics, the country has become a more up-to-date target, in particular because of the participation of the countries fighting the Islamic State.
Its fighters are controlled by individual Iraqi and Syrian territories, and the US-led coalition has launched air attacks against them.
The group has supporters all over the world who have been questioning and harassing civilians.
Charges against the murder of the newly suspected French priest
In the course of the French priest's murder investigation against the man arrested earlier this month, official charges were filed, and Reuters reported the source of information to the police on Friday.
The 21-year-old suspect is being investigated for cooperation with terrorists, and he has planned attacks on people, a source of information mentioned.
The man was contacted by telephone with Adele Kermich and Abde Malik Petitdjan, who stopped the church service in Sentetjên du Ruv, West France, on July 26, and turned his arm over 85 years old Roman Catholic teacher Jacques Amelam.
Both the police were alive.
The suspect had left his home near Toulouse, on St.
The new man, who had not previously been convicted, admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigator that he had left on the next day because he had no good relations with Kermic and Petitdjan, said a source of information.
The investigators are trying to determine whether Kermic and Petitdjan were members of France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, a pre-trial detention was applied to the Petitjan brother.
Doruss de Vriess undergo medical examinations prior to transfer to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club Guard Doruss de Vriess arrived in Glázgova, as he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hope agreed on conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead Club leader Brendan Rodgers is looking for an experienced center to compete for the current first number by Craig Gordon.
Tommert Rogers trusts the old de Vries, since he has worked together with the Dutchman at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they played under Rogers’ leadership in 2011 and promoted the right to move to the Premierly.
He has changed the form of sailors to join "Vilkam", and since 2013 has been City Ground.
During his career, he also played in Scotland after the season of Diunfernline, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in Istandwerk ended with a convulsions, however, Pars experienced a double agonist, being "sended in triumph" from the highest level before losing Celtic Scotland.
The guard under the contract had still remained a year in Forest composition, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
Big business giant Macy's announced on Thursday about his plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step to help the store chain get ahead of the potentially complicated problem: in America, it claims, there is too much online shopping time for too many shops.
Macy's regularly reduces its shop portfolio, often closing several dozen unfavourable shops immediately after the annual holiday season.
However, the summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, the stores chain appears to have taken a much more aggressive position than many representatives of the retail sector in terms of reducing its turnover by adapting to the highly variable procurement environment.
Losers and buyers go to Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant reports that it plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has a lot of reasons to try to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has particularly influenced the appearance of e-commerce.
In general, the wholesale category has become more difficult because buyers are increasingly choosing lower-price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashions such as H&M.
These factors, due to the short-term difficulties such as the increasingly less international tourist spending and the weather conditions for the season, which Macy's has put in an unstable situation that has already reached more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volumes in the last quarter fell by 2.6 per cent, with a very weak improvement, taking into account the very bad 6,1 per cent decrease in the annual cut found in the previous quarter.
The retailer’s income was 5.87 billion US dollars (7.64 billion Canadian dollars), of 3.9 per cent less than the previous period.
Macy's said it would cost about 1 billion US dollars per year.
At the same time, the closure of such a large number of shops could be considered to be the recognition of the retailer’s collapse.
However, the company's share value decreased by 17 per cent on Thursday, which shows that investors consider this move to be a pro-active measure that sends out Macy's stronger future.
In the sense that Macy's reduces the number of shops, it should not be surprising.
The retailer's general director Terijs Lundgren has already said that there is just too much store in the chain.
The leaders of the highest level said some time ago that they had adopted a new strategy, with a special emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops, trying to achieve greater sales volumes in the already profitable trading venues.
Jeffs Janete, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed at Lundgren's place since 2017, said in his statement that almost all the shops that the company plans to close are those in which sales volumes and profitability are going down.
"We are aware that we do not yet receive adequate return from investments in these trading venues and often there is no level of purchasing experience that reflects our efforts with Macy's brand," Janet said.
The company announced that it would present the list of shops to be closed at a later date.
Macy's said that there is still a decision on closed stores and that therefore it is not yet clear how many employees will be fired.
The retailer does not completely withdraw from the main markets where he currently has shops, but it is thought of closing the shops that are less active.
This journey will most likely not be for the managers of shopping centres, which will be charged with large tenants such as Macy's, to attract and maintain their shopping centres and other smaller shops.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles can be "a lot worse than leaving your dog’s toys", given how many bacteria are going to get into contact with.
The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with a screwing hook, with a wobbly hook, with a pressurised hook, and with a straw.
Each bottle was used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as dirty as the dog’s toys.
"On the basis of 12 of our verified water bottles, we found that the reusable drinks may contain a large number of viable bacteria: more than 300,000 colony-shaped units per square centimeter (KVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
The maximum quantity of microbes was found in bottles with debossable caps, more than 900,000 colony-shaped units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)
The bottles contained microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood clotting.
The bottles with pressed corks were the next worst with 162,000 KVVV/vv.cm., while the screws with screws contained only a little less than 160,000 KVV/v.cm.
"Drinking water from such bottles can be worse than eating from your pet's stomach," is listed on the website.
A better scene is observed for salmon bottles where only part of the bacteria in the other bottles were found - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because water fills up to the lower part of the salmon rather than adheres to its edges and thus attracts moisture-loving microbuses.
The microbes present in the salmon are described as "mostly safe."
"On the basis of the results of our test, we recommend that we choose a bottle of salmon and a small number of bacteria, both because of the presence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles will have fewer microbes without leaks and difficult to clean.
It is recommended that the website wash bottles after each use, ideally with a soft packaging solution.
Religion needs to become modern or forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently appointed Hilaria Clinton as its president's candidate.
If the results of the last polls are really the same as the polls, then in January America will innovate its first president - a woman.
Last week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Terez Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from the European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been raised to know that through education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any area of professional activity.
And today's new girls can target a number of existing role models in the field of leadership.
So is the fight for equality finally over and over in the long run?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but the leadership of women in the field of religion remains a controversial issue.
All right, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be involved in a diacone in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church invited Libya Lein as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
As long as the women's rabbinic movement has been ordered in the Jewish movement since the beginning of 1970 and the conservative movement since the beginning of 1980, the concept of rabine in the orthodox Jewish Jewish order is still very strong.
In November 2015, the American Orthodoxal rabine Council, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the orders of correctional women in the rabine, published a sad message that the concept of female rabine is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as a candidate for the presidency of democracy, the group of American leaders of the upright rabbinic, who opposes women's orders, launched a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between time and time?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long-lasting traditional values.
This shows the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who oppose women's orders do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
However, it is in this way at a price that can be overcome by the preservation of traditions.
And the price of such a unilateral thought can be paradoxically suggested by the tradition of itself, by removing the traditional community oxygen it needs to maintain life.
In the book "Auguste Shooters", in World War I military history, Barbara Taczmen stresses how dangerous it is to give priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the Red Bull Tragedy."
Until the beginning of World War I, when the war departed from the close of the battle to a more severe artillery that was broadcast from the distance, it became beneficial to hide the warriors as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their scattered uniforms with long-lasting bridges and bridges.
However, the French soldiers still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy to reach.
The proposal by French military minister Adolph Messim that the armies under his command could act in a similar manner was taken with ridicule and opposition.
The red whips reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists were not ready to give up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister for War Affairs Eigen Etheen spoke on behalf of France.
"Refuse the red kisses?" he cried out.
Sometimes!
"There's an inexplicable and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colors," he later wrote in Mesim, "there must have been bad consequences."
Leaders of faith who fight for the inclusion of women in the leading religious roles could be included in the same lats.
By focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question, "What changes are needed to make religion flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also take away all the talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
To show that men keep wearing bikes when it comes to religion can be traditional, but, as evidenced by the burial of red bikes, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in Britain and a student of orthodox rabbinism in Jesivata Maharata, New York.
The children of Rojas municipality gained new skills in the camp.
From 1 to 6 August Rojupes took place in the centre of the Youth and Children Initiative, the "Varaviksne bridges" camp, during which participants creatively manifested, sported, and acquired new skills.
We arrived in the resort on the day of the closing day when the children were very excited to see glass jars.
Ms Folkmane, a youth specialist at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, said that this was one of the activities that the participants enjoyed most.
It was also a great pleasure to visit Einār Kalniņa's "Mazbebriņi" table.
The most common thing for children is lasergravier because it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer is slightly applied to the child.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be taught in school if he wants to work at the table, that is, the main thing is mathematics, in particular geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with brains than with muscles in this profession.
There are individual orders in the small shop, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know others better, the participants took part in various games, as well as in the joint formation of the "herbs".
On Wednesday, the voyage took place along the sea from Paradise to Žocene, and natural materials were collected, which were later used to make maps.
Sports games were also desired, which are of particular importance to participants.
We went to multi-dwelling homes where we had a sports and recreation area, we played football and a network bomb.
Children like sports activities, we have lots of kids playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporting.
Girls enjoy a more peaceful job.
On the next day, with the help of self-contained mass, decorative burskins, which can be used later as seal holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose to go along with it, and one evening was dedicated to the front.
Board games were also played, each one could show his knowledge at the time of the photo orientation, where after the tickets objects were to be found and photographed with them.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also dyed mandala - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one role that will be enjoyed by all - one that is closer to sport, another that creates.
"Now it seems that everyone is working with a glazing glass," said Mr. Folkman.
In conclusion, diplomas were issued on creativity, sport, as well as assistance - several children helped directly in economic work.
The name "Varaviksnes bridge" has been created because it includes children from three associations - Rojupes and the Centre for Children and Young People's Initiatives, as well as the "Strops" multifunctional centre of the Municipality of Rojas.
They're the same bridges.
If parents think something faster, we take ideas; otherwise, they take it from us.
We share our experiences.
This year, 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30, and it also met," said Mr. Folkman.
It's been going on for the fifth year.
It began in 2010 when the Social Service of the Rojas municipality decided that in summer, multi-child families and families of the poor need to organize camps.
However, the situation in Roje has improved since this time, and the camp is now intended for the residents of the municipality who come and operate youth centres.
The goal is to spend a lot of time on it.
Two camps took place in the past, and 20 children participated in each of them, while only one camp is being held in the country as a whole.
Similar activities take place over the next year.
The children painted, painted glass, came to the villages of Einars Kalniņš, who taught the burning of trees, the creation of machines from trees, with figurines in various forms.
There is also a new technique - enkaustica, it is coloring with hot wax cream.
The teacher, Ilze Šelkova, was in charge of the work of making polymers, making balloons and various cracks.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandala from bees, pigs, linens, leaves in the autumn.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre in winter works from 3 p.m. to 2 p.m., but in summer - from 14 p.m. to 2 p.m.
"In Rwanda, 15 children visit the youth centre on average," said Mr. Folkmane.
She emphasises that great support is provided by the council of the municipality of Rojas, which understands the need to grant funds to children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may be a season ticket only if he signs a behavioural contract" and agrees not to criticise the club's social media.
Even if we recognize that everyone has the right to their own personal opinion, the publication of dissatisfaction comments on such websites will not be beneficial.
In the field of administration, a fan was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former senior police inspector Clif Iger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career police force.
The letter goes on: "I must inform you that the award of the seasonal ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign the "Acoordinated Agreement of Conduct" (ABC), which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing negative or misleading comments about club or club representatives on all kinds of social media websites, or any other behaviour that might be considered as antisocial."
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket fee, which was not received either, and two days later a letter was received by mail.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I've been too much "twisted" by telling others who are funny."
Rising holidays on the coasts of Dalmatia
What do you mean, "freaky"?
I am going here from all power," said Colina, former U.S. Marine Commander, who had just taken off a 25-year-old wheel drive along some uneven central part of the Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except the splashing of fresh and salty sailors scattered in the hostile mountains.
Some riders sing the hymns or the number of infantry pieces to make it easier for them to be on the mountain.
Colin's friend Petia recommends "The Little Engine That Could" (The Little Engine).
Others may be in a position of quietness, thinking about what it requires to get to a trance similar to that of wheeled riders.
Kolina is laxative rather than multimodal.
Driving some gardens for her in front of her is like living behind Hju Greens as a movie at the beginning of "The Four Weddings and One Babys".
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxury" yacht and cycling along the coast and islands of the North Dalmatian Croatia, organised by Freedom Treks.
Walking in summer heat at a mountain spot such as Croatia may not be consistent with every sense of horror, but it says that the North Dalmatia is easier to get out than South Dalmatia, our seals are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we did not notice that could have provided us with an accumulator loaded with e-vesipide.
The luxury part of the deal is our swimming house for a week, the brand-new Melody.
At the end of the trip, we can beat our bicycles in battle at our guides Ivan and Ivan and the ship's back in the blue water, without contacting sea horses, axles, and other people on the narrow stone strips, which the Croatians call the beach.
In June, the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agree: it will be cold enough to cool, but not cold.
On Melody there are masks and breathing tubes and some kayaks, if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the sails.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massier - I'm not joking - will have already put on our beds, added our minibarian stocks and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says it is very important to climb after the wheel ride, and we learn to climb on our beds or on the shoulder-chairs on the upper deck with Antonio bar, who is always ready to prepare one of our cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and semi-duty crews, not an abandoned super yacht, but a stylish little cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petia belong to a group of friends from Washington (Colombia District): with sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s grandiose and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something more enriching, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is sailing and cycling holidays in Provansa, and every afternoon the air connects the competing Facebook publication pingpong rally.
The element of holiday adventures can be surprised, because our schedule is nothing unless a particular regime is defined.
"Broast and dinner are in eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started our journey from the beautiful old Trogir port near Split.
One ship’s call indicates that the buffet is open, while at the end of the second meal, it invites you to observe silence and listen carefully to the information.
"Good!" is a cultural context which may have been lost everywhere, but not in the British continent.
What a difference - the feeling has already taken turns, the jokes seem like an overcrowding race, until Ivana issues a day-to-day tour map, but we all seem to be frightened by the snorkeling, the outflow and the profile with the rise and fall, even though any other would be a surprise in Croatia's ride, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
The full balance is not recommended.
Ivans conducts the informational meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to end with a dozen different peoples, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, Americans and British who easily sit at tables where two speak English but one - German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Rising promotes the public, and the only competition is inside, on its own, and on its own.
I do not recall when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we're headed for Ivan's wave.
A small increase is a slip that should not be mixed with an inequality that is a good thing.
Matatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Go one by one, catch a distance, and they are not competition.
We're on the coast of nine.
All right, five pairs - I'll forget you're on vacation.
Take a lot of water with you.
From Trogira we take a two-day cruise to the north through Kornati Archipelago, where we go almost all along Dugi Otok - in Croatian "garo island" - and after a short walk through Telašcica's nature park, we admire the rock and salt lake, where seawater flows through the underground canal.
It says that those who earn it by its power become younger.
If we do, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we return to the south, moving from the continent to the nearby islands apparently by chance.
Most of our journeys are on empty small roads across the country with wide views of the sea and a variety of plants: olive groves, wine gardens, axis plants brigades, Mediterranean flavors in the air and countless ponds in the air.
As we move forward, there's always a moment, but when Ivan stops, there's always a big shadow, and the small pieces are like a prize for those who have arrived faster.
Sports and public activists spend a lot of time on bicycles at the weekends, and they know the rules of conduct by sending warnings in a row and leaving free space so that motorists can carry out fire drills much safer.
"You almost drowned," one wheelman said to another after the heavy car driver decided to do the roasting maneuvers on an invisible curve and quickly stopped.
The brakes worked happily.
Ivan divides us into three groups each by a fraction for short journeys on the main roads, with Ivan in the back to provide and "give the tempo", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all gather, get off the bikes and get on the road with our bicycles on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows he's not talking to a group of kids?" asks the Swiss wheelman, when we're standing on the side of the road and waiting for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be spent in leisure.
In the city’s view, the Roman forum and the sea eagles that play music that tastes like the play of the sea threat are discovered in Zadar, through the tunnels in stone and open in water.
Zadar's famous sunflower perfectly accommodated during the time between the main meal and the shower, and after dark entry we return to the sea shores and observe the wave-operated lights on the sidewalk of the glass, which is actually the dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning begins the journey to the famous Biograd resort, the orchestral song is no longer more than just smell.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from driving.
The tour of the afternoon view in Sibenik, where we look at the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as the time of the cruise on the peaceful Zlarina island, while looking for its local precious coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is about to take the saints into the shadow of the attack.
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gathered at the temple of the Lord.
The French security forces are on high alert, as thousands of Catholics are gathered at the annual celebration of the Festival of Lourdes in the shadow of several acts of terror.
Each year, on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the Pyrenees ’ Hill to observe the birth of a new Mary in heaven.
This year’s celebration takes place when Catholics have shocked the death of an elderly French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who entered the church in the north of France during the month and turned his arm around him.
Jaka Amela's cover-up took place two weeks after a Tunisian man -- the investigators say he's been radicalized by the online video material of the jihadist, -- broke out with a cargo car at the Bastilia Day Festival in the city of Rijjara in Nice, killing 85 people.
After three major attacks over 18 months, many French people will be cautious about public intervention.
The number of tourists fell dramatically, and the authorities argued that this year’s number of pilgrims could be quickly baptized.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say even the flow of visitors' applications has been observed at the last minute.
Approximately 25,000 faithful arrivals are expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium, and about 200 of the Eastern Christian branches - a delegation of upright representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they have not allowed themselves to be present.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Kristians told the agency of the AFP, describing prayer as "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life will continue," said Matthew Gvinars - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to the concerns about the security in France since the attack in Nice, a number of wide-ranging measures have been repealed, including a large-scale cream market in the northern city of Lillian and a European racer on the road to the cheese that was to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to call back applications," said Fabjens in Leggesne last week, a priest responsible for the official pilgrimage.
"On the other hand, it seems that the attacks have mobilized the believers," he said and announced the influx of applications at the last minute.
The head of the local hotel workers' trade union, Kristian Zhel, confirmed the "high interest" of the holiday after the attacks.
In 1858, the place where the young Mary appeared in the cave to poor sheep of Bernadette Subirū, there were extremely strict security measures.
Approximately 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been deployed to protect the site, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosive-searched dogs.
In addition, the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three at the entrance through the safety barriers.
Katrina Simkoksa, who traveled from northeastern England to Lurdu at the beginning of this month, described enhanced security measures.
"Up to Thursday morning there were armed guards in the sanctuary, and then through the gates (with metal barriers) could only go through one, as well as searched sums," she said The Local.
"This all upset my three children who have gone to Lurda, and it was hard for them not to beat them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It didn’t hurt my impressions, but it made me sad that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calming down.
The process of opening Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving on to the sanctuary, it will start and end in the sanctuary.
Other measures include the closure of airspace for flights above Lurda, the closure of the streets near the traffic sanctuary and the replacement of waste urea against transparent plastic bags.
Minister for the Interior of France Bernars Kazeneev will examine security measures on Saturday.
For the year, about six million people go to Lurdu, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic holiday destinations.
Many visitors visit relatives who are sick or with disabilities and who come to swim in a well where Bernadette has seen Mariju by drinking water medical properties.
There Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a bit unusual", taking into account "the threat, as root, seems to be being sought in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
Francesua, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that, in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civil matters was "a little tiring."
However, if it all calms down, it's good.

The opening of the waterbird hunting season is imminent.
Every year, on the second Saturday of August, the season for waterbird hunting is opened.
This year it will begin at 13 a.m. at 16:00, so the State police call on both the hunters and the citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterbird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas but also in public watercourses, and although weather conditions do not change as in the next few years, it is also permissible for vacationers to be used together with hunters.
Both the hunters, the vacationers and the watertights invite us to be particularly cautious in the vicinity of the lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, without endangering themselves or others.
As it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year, in cooperation with the National Forest Service, will also be able to strengthen the control of hunting.
Law enforcement will focus on the compliance of arms and ammunition with the law and will ensure that hunting takes place without alcoholic beverages and the effects of an aprivileged substance.
The police recall that half-automatic firearms, whose total capacity of patron rooms and warehouses exceeds three patrons, are prohibited in waterbird hunting, including attention to amendments to the Arms and Special Means Act, in particular paragraph 22 (91), which states that persons with large firearms or large-scale firearms registered for hunting or sport, and within a short period of time when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, have the right to keep arms and ammunition on the vehicle during hunting, but they must be located as safely as possible, so that the furtral or other packaging in which ammunition or weapons are placed, shall not be visible from the vehicle during the period of the flight, to the roadside, to the roadblocks and to the roadblocks, to the roadblocks and to the roadblocks.
The police call to take care of their safety during the hunting season and, if you consider violations of law or any threat to security, call immediately for a telephone call 110.
In any event, the legislators shall be prepared to respond to the information provided by the citizens.
New Caledonian coast satricin 7,2 magnitude earthquake
New Caledonian coasts crashed 7.2 magnitude earthquake on Friday, reported seismology, indicating that tsunamis are no threat.
The Earthquake epicenter was located nine kilometres deep, 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia at 1.26 p.m. after Grinička time (see 4.26 p.m. in Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
At the close of the ocean, the tsunami has indicated that there is no warning or recommendation for the potential tsunami threat to the region at present.
"The landslides in this region, as it is known, are not unfounded, nor is the last time of activity not found," said the oldest seismologist Phil Kamins of the research centre "Geoscience Australia".
It could potentially be found on Vanuatu or New Caledonian islands, but I doubt whether it is so powerful to do the job.
New Caledonia is located in the "Fire Circle" - in the Pacific Pacific Tectonic Activity Zone, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open the checkpoints at the borders of both countries, which were closed at the initiative of Venezuela a year ago, the presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro, announced on Thursday.
The initial border points will only be open to passengers.
Starting on Saturday, every day from 8 to 20 will open five border points.
It will be possible to open the road to transport after the President has indicated that separate international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded.
In August, Maduro was forced to close the border in response to the attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
In July this year, the Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border twice because of the economic crisis - the Venetians who came to poverty tried to cross the border to get the first necessary goods purchased in border stores.
This was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

"Facebook" refers to anti-fighting advertising blockers.
The world's most used social network Facebook has voiced a warning like this, making it clear that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will also have to watch advertising.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising are falling.
Facebook has now made it known that it is well understood the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also come to live with them.
It is true that they will be provided with tools to choose for themselves what kind of material they are shown to them, reports the BBC.
"As we provide people with more and more control options, we will also start to show advertising to those who use advertising blocking software," said Facebook commercial vice president Andrew Boswarts.
In other words, users will be able to choose which type of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that they think are interesting.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't belong to them or interfere with content enjoyment," said Boswart.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but the reduction of their banner exposure is also measured in billions of terms of money.
According to BBC information, advertising blockers are used by some 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business Facebook revenues from the advertising were 6.2 billion US dollars or 5.55 billion euros.
It should be noted that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their novelty flows.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove or at least limit new streams with "in the walls" headlines, after which the "empty" news is actually hidden.
Asphalt work will take place at night on the Freedom Street; traffic restrictions must be calculated.
In this phase of the Freedom Street from Bérzaune Street to Gustav Zemgal Street, asphalt integration works will have to be carried out, so drivers will have to calculate limited traffic during this phase of the street.
As the agency LETA learned in Riga, traffic restrictions will begin at this stage from 21 a.m. tonight and asphalt work will last until 12 August at 7 p.m.
Traffic towards the South will be driven through tram tracks.
Drivers must calculate limited traffic at this stage and the additional time spent on the road.
The municipality calls for understanding to deal with the restrictions imposed and to comply with the rules of the traffic organisation.
The refurbishment of the roof began in the capital's main streets - on the freeway from Ray's boulevard to Lächpläs Street and from the air bridge to Juglas Street, on the island of Lächläs, on the island of Avot, on the island of Juglas, on the island of Kölės to Malinas and on the island of the Great.

This month, the National Police Office for the fight against Economic Crimes (ENAP) has been informed by the Gjibovsk VP representative of a bookstore held by a Riga commercial company for 20 years by the Agency.
The current information shows that a woman suspected of having committed illegal activities for several years and that she has suffered a total loss of more than 130 thousand euros.
Given that the company’s officials did not closely follow the cash flow and rely on their employee, they learned about the current machinery only after several years.
VP ENAP policemen this month arrested a woman of birth in 1963 and had a seizure in the company.
In connection with the incident, the criminal process of engagement has been initiated if it has been committed to a large extent.
The law provides for the withdrawal of liberty for up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.

In Estonia, Zika virus antibodies were discovered in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people will be analysed with Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have been in contact with this infection, the ERR sent by the Estonian Public Radio Organisation.
The laboratory's information indicates that Zika's virus tests have been conducted in 121 samples this year and nine of them have been positive.
The first cases of Zika have been identified from outside Estonia in Finland and Sweden.
Estonia’s health management data show that no acute case of Zika’s virus infection has been recorded in the country and in cases of flu-like symptoms, people should not perform a Zika’s virus test, but they should turn to their family doctor.
We have found IgG (immunglobulin G class) antibodies that show that at some point the tested person has been infected with Zika or similar virus.
"This does not mean that the patient has been infected with Zika's virus," explained the head of the Synlab Diseases Laboratory, Paul Nábers.
The gene of "Aedes" in Zika's virus transmission.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, in an interview the agency BNS told Auto Association Vice President Ingus Rutuņš.
Rūtīš answered with approval, whether in the car sector or in the car sector there are problems with dumped prices.
Of course.
Car purchases are different from service purchases, where handling with prices is easier.
The end result of the car must be paid in any case as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the contracting authority is incompetent or unable to establish a quality procurement, as a result, it is often not known whether it is 'purchase'.
"Or a very well-known purchase is being built to get something specific, and then there are all sorts of wonders," said the Vice President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically profitable offer as a criterion for determining the buyer, but in part the company still has a false idea of these things.
Now it is very popular - from the lowest price to the most economically profitable offer!
However, the criteria must be determined in both cases and, when taken into account and evaluated, the decision shall be taken at the same time as the lowest price.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-friendly.
However, there is no point in assessing what can be said in the monetary statement.
The points do not require the assessment of fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar matters.
It is the expected life cycle of the car, the journey, etc., and then it can simply be counted together.
"The question then is only about where the customer is interested in the scenarios?" explained Rutuņš.
On the other hand, the director of the Auto Association projects, Peter Rubulis, noted that the problems are linked to the fact that often the same person forms purchases for cars, for work and food, and these purchases are derived from one sample.
We have also brought to our attention the spare parts of the procurement sample, which was difficult to identify as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the buyer is very often lacking any understanding of the subject matter and the requirements are simply collected from somewhere," Rubulis acknowledged.
Rutuņš added, on the other hand, that is less a body that publishes the purchase because there are more problems.
"It is obvious that this is precisely because there is a lack of human resources and competences," said the Vice-President of the Association.
Latvian volleyballists do not fight for medals.
Latvian beach volleyball duets Aleksandrs Samilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņs took off on Thursday from the Rio Olympics tournament, deciding to join the match (1-2) by housekeepers Evandra Gonsalveš Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgad.
Our duet in the three cats won only one win, and in the D subgroup came to the last fourth.
It has caused quite a lot of confusion and sorrow in social networks, so we offer to look at the brightest records of Twitter.
The celebration of Riga's holidays began with the trade.
Take a look at the picture of the holiday trade in Esplanade.
"Die Reply" accuses "A unit of suicide" of losing style.
On Thursday, the South African group "Die Reply" accused Suicid Sqaud of using the film "A unit of suicide" without permission to use the group's unique appearance, calling the director to be regarded as "a bit of finely dressed".
The group's lead singer Jolandi in the mobile application "Instagram" turned to the movie director "Warner Bros", saying, "Just like that, David Ajer, you're wearing our style".
As she claims, the movie stars of the War Delavina and Jared Leto have told you that Aer was yours for the filming of "Die Reply".
"But you didn't ask permission to hug us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja (Ninja) will briefly address Ajera in this matter, but he "did not answer anything like such a little bit of shit".
Jolandi insists that Ajers has lost the scene since 2011 in the introduction of a short film "Umshini Wam" showing the South African hippop duo.
She also published video clips that prove that Aers Joker and Harley Queens have lost both singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration of Joker's image is based on the handwriting of David Bowie.
In conclusion, Jolandi voted in favour of the highly critical assessment of the film's performance.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the real name of Anne du Tuata and Vatkins Tudors Jones, received the fame with three rea studio records, popularizing the African 'Zef' counterculture.

Turkey Seeks lost diplomats for the conversion attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return with the personnel withdrawn after the attempt to turn 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavusogl said on Friday that from around the world to the time of the conversion attempt to Ankara, 208 Turkish ministers were withdrawn, and 32 have been missing "without permission".
About 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their posts in Turkey, viewing them as loyal US official Fetul Gulen, whom it accuses in the development of a government gas plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey's most wanted people.
Kavosoglu said that the US Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss its possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem for the US in relation to Turkey, NATO Member State.
The United States opposed Turkey's President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan's strong weaponry tactics after the turn, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer links with Russia.
Kavoglu said that Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two Generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two Bangladeshi officials fled to New York, and one of the Russians went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryte, quoting military sources, reported that Turkey's military attaché was also lost in Jordan.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting an official of the United States who is aware of this situation, reported that Turkey's military commander, based in the NATO Command Centre in Virginia, has requested asylum.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," Kavosoglu said in an interview to the broadcaster NTV.
Since yesterday, the time has come for those who were initially called back.
We will take legal action against those who do not return.
The organizers of the Olympic Games are trying to clear the green-colored diving pool
The Olympic kidneys, which were scheduled to be trained on Friday, arrived at a closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean green water before the first individual matches in the Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the middle of a synchronized dive competition.
The organizers claimed that water competitions are safe even after the larger pool nearby the water pool and the synchronized swimming also had a light green color.
Driving was not yet possible when the athletes arrived at the morning heating, even though the pool was finally opened at 13.00 after the local time - only 2 1/2 hours before the women's 3 metre competitions.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, but still with the green color.
The American ninja, Ebby Johnstone, who is struggling with the tramplin, told me that she only came to the heat to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote to her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp (reduce the powder) should be in fashion.
British knight Tom Deilis, who praised the state of the pool in the match for the bronze platform, also commented on the Twitter record.
Hopefully, this means that we are not as bad as we are in the last days!
Mario Andrad, the chief speaker of the local organizers' committee, stressed that the pool is safe for competition by giving green light for 3 metres.
He agreed that some athletes were watering, but he said it was the result of the pool cleaning efforts.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have said all the time - water in no way threatens the health of sportsmen," he said.
On the first day of such watering, one or two athletes complained that they had eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw the water becoming green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We re-examined the water, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simons Langford, the main water sports centre of Marias Lenka, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that he supported the decision by the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water needs to be calm so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the state of the pool had surprised the unprepared organizers.
"Chemology is not accurate science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lie down.
In the last few days, rains made the appearance of water colour in a normal condition even more difficult.
"Lietus doesn't help anything," Andrada said.
He added that the sportsmen had a dry exercise in the morning, but he acknowledged that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the change in the pool’s colour was elevated due to alkalin levels, like aquarium water may become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent green color, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because sportsmen are training in it," Andrada said.
We could certainly have done better at the start so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.

Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication
However, Shanghai and Taipei will hold an annual city forum in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, the Shanghai municipality announced on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
The High-level Municipal Officer, Mr. Hailins Shanhaja, will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced by the Government of Shanghai in his official microblogging account, Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been organised on the basis of both city rotations since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "enhance the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
The Taiwanese party has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the single Chinese principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-vens became in office in May, as a result of which communication and consultation mechanisms have been suspended.
Ma Ksiaoguang , a spokesman of the National Council of Taiwan, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations could exist while the Taiwanese side adhered to the 1992 agreement's political foundations.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experience between the two sides of the city," said MA, stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and the exchange of experience between the city should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, looking forward to closer cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vangu Ji, Ugandan President Joveri Musveni thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is a sense of Uganda and Africa's friend who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The president mentioned Tanzania - the construction of Zambia's railway in the 1970s as evidence of support in China's gift that was provided even when China itself was not particularly fed.
Museveni said that China has implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda in both investment in infrastructure and business and cultural exchange, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and in the construction of industrial parks.
He also invites the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and to visit it.
Wang She praised Uganda's industrialisation and agricultural modernisation activities and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda's cooperation.
Wang said that China is ready to do everything possible to help Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political confidence and time-controlled friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with the construction of Uganda's infrastructure and industrial parks and support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African people.
