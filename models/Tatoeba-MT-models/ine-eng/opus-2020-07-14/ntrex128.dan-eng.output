Politicians in Wales Fear to "like fools"
There was confusion among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly on a proposal that their title should be changed to MWP's (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It is because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Wallisian Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was worried because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Walysically, the twp means shit, and the pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walysian conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Walysian letter w is spoken in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire-English.
Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legislative proposal for the introduction of the amendments, said: 'The final decision on the names which Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to Members themselves'.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission welcomed the fact that the Welsh Parliament Members (Valisian Members) or WMPs were most supported by the MWP in a public consultation.
AM's proposed apparently alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to draw up a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The draft law on reforms contains other changes in the way in which the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is being debated.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long struggle with the neighbouring Greece, whose own province is Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name is a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested with Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will teach the vote.
The supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the amendment is merely a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's will be quiet, while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in ancient days there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People are socializing in other ways now and then," he said.
"Bars no longer make up the living room of the neighborhood where people go on a daily basis."
In relation to the church, he is concerned that the money that is charged with selling assets does not last long and that they are "before or after where they started".
He adds that the church could be replaced by apartment complexes full of people who do not help the neighborhood's return slots.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the properties will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who stood at the top of a 125th Street boycott of shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when Johnson’s son-in-law made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the clock game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played the game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first time in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger time game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a substitute for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which have been obtained by the church's leaders, others by the bishop.
The Council of the Congregation – the leading body of the so-called head of the board of directors – wrote to the bishop in July about the concerns that the bishop "will try to push the expenses further" to the council of the congregation, even though the council had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Haj harms 13-year-old on diving after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was diving after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group walked over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just a wish to have caught a lobster, but so he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his demands were lifted up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was fled to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It's uncertain what kind of shark attacked.
The nurse Larry Giles said in a media briefing that there was a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety purposes and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to adopt the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in style with large stores.
As part of a major effort to take on the British beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and are launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as the supermarkets search for new goods for helmets previously used for television, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees ranges also get more space with burnt areas in style with them, you see in stores like Boots.
The Supermarket also re-launchs a range of Boutique-makeup, so most of the products are suitable for veganers – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is tested in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like big stores, as the supermarket chain is taking up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites, since they both bought chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily products and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but cooperation ended with a quarrel about how to distribute the profits of the pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our selection of fires is designed to suit all needs and the absorbing environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to go."
Peter Jones' "breathing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones left "reduced", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she was leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' En star Peter Jones furiously, after she withdraws from their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says that Jones was "absolute", as the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had time for their residential product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left True, while Jones fled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would have been dealing with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all those involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods in Marlow's headquarters, which is already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the announcement from this Morning host, which is among the highest-income stars of the United Kingdom, can cost the company more than one million because of large investments in products – all from puddles to stearin for clothing and household products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and the housekeeper Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The two couples take a vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby must be a fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a member of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news store.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a meeting more, after Trump launched their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear fertilization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on atmospheric pollution have been in place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States, instead of continuing sanctions aimed at keeping the press running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve Kim’s relationship had produced positive results – the completion of the missile test, the release of hostages and the return of Earth’s remains from US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this close-packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes increase islands and kill hundreds
In the post-Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations, for example, were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboks population were outside the home, the state of national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children composes a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster plan, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly subjected to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there seems to be a lack of a tsunami, and it has probably affected the figure of death.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to deal with the victims of earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's missing infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on the way and two-storey.
But Mr. Joko's administration has been plagued by the lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr. Yoko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes, when Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is at the last minute equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League to Chelsea with a score on the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri, a small 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the remotest pillar.
The ball flew high above the field against the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and crashed into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get in the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a simple touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semilege, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker took the hill back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the middle track and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended up at the remotest pole with a left foot shot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the team game in Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15 Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The death figure of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832 reported the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many prisoners trapped in the walls of buildings that fell after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the right-hand side. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the speaker told Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by brick blocks from fortified buildings.
Police arrests a man of 32 under suspicion of murder, after a woman drowned in death
A murder investigation was initiated, after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area, who saw or heard anything about coming forward.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would like to invite everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and then heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite all, particularly the tax officer, who may have taken up something with the Dashcam, to contact us as they can have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say that they are in the process of informing the victim.
A tax officer who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but let the police know that no one has to get into the building.
He was lame when he heard what had happened.
The inhabitants are now told that there will be hours before they can come back in.
A police officer was interviewed to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A pregnant woman is coming.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 14 C.E., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car outside.
A number of officers were inside the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell will be the most recent landmark of discussion on "recasting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic, puritanic followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "slander" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to the attitudes of the 19th century and a part of the story of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against extraterrestrial pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certainly true is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing the one side of the struggle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killing and killing a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated pulse year and blood clotting near a grist on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig consumption on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had evidently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the grayet was open next to him.
He said there was a big horn with blood in his mouth.
A medical study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had helped the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My stepfather's legs were bloodthirsty and thirsty," said the stepfather, who goes under the last name "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Eventing News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan went into the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collect evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarest, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 295 kg a Welsh farmer against his tractor, entering his wife's fear of the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pig is normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
The snakes, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rains in large parts of the southwest USA
As foretold, the hurricane will become weaker, as it moves over the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give heavy rains with floods in North Mexico and South-West America over the coming days.
Rosa had win at 38 m/s, a category 1-orkan, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north of Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure exit across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture into the north into the southwestern USA.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure exhauster, which comes closer, and create strong rains in the South-West USA in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid falls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that up to 51 to 101 mm of rain in parts of the South-West USA, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storms with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert to foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform the mud into muddy rivers and the earth will create strong local winds and create dust blasts.</seg>
The nearby low-pressure miner will give powerful rains along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid rainfall and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in their rainy season.
Spreading tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperatures throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but there remains fairly warm in the troupes.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of the dramatic temperature difference through the central USA Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east regions.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate vision indicates that temperatures above the average in the eastern United States are high in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million were reported on Thursday's arresting testimony from the nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault, which apparently took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six TV stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that broke the regular programmes to tell about the late development of Friday: an agreement made by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, who gave the FBI permission to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's ruling committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh in a brittle state grumbled at her and tried to take her clothes off to a gymnasium party.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional statement that he was 100% certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available series from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many programs there are in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a series that corresponds to a struggle under the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose sentences are strongly supported by the appointment of Kavanaugh, was among all the stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of moderate Republicans issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators called on him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the ruling committee.
He stood looking down for several minutes while he was being kicked out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later, as the ruling committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would go on to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an effect because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom accuses critics of 'legislative policy' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "lying politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson, suspected of standing behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of unconscious mandrakes, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, told the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said he had admitted the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where it was said that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, the South University police and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The leader of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area of their "sweetness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per combat last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "crushed" and "in shock" over the death of Waydes.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcanic ash over Mexico City
Aske, which is spied from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after activity in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored the rumbles and cracks over several cycles.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a earthquake that measured 7.1 on the right-hand side, the central Mexico in September 2017 erupted.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police are meeting with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wanted independence, met with riot officials as they participated in several thousand rival demonstrations, marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising release vote.
A group of masked separatists kept uromants back, thrown with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later on the day when the police used their staff to keep the fights down.
Over several hours, independent groups called for "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and met with Unionist demonstrators calling for "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The vote continued to be high in the less independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted to an overwhelming degree for independence, but the vote was low, and those who opposed the ransom boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polls throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped at night on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer doubted the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for having had the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they received a sneezing, but important, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the moment, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or are in detention and await judgment for their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, picked up the protests on his phone as support for the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be more and more tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has waited for his case since last year, announced that he would put up with the election of the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to withdraw from the return of democratic values and the persecution we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, by house framed by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
Perhaps an armrest was also fired against the car at a time.
Shot from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The crews of Livingston overcrowded Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with Hibernate on the other side.
Gerrard's team has not won the race in the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in return, builds their unfavourable strips for six matches, and Chief Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chance against cash loss
Holt's team would have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct play style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he looked in to hit Craig Halket's cross-head in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could keep up with the problems of death control.
And it was under the conditions that the important goal came.
Rangers started a fresh park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the layout for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the football team, but fought to get through the home team's defense, and the mayor Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos withdrew a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was fired with the feet of the Rangers targetman Allan McGregor, and Lithgov shot outside the frame under another of Livingstone's deathball situations.
There were ongoing deliveries into the Livingston field, but were rejected, and two demands for a penal park – after Halket's arrest on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
Livingston's Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastically and surpassed the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playstyle and body are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organised defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on the toes throughout the fight.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good at Gerrard, but they played at level.
Their completions lacked sharpness – only once they had the only household – and it is a sharp awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship with the two NATO members.
Inconsistencies have arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU approach.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, held for security reasons, had a human amount of 25,000 from gathering in front of the Moscow, but a lot of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to oppose the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, who is seen as a whole of some German Turks and the hero as an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclists die in contrast to cars
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place close to the crossing between Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there was a rescuer on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car, which leads refugees from the place, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident of the slave.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his contact.
Weaving locks have been set, bus routes have been replaced, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during uri
Six prisoners were injured in a high-security prison in prison according to the Prison Office.
There was concern in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still on.
Specialized "Tornado" staff are recruited to handle the clothes that involve eight inmates and are carried out in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are involved in dealing with the ongoing unrests in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's explained around that the officers are being notified to the police and can end up spending more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the U.S. officials were summoned to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiards.
The Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flood (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure falls under Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of the hurricane Rosa move over the desert landscape in the South-West USA and create a risk of storm.
National Weather Service has already issued weather warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "Third tropical cyclones had maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to reach 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storms, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the South-West United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the next highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the Orkan Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has a hurricane force Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and therefore falls into power.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical currents Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains on parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a great risk of flooding.
"There is expected rainfall of the total 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and USA's south-west desert area," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and floodwaters in the deserts as well as earthquakes in the mountainous region.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton about 4 BST on Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police said in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on everyone who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the "wage and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the thoughtless and dishonest tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness in front of the assembly on Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally charged by Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing of his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice in affirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most competent legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republicans meeting at the polls in the Middle East.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lifetime is to be found.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, a person has reported to the Republican party the CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the number of deaths rising
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were swept away by violent waves that hit the beach, when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at the time of foaming, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the right scale.
"When the tsunami broke out yesterday, people were still engaged on the beach. They did not run the same and were sacrificed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, the slender car, tree trunks, house, the hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea 800 km/h before the hit coast.
More succeeded in surviving by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published air photographs showing many ruined buildings and shops, decorated and constructed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city of the coastal town continued on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during the Great War of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb cast over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were controlled together.
The corpses of a number of victims were found stuck under the bricks of fortified buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living here," said Red Cross in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
The board was criticised on Saturday from many fronts not to disclose that a tsunami had struck Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was sent.
In amateur recordings shared in social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately calls warnings about the tsunami coming closer to the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls off the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings at the same time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major fluctuation in communications about Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a pressing need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for aid work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The number of deaths following Indonesian tsunamis is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions employees from Dongala have arrived safely to Palu city, where employees seek relief during demonstrations set up in the farm at their account. They came across areas with extensive destructions on the road, Dosebah said.
"They told me they were so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief agencies began to relaunch the relief work, there were complaints that foreign emergency relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and workers from abroad must come only if the area in which the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the poor were stuck in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that gleam the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a nun.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under murals for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding country team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the merger of Roa Roa Hotel circulating in paragliding circles, desperately had sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted only in one grey flueben instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty tags 26.750 USD while filling in the cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stolen on Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver had emptied the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, criminal assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "back to the Brink's employee" and stole a purse that should have been delivered.
The witnesses were so many suspects who fled the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information about the identity of the thieves are requested to contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes the name of Ye.
He announced his shift on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "The creature was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the songs of Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled by "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier in the year, where he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former cooperation partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the bond line is included.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th year of a bloody return action against students.
Lopez Obador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-wing student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening up more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in field research, says investor and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. government have given notices of artificial intelligence, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030 at the latest.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within the AI," Lee said.
The increase in the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranked American Othello players, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's Department in China.
Lee recognized previous technological competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government bonds, says Lee.
"It's not China that sucks the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
China's State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' allocation of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over USD 100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national commission of security for artificial intelligence, has remained silent for several months.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old battle with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their vector when Macedonia has sought inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primary Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the vote would constitute the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
With regard to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the country's future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote and do so.
The amendment would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We are home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on the amendment of the name of the country, which would open up for NATO and EU membership, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up the front of tents which were set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with travelling banners, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would give a strong forced investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens go to the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "secure of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required election.
Another assessment by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provident Government since it entered in May last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero fights throughout Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack received a discharge on the central track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he jumped out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green suits.
He fought over one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English advance used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used its right boots to list the Brighton target man Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told the reports.
"We talked about him playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate advance in the Premier League campaign.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in that sequence deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before he led Sterling to the remotest pillar.
The Sky Blues advance scored the ball in the net, just before the face passed the target.
City fights Hoppenheim in the team game at Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drill Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take up the castetuen Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance of participating in the games for Rockies, which has played a more fight than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card seat with a 5-2 victory over Nationals Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Even though we have nothing to play for, we can go to the battle very well aware that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest enough level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet announced the launch of Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man in the square for 34 times, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is usually his holiday.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation about his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican meetings at the polls in the Middle East.
"All we've done is in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It is one of the great, great – you cannot vote on me, but you are actually voting on me. That is why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get the power back with all the means available.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "fight against and block."
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "serious and wicked and incorrigible and false."
He mentioned the senior democratic senator in the Senate's ruling committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you drop the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait right – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a space party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last in a number of Members of Parliament from Labour who have learned that we are not welcome – only because we have made our point of view known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship went out to criticize me because I disagreeed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems in which Jeremy was in disagreement with former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight-year-olds as a local parliamentary member, the meetings were just like this on Friday night.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not like that, and the promise of "friendlyer, more blinder" policy is far behind in the past if it ever came to an end.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are based on whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, as I had previously thought, I shared the political stand with, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that is really very much what I am saying – a long strip of gross messages follow the social media calling for the derogation and opposition of the requesting policy and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness of colleagues who are overcrowded every day with sexism or racism, but still struggles further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spatial organization and with each vote of mistrust or change of the rules of choice, the lot is getting smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so demanding, I'm going to be "good enough."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I set myself up to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been a council member or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country moves forward towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threats of derogation or political suitability will hold me back from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unfavoured Ayr Becomes Tophold
Two late scores may have got the final result to draw a completely not true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only uninhabited team of ten.
Finally, it was as much of their controversial defence as their better use of the chance that carried the household home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been demanding so far, and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was assigned to the war of Warriors, gave Melrose a benefit, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a kick.
Climo built Ayr's lead with a criminal park just before midnight. He scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruarid Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was dragged out of the track on the bar. When the game was resumed, Ayr moved ahead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Working Ayr-leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again took advantage of Melrose's extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a subsequent kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to hit Climo without the ball, MacPherson could follow a line-out score behind the future Ayr-klynge.
Climo followed up with a kick in the stairs and followed up with a more almost straight after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent flyers Gregor Henry to the fifth score of the home track.
Still the Game stars looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
Still the game star Ford Kieran looks like to take the step to the restaurant industry, after it came out that he has taken the director's post for an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person with his partner Greg Hemhill.
Duoen has announced that the next nine season will be the final of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of the Affiliates Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source indicated to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of the "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Swelling patrols around the main quarters of the river, covered in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings, a sea blue flag is the key.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia has been reminded of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, and the same is the year after sailing back to the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their peak for several decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has a moment, a feeling of community and clarity, and of course it looks forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will give Bolivia content in that Chile – after several decades of discussion – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatically native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to play at the court's rejection Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has not been able to cross the Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice rejects them only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in the international jury.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given up.
"The matter of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there is no nuclear destruction unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington at all.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the rival leaders.
His comments were extended by the American Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, apparently facing a resumption of the fixed nuclear diplomat over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a 'desirable dream' to continue sanctions and the US's resistance to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever put North Korea in a knees.
Washington is holding back a statement, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps against disarmament at all.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump will have a summit more.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of eliminating an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month as a preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to increase your hate collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk the blur for a collection of remarkable main clothing in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their stunning creations down to the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an overcrowding with a wide, wide shade covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had compounded lips, which reminded more about Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled divers with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a molten waffle.
And if you continue the big moods, you're lucky.
Squirrels predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the beam hat with a 60 cm wide shade, which is seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural label behind the most unpracticed hate spread over the social media has sent a new great creation down to the catwalk – a beach bag in a stream that is almost as big as the model that presents it.
The orange bass bag with bastfries and a white leather handle was the most eye-opening in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in common shops next summer. The designer has had such an influence that it is hard to ignore the demand for accessories in size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many excellent academic results behind them, and there are still a number of outstanding exams in 2018, which are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can compile and implement a tailor-made pension, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you're talking to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot only stay in English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
We can see from the latest results of the exam this year that language is the highest in statistics with most of the exams in the independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received the character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject selection at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' thoughts and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies were 17% with lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Several job opportunities in the future will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career the young choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a boost to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ from one language to another.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to achieve success, no matter what the future offers.
At present, language cannot be denied that language continues to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scotland's youth.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first match for Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season begins against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not fixed how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the planned six matches of Lakers before the season began.
"Where I am in my career, I don't need to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump's friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judges to the free seat at the Supreme Court is in vain, Trump seeks to support the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish Time) between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were strained by charges of sexual misconduct, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation was held for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the primary objective of this strike election is to create a moment for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the next week's five electoral meetings aim to "make energy among volunteers and support them when the Republicans try to protect and build the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to band up to give him a boost in his measurements," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle guest and is trying to keep the hope alive ahead of Sunday's sunglasses
After three unilateral rounds, the master's four-man dunes might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The spinning moment pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe – not least in competitions like this one.
So where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll see it a little bit as a moment," said Jordan Spieth before he held the fire.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 more points to play.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can play with three points of four possible.
Speeth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers got higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important well, which secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two blows behind two duels.
His path, which assured them of the struggle on the 15th hole, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe that the American team is still out of competition.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couples have got four points in four struggles, and it is a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way in which energy appears to flow on both to and from the wild audience show that it is them that it becomes the most difficult to beat Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory was captured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
At all times, the synchronizing of each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial against Sergio Garcia, in the morning in the four-man dunes, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and the Swedish down into a hole they were never near to come out.
Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two hold a two players are so fascinating to look at close team due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change smoothly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-person figures have also shown that Team USA has the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of the racer's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the USA on 10-6.
The well-being duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has still got four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who tried to win the poker they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four matches, but they were still behind.
Jim Fury's team should use eight points in Sunday's 12 single combat if they need to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who has won four points in turn, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cups history who have won four points in their first four matches.
The Woods and Patrick Reed broke into fourballs and then elegantly defeated a brave Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two matches on Saturday, had little genius shine, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was very excited about the morning's fourballs and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is the number three in the world.
Europe, however, has as much as they want, on a very bright day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-fold major-finder Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-earned 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and then returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the single struggles. Since Furyks currently has the pocal, however, they must only achieve unendingly to keep it.
Having been the second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a contrasting Sunday.
North Korea says they don't want to go down unilaterally if there's no confidence.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the general meeting of the world-wide organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, developing an area of nuclear testing, and by promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and the lowest unilaterally."
While Rei repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" access to nuclear destruction, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took steps gradually, but his speech seemed important because it did not simply reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a seated US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "at the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance in terms of wetting up for severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'a nuclear suppression first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us in a knees is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are strengthening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a summit more between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, negotiations would not be so solid."
Nevertheless, the tone in Russia was very different from the last year, where he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's rockets against the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year, he urged Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions are needed to remain until North Korea falls.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timetable for these actions, but said, "It's as much if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear destruction."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly, and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours after accusing him of "walking demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "a corresponding step."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps", he demanded, were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalization of Washington's relationship.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counter the growing macho culture, where you study all night long held up by large quantities of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after having held an appointment about what effects sleep deprivation has on learning.
"When the show was over, a girl came up to me and said, "Why should I know this first when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sports performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn how long sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the student's behavior at the same time.
But we think they have the right to know it - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking a "allnight" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have led to a growing lack of sleep.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and fear is good and enough sleep," he said – it contradicts even weight gain, because lack of sleep leads the brain to believe that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler last year to organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students put an alarm so they know when to sleep, and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can run by the clock and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's measurements lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers led another defeat on the run, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's independent team had to take thanks to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The holding from Ibrox was out after their first victory on stage since the 4-1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only another defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Massa beat to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangershold could not respond to.
Rangers are now smoking down in a sixth place, while Livingston hangs up in a third place after Hibernian with only the target score for the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, since the plaintiffs of Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a cast object that looked like to come from the outway section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached Betfed Cups semifinals by toning over Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, sat with the same 11, who barbarized a point of Hearts' leadership last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the fight, when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-level player's attempt went by.
A free park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halket, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped past the backyard.
Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied at all when Judge Steven Thomson recognized the Colombian's appeals for a criminal park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter game.
Rangers had only two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers-man Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibally's main team and Ovie Ejarias's dark shot.
Although the opening of the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said that he deserved their efforts alone.
Once again, Rangers could not handle a deadly situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily shoot it in the target.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibally replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave him the passport, when the player sent the ball to Morelos, but the playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingstone forced the endurance to play on their premieres with many long balls up the path from Lithuania and Halket.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the fight, but McGregor refused Jacobs with a safe hand before Litgow headed next to the target.
Rangers' alternates Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a late criminal park after having been dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Arbog: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the journal "Sunday Tomorrow": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago – if we're talking... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would, in view, lead to the device known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, which could be seen in the movie "Bells of Coronado" since 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take on these main phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans, "Stop it! Now it's happening!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immunosuppression to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of removing the immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine can be promised in patients with a number of forms of cancer.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immunosuppression to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of removing immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so they can "see" the protein named HER2, which has many forms of cancer, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "have several forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ovaries, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teachers" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.

After an inconsistency in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was bubbed off when he congratulated the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he himself would stand up as president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town introduced a Make America Great Again box, he began a thunder talk against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have been away from the United States for the longest time," he said.
SNL started the evening's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement in the Senate's legal committee on Christine Blasey Ford's charges of assault.
Even though the recordings were not shown, the comic bookmaker Chris Rock Wests drew on the social media.
It's certain if Rock tried to exhibit West by putting the footage up.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage because of its main clothing.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They raped me!
And they said that I was asleep deep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I am?" and said that he would take on his Superman hat because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want to make progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience built at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff allowed to be pitifully concerned, Variety informs with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb in the study."
West had been booked as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose present boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had arrived a few days before.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAK FOR NOT TO LET YOU FOR THE PUBLIC."
The talk show was Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just, "It's like he is, and it's totally cool."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and evicts an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, so he follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapcollege Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington long after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to bend swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs after the stereotypical macho-helt and says that the kind of TV characters means that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes there was "something wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his 31 Rose Leslie's Game of Thrones, admitted that the problem lies with him "very at heart".
"For the time being, I feel very much – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"When we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their growth?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued, "What's born, and what's related?
What is it that young men learn from television and the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the major issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that something went wrong for the young men.'
During the interview he also admitted that he would not make followers of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he was "completed with battlefields and horses".
Kit has been involved in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West since November, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother who is a thief.
The shooter recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it gave me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, like Kit's character, Jon Snow, is in love with, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, as the health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, says the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT persons is, according to a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women before or since because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staffing low data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied in Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were derived from websites and supported by the "extreme right wing".
"Little lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter account.
The published information included allegedly home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information on Thursday was posted on the network of an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It occurred during a hearing in the Senate regarding allegations of sexual assault against the high-levelly appointed Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages that Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and a direct lie," the Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these misleading and false charges is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and a direct lie."
Waters' release was quickly criticised online, among other things by former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It indicates that she does not have the right temper to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't be angry.
You don't have to be suspicious.
You must not question the accused's motives.
You have to keep your mind down."
Fleischer was able to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' seats in the mid-term election, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Where, if it's true," he tweeted.
In the official announcement of Waters, she says that her staff have contacted "the relevant authorities and the order of these misleading claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review by Johnny English hits again – mastering spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British island, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the country's new export potential become a dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction if we are concerned?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber look and the big eyes have been given his permission to make the smells renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention directed towards places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-pids Mr. Bean and a proper knife of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luxury suit that left chaos in his lap, after Atkinson photographed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a middle-aged weapon, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely overwhelming, especially now that more "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Ni also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed towards children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumpy films in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-level spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of harassment for the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been discovered, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, it's Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches you how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of rock education in espionage.
English rush back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunite with its hard-tested previous right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an obituary but well-being subjugator – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus the royal intelligence service is back in the mood of Batman and Robin, as they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, Prime Minister Schnobly is nearing the migration of the charismatic and anxious tech-billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their raging risk-filled squads: Dressed as servants, they set fire to a strange French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself familiar with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's final sequence, but how well-being and energy it is, there's a sense of children's distance over it.
Right in the middle.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to engage in a four-day work week plan with unchanged pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour said to consider a radical plan, so the English can be satisfied with a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party will obviously have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra Friday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days a week without getting paid.
Source states that the idea would agree with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbor Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It will not happen one day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the Party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day work week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously in the Labour Party.
One spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says that he is determined to flee the power back from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The Minister of Finance's plans also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour could "moment" them in the wake of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get employees in company boards and to establish including owners, which will allocate 10 per cent of the private company's share value to employees, who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 minutes if the FBI's study of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has extended the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy allowed himself to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the charges came up – and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, determined and unique."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it in the strongest way," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it would change anything."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens, and has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York’s host town is for the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and a equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time tens of thousands of people on Central Park's big plot, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival began in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP picture), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". e.g. make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does it create the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection on the web or making a Twitter store?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members towards different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and political actions corresponding to more than $37 billion, which in 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been achieved due to their actions, which amounted to more than $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group believes that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a cooperation between investors and trade-strengthening people. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with undermining can become a footnote in the history books," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised means to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to a frequently asked question on the website, which reads: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will become a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will slip and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the participants at this year's New York Festival. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be host.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy exports, says the US Minister of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, reveals the American Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, particularly where they operate on a call from the legal government, is a bid to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they will sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sleepers, and if necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that sees itself as "the voice of American energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and said that they are in the bottom and bottom.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the fact that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the most expensive choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 leadership project, which according to Trump has made Berlin to Moscow's "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion pet Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unfair competition conditions and is simply because of economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to mix outside EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party mixing in our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election in 2020," says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election after the mid-term election," she said on Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about stopping.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would like to give a strong thought to the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump known under the City Council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been in his criticism of Trump and his high-level named Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday's assessment shows that the majority of Warren's own country does not believe that it should be set up in 2020.
According to an opinion from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The opinion showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible settlement.
Other highly profiled democratic candidates, discussed in the presidential election in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Please state that he is notifying his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and sentenced to domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, after he has come home, makes me relate to other families that notice the consequences of PTSD and other damage that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think that there is respect for it, their colleagues in the country and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was sentenced to domestic violence against a woman in order to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to be in possession of a weapon in a brute state, Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police in Wasillas, tells.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum camps
18 states and District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law that rejects asylum for victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. made a party-dependent statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who is against the law, according to NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal law, has not been published.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with extensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum campaign violated a decision made by the U.S. alienation exercise in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Advocate, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "exempts from the state, federal and international law of the years."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to the principle," says the Party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on non-immigrants is damaging the US economy, since they are more likely to become self-employed and "need greater labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judges withdrew the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stand," Sessions said in its declaration of the law on 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum would solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the number of deaths doubled, the attempts to find survivors in Palu desperate
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little feverish boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort in bloodthirsty properties and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were tortured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the earthquake of 7.5, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and the shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated on the basis of intense excrement.
He had tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared it with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was massed up against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was still.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda advertisements
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that struck drums for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador in China Beijing accuses us of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to China Daily's paid admission to Des Moine's Register – Iowa's best selling newspaper – after accusing China of being involved in the 6 November congress election. China rejects the charge.
U.S. officials say to Reuters that Trump's statement of Chinese involvement in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now set up in a escalating trade war, where they have in several circumstances imposed duties on each other's imports.
China's return penalty in the trade war was to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "is addressing the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, there will be only a few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the different positions of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, even though he did not say which.
Republicans report to women in advance of the mid-term committee on the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a reflection in the upcoming mid-term election, especially from women.
The matter has put feelings in the throat, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done," said Grant Reher, professor of state science at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours would soften the anger of the electorate.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill in Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators called out: "November!" when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, it is from Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," said the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the mayors and younger voters – 18-29 – who rarely vote, despite the fact that the president could not like."
Even before the Ford's public allegations of the sexual assault of the high-level nominee, analysts had pointed out that it could give back if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"This is not only about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," says Guy Cecil, president of the Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared their views on whom they should believe in the statements of witnesses from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony in a certain or probable way, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh in a completely safe or probable way.
In addition, 38 % said that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lied during his witness statement, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After a call from Flake, the FBI now investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's court board last week that Kavanaugh was fully offended at her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the high-level nominee showed her sex to a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agency is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee complained that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company's managing director, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change it completely, so all their business models suddenly become superfluous."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a record on Medium this Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Spiritual recipient of the 1st World War Victoria Cross
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in its home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant and priest Bernard Wand won the floor on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a snowman and never learned that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two children was discovered at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "incredibly symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's ordering business.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Water of 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under severe protection from masking and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and followed with the "greatest manhood" of his people before he alone attacked an artillery and undamaged three cannons.
Lieutenant General Water was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Watern of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that made me humble."
He and his brother James Water also placed a crown after the parade, which was indicated by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Watern said that he "was very pleased to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true heroism."
MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the starred Bellator 206 and then you're refused to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose program, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the sights in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had kept awake until early morning for just this battle.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a childish film as "a kind of sick joke."
"In accordance with the law, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they were required to switch to child programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator, when he was asked about the issue.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in planning forward.
"When you think about the shipment, I think we can get it to work," Coker said.
"But the clock is six Sundays tomorrow over there, and we don't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when it was changed, I received a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're just having five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor value" over sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says he felt less worth than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't work out for him before he came into the major classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he was less likely to win OL after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the radio program, Kirsty Young, has been free for a few months because of the disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "From this day forward, the feelings of being worth less and feeling differently have been the things that have given me strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronzevinder has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for criminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three-fold world champion said he was "surprising", when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar windman last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar up and downturns when you go through so much at such a young age – he took to his first OL as a 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after receiving brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in OL 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a home audience at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the recording of the OL and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Disks runs on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 BST on Sunday.
Unsarp Mickelson on the bank of Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about it if it's not to be a sad militia.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time of the competition opened every 2 years, was placed on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk because of the master's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the U.S. center of events as usual, the five-fold winner had to act as a hero and practice his game in the hope of correcting the traps.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the Le Golf National track, where the long rough often punishs savage shoots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mikkelson at the ninth match on Sunday must meet the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has met with the new-born Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single struggles start hard, Mickelson's fight can be crucial.
Fury did not express his confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a kick on my back, laid his arm on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I guess I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it would be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson Nick Faldo's record beats most of the games in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely been able to measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven unresolved, although Fury said that his presence contributes to something infinity.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, wise, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great driving can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn by experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups' single-up can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a jump at five points over the Americans, but was just getting ahead of the goal line with a victory of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You keep remembering that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just got water," Bjørn says after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be full-blown tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophies, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Satisfied with the performances of his players on a difficult path, Bear added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that count, and it's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there alone, you're testing all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're gonna leave your partner, because he's gonna get the best out of himself."
Otherwise it looks like the opponent Jim Fury, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury has experienced himself cooking on the last day. First on the wine team in Brookline, before he lost, when Europe made "Miraclet on Medina".
"I remember every word," he said, when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When the moment has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle struggles.
We put together our team in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the return and facing Rory McIlroy at the top, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships are re-disposed
The German fleet's latest fleet would have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war, but the Germans must wait at least one year for yet the reason for technical problems and a escalating price, local media writes.
The introduction of the largest ship in the completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been launched for the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who quotes a military speaker.
The ship would have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
If they are known to have a strong cannon, a large range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest freighters is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the freighters away from the ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, according to Germany, will appear to be an overseat power factor – will already be obsolete when they are inserted, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125-fregated headlines created last year, as the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss hotel in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of key "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software error was of particular importance when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of that crew of the older Bremen ferries.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the fleet for future updates.
The 700 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition, hardware error is the price of the project, which includes training the crew, also by becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a floating €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleeting power is failing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, earlier this year admitted that the fleet "runs dry for light-duty ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the girls from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust sneakers for the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highland is trying to discover how flag bear flies use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and is followed by common flag mouse, flag mouse, long-term flag mouse and water flag mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the flag mouse during the season.
Data from NTS personnel and volunteers will also be collected using hand-held detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flag muscles and show what kind of action they are doing.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, there is a report and a map of the habitat.
Nature conservation advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal what areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of nests and the best way to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of flags in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipyards and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can be flufields, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks by pets.
The flag must not be blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecolocation technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important ports and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag bear very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect dishes and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flag museum reserve in the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's flag species.
The area's merchant, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a really good area for flag noise," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot of people who don't know about flag noise, so the work here and elsewhere can help them understand what they need to endure."
He stresses the importance of looking for flag mouse before performing maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single line can kill up to 400 dogs and young people, thus risking the elimination of a whole local population.
Flag must be at peace, and it is illegal to kill, generation, or disturb them or their voices.
Elisabeth Ferrell, who is the Scottish project manager for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to give a hand with it.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, while lawyers seek German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges of violence against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to challenge the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, wrote There Spiegel on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-double winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called, according to Reuters, "an irrevocable disclosure of suspicions about privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly held in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he had to have assaulted her anal according to the report presented in the town of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The records claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later went to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fear of recovery" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says that she will violate the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, where the event was to take place, and changed to the Italian great club Youth for 100 million € in summer.
Brexit: Britain "will for all time regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain 'will regret it forever', if it lost its status as world leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Industry Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'disquieting' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Toyotas Auris and Avensis factory produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% of them exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without a border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs at a strict timetable, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been a successful supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint employee at the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
One speaker for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "be spent a week more", as decided around the high-ranking board Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possible opposition of the President of the court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk the independence of Mueller has been a battlefield in Washington for a month.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of assigning the president through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the back went on to say he was going up.
Instead, we agreed on a Thursday meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with all that happens in the highlands.
But we need to see, and I like always keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held the press in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they're playing up to the camera."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is asking more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source: "We have seen the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will take place at the press meeting when we can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often raises questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with senior guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU workers in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS in order to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continue, and it seems that decisions are expected until the autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for a Brexit, if any, without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was quickly operated after having a little major damage to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27, obeying it from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the side line and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie a light on the sideline before putting him on a bar and taking him into further examination.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at the Vandermobilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he suffered the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for two years and is starting with her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tattles this Saturday before he left the fight, which gives him 18 tattles collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they purchase an property in the United Kingdom. The extra money is to help the homeless, according to the conservative party.
This move must dampen Corby's success by attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May today will propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom for the benefit of the homeless.
The draw will be seen as an attempt to resist Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The extra charge imposed on the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases for rent may be up to 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise 120 £ million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rising and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "split cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal will only be weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp fee to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying reasons they do not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve the "damaged housing situation" of Britain.
Corbyn has proposed a wide range of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the withdrawal of the tenant's opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functional housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it is not as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy dwellings as for hard-working British.
Too many people dream of having a home too far, and the worthlessness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimative goal" is at a time to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-story team enjoys the challenge of rewinding the club from the North East, which now has a third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at Hampden with my father, when I was a child, and it has always drawn into me.
However, that opportunity would arise only if I succeed in training clubs."
Ross' predecessor as coach for Sunderland is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success if I can get this club back in the Premier League."
In addition to the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly home to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back to it."
Ross is only three years old in his career as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month fiasco as part of the Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pulled down in the third best order and transformed St Mirren from the crackdown to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more fit now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was quite a divorce," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I did it well, served wisely, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still some kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12 noon and 1 p.m. BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., shows the survey
The heat wave this summer has increased the profits of the English public, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sales in restaurants have dropped by 4.8%, showing numbers.
Peter Martin, who is a consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continually the sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows June's patterns, where the pubs experienced sea sales of 2,8 %, except that the restaurants are more hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of drinks clearly managed the best and experienced progress similar to the withdrawal of the restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Over pub and bar chain sales increased by 6,6 % per month, while food dropped by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and large social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will cause real pain above rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August will give a hard-to-tight mood."
The total increase in sales totaled for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2,7 % in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales stakes for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion, and they are leaders in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media they hide for their parents
Every fifth child – down to 11 years of age – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows an investigation.
A study of 20,000 students in 4-9 classes reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be added
20% of students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents
Every fifth child down to 11 years of age creates social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade and forward reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the screenshot service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added.
20% of students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletic coach, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilid enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help set out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter-courses at OL in Atlanta in 1996, and who is now often a commentator for BBC, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I were to come up to it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm fast, I've learned to go back and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared its opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are slaughtered.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspiring advertisement that will show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a costume filled with hoo, to a song in which it says, "Yes, I paint myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't the more cheerful, it's my breasts."
The envelope says, "Fow it out, pump it out, feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, paint my beard."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the eyes. Many say it makes fun of the "wars" of the milk industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," one user wrote.
The breast pump from Elvie passes discreetly in an ame-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "I understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "That's an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad, a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still got married, I'd have one.
Amning made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertising directed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'girls'.
It is not an advertisement that rose or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their b's.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who are adamant say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely soundless, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an ame-bh, which gives women freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, who is partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and chickens, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we showed in a entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tents at Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid of being able to stay in the country by standing up and taking a child.
The risk of domestic mail increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household were to print fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several persons who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The management subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had purely criminal certificates.
"Approximately 80% of those who are sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we keep chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to treat children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and talking about their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those sentenced to invalidity are deported quickly.
The longer children get into custody, the higher the likelihood is that they will get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcome or escape attempt, it is heard by auxiliary workers and in reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Those who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on a child.
They added that moving to a tent town without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can bring up traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs the US, French and Turkish "commissioning forces" that they must withdraw immediately
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now at its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under pressure to fight terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been displaced since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-stricken country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing unwarranted fear", which led the refugees to get away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these domestic shipments," he said.
"They're policing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that no help will be provided to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
On the basis of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million live was avoided.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlinelines" and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from Nusrafronten, a group of exploding Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
The UN mission, Staffan de Mistura, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee to write down a post-war constitution for Syria and track the way for a choice.
Moualem has laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the legislation of the present Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the rule of law and scandals end his presidential period before time, which many liberal spectators hope for.
In what is certainly going to be "the most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers have been nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers up to 3.5 million at evenings with great news.
"It's a show that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who led the ABC Drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The chaos has a value of entertainment.
However, unlike all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can decide whether Roe and Wade are able to restore the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it is more than being informed citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's stylist jacket for $15,000 ("clothed with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
Anyway, I'd never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating crew and day-to-day surprises (screaming with N.F.L, rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're fired.
When I got caught in Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC, while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find way to the close mid-term selection of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 district receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two Congressional Districts, two congressional members are fighting for the same seat.
This recently surrounded urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last year.
Lamb stands up against another member of the Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
The maps were made, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, convicted that the old district was legally placed in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th district has launched a fight on financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice with high caution in March's special election for Pennsylvania 18th district.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but redefined itself
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's team out.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for bla.drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including economic aid cuts and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings emerged, North and Central American officials launched a summit on security and economic development, and it should have continued the last year's meeting, which is considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, topbed people made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped their thoughts on punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal on the importance placed by the Americans at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke out of a condition of anonymity.
History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible prevention of the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
According to him, Mueller will also address his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress were to come to new hands, Trump would likely be held responsible while he is preparing to meet the electorate again and in time, of course, a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is finally inevitable – and the same applies to his opponents in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in with a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the year - long bathing after that.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history moves, and the inevitable march of democracy to or from.
In the United States, there are now many of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper was able to report that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is set up or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the mid-term committee for a congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath on the table with the garden basket.
How can I be different from optimistic about it in the trunk?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undecided results in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the European League.
A broken track player prevented Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went to the fight with the faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but everything was quite a result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best team.
On Thursday, another great European evening will be set up.
We hope to get three points, but it's going to be hard because they got a good result in the last fight, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of all that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
The hold is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of retirement makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be treated, there were only a few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the study in the United Nations said that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% told them that they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can, among other things, be financed through a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have an economy to do so.
Order the legal documents: take the legal battles in the race.
Get a full power so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and sick people comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, an economic executive.
If so, you will appoint a trusted person who can make economic decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents has an acute need for medical help and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down to the letter, so you're ready.
"It is not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the '40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 02.30, as "very random."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated, after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulavesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region in a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the Central Sulawes economy, particularly in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickelluding is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowoli, which is the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster centre, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Dongala.
In 1996, Dongala was struck again by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically located in the so-called Pacific Ocean and is subject to regular earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh Province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra last March and first April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake, measuring 6.8, struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and spread destruction and panic, as the population was reminded of 2004's dying earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the rebel buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor in Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspected domestic violence, prevention of domestic violence and in order to resist arrest, according to the report sent on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he received the phone from a woman when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is a prison in Mat-Su Pretral Facility with a guarantee of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "very clearly not guilty", reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B violation that can lead to a punishment on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently being handled by Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted at domestic violence, preventing the notification of violent domestic crime and possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his deployment in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died, after a earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck south of the central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos showing the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami was approaching the coast.
Public prosecutors are attempting to get terror in NYC rarely death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment, which was finally sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the road were hit.
On the basis of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov 's intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'susply' caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent on the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both these objectives.
Several weeks after the attack, a State jury was able to present Saipov for an appeal with 22 points, including eight charges of gangster murder, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "abstaining planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "unrighteous, wicked and debased."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District last arrived in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no sign of any indication of the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he was doing well in his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag up on his hospital room, told the officers.
He has refused to comply with the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "were, of course, disappointed" about the accused's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life-long prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the accused not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's home" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians might have to "mark the press" of the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The numerous conservative MP Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been "out of now", if Farage had been Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge in creating a collection in the deeply divided party is emphasized by the fact that conservative remnants participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on the track during attacks by both Brexiters, Reminders and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the rejection, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihul, Bone announced that he wanted to break the Chequers plan.
He explained that he should have included Farage and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to get Chequers."
On the basis of its EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be somebody's subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: "If the British people had changed their mind and wanted to remain in the EU, it was absolutely wrong."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop it now, Chequers, and start listening.'
As a quick comment to May, she added: "Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage stated that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they fail to vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're together to tell them that we're not letting them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class who is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop until we have become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Imens marched through Birmingham before a totem took up in the middle of the town.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after forming the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a joke about the security problems with the conservative party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, border controls, free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all for fun.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "thinks strongly" to set up the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try in November to win a re-election against the Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been speculated whether she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the electors at the councilhouse, since Trump took over the office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to stand up to the presidential election.
Warren said it's time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Arrest in the case of shooting at LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday to an ET news meeting at 11.
On Friday they had released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shot in the head and killed by the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said according to media 247 sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and believed to have been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two-metre high third year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, after teams give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a crucial role in the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got a good start and was about to hang Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in a pit as the first one, and let Hamilton fight the traffic to the rear of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in the pit a while later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, as the Ferrari driver had to leave after some wheel contact accidentally after a double defence at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race, when in an attempt to get a quick finish he failed to change the tires to take Kimi Raikkonen's square.
He had to go into a pit at around 44, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkon secured the square.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did it fantastic all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The holding was doing an incredible piece of work to ensure us both the first and second places," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump threatened Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting this Saturday, because she insisted that she had not closed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the high-levelly nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given in front of the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unrighteous and incorrigible and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened the last couple of days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and wicked and hostile and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and play, and then they say "oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, was that you who cut it off?
Remember her answer... it was you who closed the document – "oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I didn't close anything."
Hey, just a minute.
We have closed... no, we haven't closed anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was closed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the lock came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, and I haven't closed her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who, during the election of the jury, said, "I tell you that it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defense of the appointed judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They have no means in their efforts to take the power back.
You can see the wickedness, the contradictions, they don't care who they have to fool to get power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well again after Friday's losing Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return campaign in Dundee this Saturday.
Giants quickly came forward with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were compensating at home before Dwyer brought the Giants in front of them again.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Friday fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as conquerors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer added the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy lead period, Sullivan returned home in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came forward at first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The household regrouped, and Bouchard recomparated with a beautiful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen to drive Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Aeroplanes died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escaped the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as a total after he died in order to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers would surely come down to the earth.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in Friday hit the Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still increasing the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even though 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the waving control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was back in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the runway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was driving together.
He died at the hospital later.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said according to Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're the sonar-knit," he added.
The authorities are afraid that the death rate can reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness reports that there is limited access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is expected to rise, because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights fly emergency assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores are broken."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the day to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year when more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now saying that a man is missing after the flight control in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release Air Niugini, it was not possible to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline informed us that we cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Locals were both involved in rescuing the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were at the hospital until Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is still not clear what caused the ruling and the precise sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go to life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and cried and that he had had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working to renovate a cask nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to bring people to land before the plane fell to about 30 meters in depth.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office concluded its evidence on Saturday in the case of a man charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to combine the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chamber's cell phone at the time he claimed that he was visiting Sanford with his friend Michael.
Sanford sat in the witness hospital on Saturday and told me he was outside that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is a political hippop?
A hipoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hipop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will go back to the beginning and make political hipop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have recently received a revalvation in the United Kingdom because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Baby girl in New York sues couple after shooting with "racist" SMS
A New York child girl sues a couple for discrimination after having received a text message by a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
Parret denied that they were racist, but compared the case to "depression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed his horror that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEY, NOT ENDNU A kind of person," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she fired the Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their ex-boyfriends, who were from African-American, had been bad at their work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is applying for compensation for the fire, as well as compensation for $350 a day in the six months she would have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you cannot allow yourself to do such a thing," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racist, and that Maurice's fire was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been in need of, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
I'm very honest."
Plasco compared the case to "pressuring" and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not particularly helpful," added the investment advisor.
Although the case is still under way, the Court of Justice has already written down the parity on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishing feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to publishing, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small wardrobe, would have been optimistic, even though his story had been rejected, and that the 60-year-old for publishing the books was "bitterborn" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't care about crying," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors lost tried to save her life.
"Nada called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll see you soon.
See you.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart moving slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body was closed down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try and get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperous went on board the plane along with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing Women Try to Stop Suicideers
Two women who have lost contact with suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers, where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to experience the sorrow I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said that his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he really had it wrong.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sorry for it or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas, and when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain, while the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited study of a limited extent – we might have a little agreement," Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would "fall away from the obstacle" in the middle of the fixed party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI carrying out their investigation?
Their detention is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail in their efforts to get the man they want to choose for the country's highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dehumidifiers under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seus referred to data from the South Korea Merger Ministry and said that 1,127 had jumped last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human fog were contributing to the amended figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
In the long run, most of North Korean runners are being offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government has said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border crossing up to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the riots to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced homeowners.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is technically still in war, has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the sides of the nuclear-depleting negotiations.
This takes place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against nuclear-free Korea on an overall plan.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho gave US sanctions due to the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will fall by our own hand," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he's not fit for the college.
The President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed to the Supreme Court, for "histories" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I could not stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called hysterically," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh refused the emotional charges that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesian and a coordinated character" arranged by the left wing that was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the upper court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi's way outside, when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a kingdom if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak truthfully against the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court he is sitting at the moment," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would circumvent certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, prejudiced person has to fight a job that judges and expects us to say 'yes, it's not just nice," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, a series of months and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you think?"
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss who said she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the woman she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just knew.
And I thought it was brilliant."
tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood and misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a weight of men, where I often cry of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a bit afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and acting as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could just as well stand up as a president.
"It wasn't a particularly thoughtful decision," she said grinning to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't take part unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her support, which gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she said that she would not stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I got a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls, "how the press reacted to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what you're going to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How trade wars between the United States and China can be a benefit to Beijing
The openings of the US-China trade war were loud, and even if the battle was far from over, the gap between the countries could be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shield earlier this year by placing customs on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest scale this week with new customs duties affecting goods of a value of $200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has been reimbursed every time, at the latest by charging customs duties of 5-10 % on American goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is probably not giving up immediately.
If it makes Washington withdraw their demands, it means they're giving up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it'll be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a foundation for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas damaged by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place so that refugees can return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily life and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acid has escaped from the country since 2011, where the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to help rebuild the hardy country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophies back, when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points, it demanded to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on a pair of 3 on 16 holes, which led him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of 4 players who have been awarded 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranking European players, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the bag, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get the trust back.
This is an effort, and I am happy to be able to help," said a sentimental Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fax to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 on a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of having hit Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a spy statistics for one of the best golfers ever who have won 14 great titles, only passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a whole weekend problem finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Fury, said after his crew's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys who fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a match.
We lost.
The hat of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to look at the hat.
We were defeated."
