Major members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with Mapteovci
Some members of the congregation are ignored because of the proposal to change their title in the "members of the Great Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the congregation's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
One Labourer member of the congregation said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of Van Wells: On the big twp means blasphemous, and pwp means rash.
A member of the political party assembly, Plaid, said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" about the name change, but he noted that there was a small difference between the MWP and Mapetovac concepts.
In this context, the statement of a great word in is similar to the statement of words in Yorkshire English.
The Congregation Commission, currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name change, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the congregation will, of course, bring the members themselves."
The law of the government of Wales in 2017 gave the congregation authority to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the congregation, the Commission has given priority to the name of members of the Grand Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation reportedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could be put at the forefront of President Elina Jones, from which the draft law on changes is expected to be passed within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes on how the congregation functions, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the Commission's system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and is persistently opposed to its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not acknowledge the vote.
However, referees, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider the change of name to be a simple price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO Pact.
The bells on St. Martin were silent while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to say that once on every corner there were bars and churches," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no one today."
He said the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer quarter-day residents where people go on a regular basis."
As for the church, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help to preserve the rest of the quarters.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in those buildings will be white people," he said, "and that's why they'll speed up closing these churches because it's unlikely that people who move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that blessed the neighborhood took over the building.
St. Martin's Church took over a black community under the leadership of the former John Howard Johnson, who led the men's boycott on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed the training or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 greatly damaged the building, but as the parishioners of the father Johnson made a recovery plan, they ordered orgulas.
St. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the "serious bells".
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin's last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were brought by church leaders and other bishops.
The Bishops ’ Administration – the administrative body of the bishops, composed of church heads, wrote to the Bishops in July express concern that the bishop would "continue to bear the costs" to the Bishops’ Administration, although the Bishops’ Administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency in the bishop's work.
The shark hurt a thirteen-year-old during the hunting in the lobsters in California.
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of hunting in the lobsters, officials reported.
The attack took place seven hours ago at the beach of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday with friends he ran for about half an hour when he heard a boy who was getting help, and then he and the group took him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then "he realized he was shouting, 'She bit me!'
She bit me!'
His entire key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Paediatric Hospital of the Council's where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a media address that the shark was already noticed in that area a few weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper part of the body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains to department cosmetic products in the style of working houses where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant market gap in beauty in Great Britain, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing as sales on fashion markets and household equipment fall, larger cosmetics departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be extended to more shops next year if they succeed.
Investment in cosmetic products comes because supermarkets find ways to use policies that are sometimes used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brand's product palette L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique makeup line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test sales places in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchases and shifts to daily purchases of smaller quantities of food in local stores mean that supermarkets need to put extra effort into attracting people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said stores would increasingly look like a business house in the supermarket's efforts to return the strike to the chains with the big Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos store department in hundreds of its shops, and also imported and Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unprovokedly.
Sainsbury's tested the joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a dispute about the share of the revenues of the pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy came into force three years ago, Sainsbury's sold his 281 apothecary to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products to his assortment in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our assortment brand is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations means that we are now an inalienable destination of the market of beauty that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby retired from a $11 million deal
The Dragons Day star, Peter Jones, is "angrily" after the television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand home and additional equipment Truly.
The company of this money is compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The director of this Morning (37) released his departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has blown up the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones show by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on their new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was "angrily" when a golden girl admitted to television, during a tight meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there was no longer time to devote to their branding home and additional equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double the Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly Truly put himself at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
In Marlow's seat, there's a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost millions because of huge investment in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truey with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined as company director in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of his share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin as the leader of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He complained about the criticism he might get from the media because of a comment that could be characterized as "unpresidency" and because of a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his crazy voice "reader of the news."
"I didn't give up at all."
It turned out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "adequate response" by the US at the original steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the assembly.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We've been on a step since the North Korean War.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kimo led to positive results - the cessation of missile testing, the release of hostages and the return of the afterlife remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave Presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been settled, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international help, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbun.
While the Save the Children's organization is setting up a team to travel to Pala, they're still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pala, to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad to know that this country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters are built in Aceha, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no siren for the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was in force, so it contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help victims of earthquakes is on their way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds hit Mr. Yoko's administration while awaiting new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been disbanded because of street fights by Christian and Muslim groups, who have used swords, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has inserted deep matching match against Chelsea Football Club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge has received a ball from Xherdan Shakiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He put the ball on his left side, then he slammed to the outside stop.
The ball flew high above the penal area turning to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, it fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was in the jump and in the net.
"It was just to position, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturruudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 on a half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker added the ball to Mateu Kovacic in the fifth attack before running from the middle of the field in Liverpool half.
The coward quickly touched and brought the ball back to the center of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, bringing Hazard to the prison.
Hazard was faster than a defense and ended up near the stand by entering the net with his left foot beyond Liverpool's Alison Becker.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims has reached 832
The number of victims of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A large number of people were reported in the ruins of the building that destroyed the magnitude 7,5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and raised the waves high and up to 20 feet, said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with the remains of damaged buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was beaten dead
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in the area of Merseyside.
Forty-four-year-old girl found herself stabbed at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police called people nearby who saw or heard something to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is early, but I'm calling on everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially the cab drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control panels, to contact us as they may have information that is important for the investigation."
The Portaroll police confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and that she was found in the house.
This afternoon's friends who think they know a woman came to the face to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing, and the police have said that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to come in or leave the building.
He was left without a text when he found out what happened.
The residents were now told that they would have to wait hours before they were allowed to go back in.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
One woman came to a crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so horrible."
At 14 o'clock, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next door.
A larger number of police officers were inside the police cordonal, overseeing the residential building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, indicating case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest monument in the middle of a "revision of history" dispute.
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, which were carried out by his Puritan followers in the Taliban.
But Cromwell Society's proposal described Mr. Crick as "crazy" and "try to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "As part of the current discussion on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order, he didn't do an icono-mortem during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his predecessor Thomas from the past century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell's author, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of an opinion from the nineteenth century and a part of historiography that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the nineteenth century rather than today, to be a protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is entirely the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict from the middle of the seventeenth century formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable person representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord's Protector are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The killer's pig caused death to the Chinese farmer.
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig in a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject the pigs of the vaccine into the pig on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth with blood.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighed 550 pounds caused fatal injuries to the farmer, as stated in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin who introduced himself as Wu, conveying Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said to Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners reportedly negotiate a deduction for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
Pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, killing a man's critical injury.
Ten years earlier, the pig had a heavy 650 librarian in love with his tractor while his wife had not been frightened and exhausted.
After the pigs had eaten an oregano farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "slipper".
"They're just playing.
They like to scream, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring scattered rains to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa was weakened by moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to rains across northern Mexico and south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosini's first category hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles an hour from five in the morning to the east time on Sunday, and was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I form in the Pacific and move east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push tropical investment north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture together with the coming lake will create scattered rains in the south-west in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, floods and possible cliffs in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in falls that will be reached in a spatial sense and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical tropical rains.
Flying pedestrians in the desert would be extremely unimaginable at the risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rains in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms, with strong winds and sand storms.
Next I'll bring the local rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
It's possible the total falls from over half an inch, which could cause the noses and ankles of August.
This will be the first wet season rain in the region.
The calmed tropical rain will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The spits will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
In October, large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States may occur as the Arctic is getting colder, and tropicals remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short breaks.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will try again to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from about 80 degrees from the south-east to the north-east.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a large possibility of temperature above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people saw on Thursday an exciting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh before the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with the broadcasters that interrupt regular broadcasts due to the latest complication on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI on a one-week prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate's judicial commission that it was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had touched and tried to disfellowship at the high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that it was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble getting the people who follow the transfer from the office.
To get better, it's a public like the one that's following football eliminaters' matches or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5,69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, said from Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high and after hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanauga, the CNN and CBS network cameras recorded the tapes of the protesters who called on him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He was standing on the fence looking for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live transfer to the CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
It was said to him, "You have power until so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was more to say at the hearing of the commission.
Cables and television networks had a live transmission hours later while the judicial commission voted on whether to continue the appointment of Kavanaugh Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the so-called next week, which calls for a minority of Democrats.
Flake's part has been defeated by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugah charge.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview to her headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that the UK and the EU take customs from each other "very absurd".
The murder of Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, a suspect for the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned indicted for second-degree murder, said by the Baton Rouge police department.
Officials posted a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB channel reports CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, police said he confessed to killing Waydea.
His bailout was $350,000, a lawyer said.
Baton Rouge's eastern death squad issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gun shot in the head and neck.
The department said that the merits belong to the police working group for Louisiana fugitives, the criminal lab of the state police, the Southern University police and the residents of the area who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the club LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agency for the "difficulty and the tendency to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker 6 feet high and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU Club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we keep worrying about," Wade said.
Vulcan throws ash out of Mexico City
The ashes that bloomed the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center followed more earthquakes and torture.
The pictures on social media show a thin layer of ashes covering windshield cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increased volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists in the face of the annual independence referendum
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protestors, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police order, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the marking of the annual polarising Catalan decommissioning referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw them into the dust with their eggs and colors, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, they were beaten and beaten by a police officer who used pendants to suppress the fight.
Independence supporters have been scanning for hours "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness" and clashing with the supporters of the Union who called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in protests, local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region, which was defined as independence a year after the first October referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose, by a large majority, independence, although the outcome was low, because the anti-circumvention opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts across the region.
Groups defending independence camped Friday night to stop demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry happily because they're allowed to vote, but we're in a locker now," he said.
Although they took the key, but a strong victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties who are relying on independence had difficulty holding back the trap because some of their most famous leaders were in the self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a statement on the phone to support the police, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who had been detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Application in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashing into the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after several car crashing into the house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that one moment on the car was shot from a single shot.
Menge's strike brought Livingstone a victory from 1:0 against Rangers.
First goal Dolly Menge secured a win for Livingstone
The advanced Livingston surprised Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerrard at the 18th Ibrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was aligned with Hibernia in a different place.
Gerard's club hasn't noticed any victory in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind which eight points will be left next week.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapids from Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended a series of matches in the league to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't yet experienced defeat since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against a guest with a lack of stamina.
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge a long time before they scored the goal because their direct game was very problematic for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped to receive the ball that Craig Halkett had with his head turned to the goal.
Hosts were asked to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free strikes.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
He was sentenced to a free strike against Rangers, Livingstone made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mangu, who took the ball and hit it from the center of the penal space.
Until then, Rangers dominated the ball, but the defense of the host remained unprovoked and the goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman's feet were stopped by the Gollman Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was shooting too wide from another free strike for Livingstone.
Crosses were constantly arriving in Livingston's prison and were constantly defended, while two criminals who were looking for – one after the error against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game by hand – were not assigned.
"Finemenal game" Livingstone – analysis
BBC journalist Scotland, Alastair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni areni
A phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one, they were excellent, and they continue to surpass expectations on the way out.
Their style of games and players almost haven't changed since their return to the top, but the big credit belongs to Holt that gives energy to the team from its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a well-organized defense, until Menga gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla through the whole match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
From time to time they were good under Gerrard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
There were no final hits – only one time they broke through the host line – and this is the kind of call to wake up for Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of laughter and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany, whose aim is to reform NATO's relations with the Allies.
They differ on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks out of Turkey lives.
Police have imposed security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double demonstrations reflect a division in opinions about a guest some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others are intent on being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bikelist killed in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 after British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened with an ambulance, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the second biker died in a crash in which the driver left the crash site, in the street of the Children Street, which was about a mile away from the crash site.
The London police said they were working on the victim's identification and family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security accidents for men, said from the Prison Office.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin's prison, in Worcestershire, on Sunday at 9:30 a.m., and they still live.
It's called on the special squad of "Tornado" officers to calm down the nerves in which eight guards are involved in one jail wing.
Officials have suffered minor facial injuries and help is given to them on the spot
Portarol Prison Administration said: "We have arranged a specially trained prison staff dealing with an incident that is ongoing in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for that and they could be extended prison sentences."
The Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager was admitted to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special team was called to prison because of serious accidents in which personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's exactly what will happen very likely at the beginning of the next week while the hurricane of Rosa with its remaining energy passes through the desert southwest region, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued warnings on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix claimed that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 had maintained the status of tropical storms or depression in a circle of 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, there will probably be 1 to 2 inches, and possible up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there's no fear of floods, Rosina's rain could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be useful because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to information from the American Dry Control Agency, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona was hit in the least by extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, on his way to Hurricane Rosa, he'll lead to a cliff on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricanes on Sunday mornings with 85 miles per hour winds, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and that's why it's going to begin to feed.
Therefore, Mexico is expected to hit the tropical storm by force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great risk of flooding.
"A total of three to six inches falls are expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico with the strength of tropical storms before coming to Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south Utah late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is major rains in Baja California, North-West Sonori and the American South-West Desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to cause stormy floods of life and floods in the deserts, as well as cliffs in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenagers found injured near the Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning after British weather.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two-eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in Radstock, said Avon and Somerset policemen.
Officials are calling to call those who have any video of the events on the mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered shame and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is against the brutal and unwarranted tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered shame and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the claims of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexual assaults several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to hearing his accusations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the shine, quality and courage" that day.
"The vote for confirmation by Judge Kavanagh is a vote for confirmation of one of the most advanced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," the group of supporters in West Virginia said.
The president was not directly involved in the nominations of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the significance of the Republicans' exit in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates on every side."
Trump claims that democracy is trying to "probate and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the CNN Senate is expected not later than Friday, a senior official of the Republican Party for the CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them collected by huge waves that hit the beaches, when large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday when waves up to six meters (18 feet) hit the coast in the dark, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found.
Cunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their jobs on the beach and they did not run away immediately, and they were wounded," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster recovery agency, said in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, carried cars, balvanes, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometres per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up to the trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in the city of Pala.
Photographs from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
Supporting continued to hit a coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of the long, narrow bay, increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
He described the nugroho damage as a "breath" and said it was destroyed by thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongale, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was highly critical because it did not report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on top of the street who panics at the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
They couldn't confirm the authenticity of the video right away from Reuters.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a lack of electricity that has cut off communications about Palu, making saving efforts by the government difficult.
The army began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased by over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision staff have certainly arrived from Dongala in Pala, where the employees are located in the tents erected in the yard of the office, they have witnessed the scenes of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the territorial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
Until the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their sad story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been tortured for two days by her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an Indonesian paragliding team trainer, trained two missing paragliders in the eyes of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners in Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandagija, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers that hours after the news of Roa Roa's collapse spread to the circles of the paraglider desperately sent messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, according to a police report in Newport, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brinka employee who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, the other man ran behind a Brin's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, standing in a statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper rename in Ye
Reper Kanye West has changed the name in Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the title Ye and has used the title for the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred before his performance at the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons," the author of the show said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So it's me, it's me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without letters and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the revenge against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to obey the Mexican people."
The army shot at peaceful demonstrations in the market on 2 October 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when the left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to educate young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more active in the field of art intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in that field, the investor and artist of the art intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
Comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued releases of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be the first place in the field of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances that a great deal will happen next in the field of art intelligence in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, who published the book "Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order", published by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most famous art intelligence companies, Face+.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an art intelligence system that showed himself superior to the top-ranking American Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the China branch of Google.
Lee confessed to earlier American government technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defence research projects and asked when to plan the next contests on which future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not taking China's academic leaders away, it's corporate," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked great individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer green maps to doctors from the field of artistic intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of the art intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Department formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is trying to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Elections Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundations, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in the research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation which sought to form the Commission's national security for artificial intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum to change the country's name in the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its own territory and has put a veto on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Djorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised the question of whether a minimum of 50 percent would be required for the referendum to be valid.
The voter's question was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Applicants for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries caused by the collapse of Yugoslavia, deserves to pay for entry to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would manage the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there was no report of irregularities by 1 hour in the afternoon.
However, output was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voters went to the elections.
"I have come to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted at the Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way to NATO membership of the Union and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and brought chairs to the front of the tents that were torn apart by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud land.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said membership in the NATO alliance would make more than necessary investments in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the papers.
He said the result of "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
The poll published in the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday says that 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the necessary output.
According to the second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote "for".
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50 percent turnout plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton and achieves goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have rid themselves of Brighton's defense in a 2:0 Manchester City victory against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero scored a goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between the three defense players of Brighton before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green clothes.
He ran around a defense player and was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton naked.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker took advantage of his first hit in the penal area to return the ball to Agueru, who, right-hand sided by the Golman Brighton Matthew Ryan, hit the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some feet problems," the City Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's right.
We're lucky he got naked at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Nescopals an initial advantage in the Prime Minister League.
He scored a goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took a ball deep into Brighton's part of the field.
He added Leroy Saneu on the left.
Sane touched a few times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The invincible attacker threw the ball into the net before he slipped out of the field.

Scherzer wants to play a game without competitive significance against Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the contestant Scherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still on the top.
Rockies at least have a direct pass for a 5:2 win against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out to the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams is likely to be at the highest level compared to everything else this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team on Sunday, but they're supposed to let Scherzer drop in that situation.
Scherzer, who it would be 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and would throw it on Sunday when it usually breaks.

Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation regarding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha, as he spoke of the importance of the Republican's election in half-term.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
These are one of the big, big – although I didn't actually run, I am a candidate because I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of radical democracies, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to return power using all possible ways, see the evil, dirty games.
And do not be afraid of those who are going to harm, and those who are going to run away in order to gain power and control are the ones who are the ones who will have power and control; and We will not give them that which they desire.
The Democrats, he said, are in the mission of resistance and interference.
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling the democrats "angrily, evil, and dishonest."
He appointed a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Diane Feinstein, to encourage the public to make a loud appeal.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, I am waiting for it. Indeed, it was a bad language of the body—the worst language of the body I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local border of the party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in a number of Labour Members of Parliament who were told not to welcome, and all because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and ironically, these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement from a meeting of the Labour Party's border in Nottingham East, held on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I spent as a local laborist member of parliament, the meetings on Friday night were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of "more kind, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that the different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political positions, began to expect me to make 180-degree reverses and take positions that I would never agree with, whether it was a national security or a single market in the European Union.
Always when I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s accompanied by an intruder on social networks, removal calls from the party, convictions from the center’s politics, and they tell me that I shouldn’t be in the laborist party.
And that's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are directed mainly to me by political nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of a colleague who's been carrying a bunch of sexist or racist insults every day, but he doesn't withdraw.
Something that disappointed me most in this political era is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should care about the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a party that accepts different positions and any vote of non-confidentialness or changes in the rules of the party's selection is being suppled.
I've got a lot of advice and for the last two years, they've been telling me to shake my head, be less loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's why I didn't get into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a poet, provoked by the absence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, as a result of which my elementary school students were literally aggrieved, I have been trying to assume that better public services to those most needed, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused with my political positions and areas of conflict with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would order that, when the country falls to Brexit, which will threaten the homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message that I have is not directed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my election unit, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threatening me by removing from the party or political squigglers will not prevent me from acting in the way I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Father on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took the winning due in this exciting game of days in Tennent's Prime Minister of the League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undamaged of ten teams.
In the end, the home team took the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the larger number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"So far we've been tested in games and we're still undamaged, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru every honour, they took advantage of their opportunities better than us."
Grant Naderson's attempt in 14 minutes, who converted Frazier Climo, gave Ayr's advantage, but he's a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, whom Warriors let him play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerous advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unstoppable attempt.
Climo's pendulum increased Ayra's leadership before, just before half-time, he made a solo attempt to hit the result from 17:5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and tried Patrick Anderson, who converted Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruarihid Knott, who was brought out on the carrier, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of trying Stafford McDowall, which transformed Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of a number of powers with an unstoppable attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to the error over the Clim without the ball. MacPherson reached touch down with the penalty line behind the incoming Ayra mill.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's strike in the prison room and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt of the host.
The Still Game Series star prepares for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game series, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the hosting industry after learning that it is appointed as the director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 50-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series that he writes about and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Agrindingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun's daily news revealed that Kiernan wanted to be included in the "recent restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the seabed in La Paz.
In public buildings, the sailor of the ocean is a flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are packed with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the sea lost in favour of Chile in the bloody siege of the natural resources of the 19th century – as well as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice judgment of the first October after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught a stroke, in the spirit of unity and air, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and claims that – after a decade of grueling negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who is facing a controversial fight for a re-election next year, also plays a major role in the issue of the verdict that will be brought on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that it will change a little even if it decides.
The body of the United Nations with its headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was pronounced only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of exit to the sea has been conquered by current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean good will, it ran out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one time, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a point on 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of exit to the sea as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to disarmament until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not stop nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises given during the summit in Singapore between conflicted leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the border to relaunch nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just letting the dreams go that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the US declaration ending the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjongang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, the government is sceptical when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang in terms of the nuclear arsenal that that country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month to prepare a second summit of Kim and Trump.
The latest series of huge hats presented in Paris fashion magazines that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely protect the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of open-ended hats on the tracks of their Spring and Summer 2019 editions, all in Paris's fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers on fashion trails have shown their impressive creations.
Valentine's most successful piece was a six - story hat with a wide pernat area that swallowed the head of the model.
Among the other glamorous additions there were beauties with beautiful stone, magic hats, and even pineapple, but their intention is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also introduced a collection of bizarre masks, and that's just in time for Halloween.
Many of the scarf masks had their lips swelling and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they were in high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment with a trigger and a mask, and the other reminded of the cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after La Bombe, a broken hat with a two-step radius seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation on the runway – a broken beach bag that is almost as big as the model that carried it.
The Zagasitonarangasta bag of rafia with rice and white leather lunch was highlighted in detail Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 on the Paris week of fashion.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, as the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for the above-mentioned fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to the people of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding results in the studies, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, which represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, chosen careers and a place in the society of the world.
As an educational sector that can invent and implement its own teaching plan and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired subject of the snake in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language who understands it gives him a head.
If you speak to him in his language, that gives him a heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's survey, we see that the languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest pass scores in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have learned foreign languages have received an A assessment in the final exam of high school.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students received an A assessment from the Mandarin language in the secondary school, while 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will no doubt be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in programs of independent schools, and elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons for employers' difficulties in filling jobs were just a lack of people who know languages.
So knowing foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs for which foreign language knowledge is needed, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he's going to have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for life.
They will be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGo among over 4,000 British in 2013, 75% did not know to speak another language well enough to conduct the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, you will always find a few languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment language is crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play Sunday in the preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes she's gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, claimed that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during President Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need preseason swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's set in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week, including visiting friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his voice is waiting for a full-fledged seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight in the east time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's collection in West Virginia under the transmission live on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which the charges for sexual harassment were intense, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the primary objective of this series of collections is to help Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that meetings this week are being held to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and extend most of what they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial a part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," Trump's Reuters portfolio campaign that refused to present itself.
In Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's assembly could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday there will be a second time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who's not standing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his rating in polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed fighting to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder buys.
The bet is a fully invented concept in sport, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a gear right now?
"They led six points, and now four, so it can be said that the trap is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points more, with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, between the other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three points out of the possible four.
Speeth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and led by his example.
The highlights of the celebration became increasingly louder during his round, to eventually play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were left behind for two after two.
His final blow with a 15-hole match was followed by a similar shout, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for an American team.
"You just have to give everything up and worry about your sword," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Speetha and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder's main story.
An unusual, but an inflexible European couple got all four games and games without mistakes.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't play the gods hit on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far also the way in which they share energy with the loud audience has been reinforced in the position of main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory while the sun rises above the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best for both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly overpowered by Sergei Garcia, a hero of four ball games that morning when he was playing with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they could not even pull out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The games with four balls and fours are so fascinating to look close to because of the interaction between couples, advice they give and do not give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great advantage before the final day, but this fourth session has shown that the US team also has a desire to fight in which some suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day Ryder bath
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant priority, since after Saturday's matches in the game with four balls and fours won the 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victories over undisputed Tiger Woods, increasing the current score in the Le Golf National Club at four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorna fought to restore the trophy that lost into Hazeltin's golf club two years ago, dominated inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States has provided greater resistance to the fourth tournament, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the balance.
Team Jim Furyk has to win eight points in 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debtor to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Mollwood" after a fantastic weekend, only another couple in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After running Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they made a great team of tired Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, which went through two matches on Saturday, was flashing for moments, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in the row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four ball players, returned to Henry Stenson's tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Europe, however, has not all come up with a plan this pleasant throughout the day south-west of Paris.
The triple winner of the major tournament Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose to win 2:1 against John Rahmo and John Poulter in a four-ball game, to return and win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder buys some team back after the remaining four points in front of individual matches, although Fury's side is defending the title, enough unresolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in another place, it seems that they could not carry out an attack on Sunday.
North Korea advises that "there is no talk" about unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of the sanctions exacerbated its mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the UN annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as the termination of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear polygon and the promise that it will not increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no corresponding US response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no talk about our first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korea's protests against Washington's "posted" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjongang earlier did.
Ri was invited to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump was committed to providing North Korea with a security guarantee.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also responded to calls to facilitate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up "denoclearization above all" and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in force, even in the face of the "declaration of the end of the war"," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is letting the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, about which American leader spoke in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister made three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If we were to negotiate this problem about denuclearization with South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such an unexplained position."
Yet, the tone of Rio's speech was radically different from that of last year, when at the UN General Assembly, he said the shooting of American ground rockets in North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a rocket on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much more should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea implements denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it should be, let it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strictly and without delay to be carried out until complete, final, confirmed denuclearizations come to an end."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea, which has been applied since 2006, in an effort to disable funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Riem outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been in North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that he had made progress, and North Korea condemned him only a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would demount a rocket polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "responsible measures".
He said Kim told him that there were "relevant measures" requiring the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students more sleep in an effort to eradicate the more popular culture of learning "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students of the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has set up a course he considers to be the only one in the United States.
The inspiration to run this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"A girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my graduation year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
This year's course is the first time students are given the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improving their overall situation.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffered during the week from a serious lack of sleep.
The one-off course covers a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on the school for coffee, curtains, snacks and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of the lack of sleep on athletic performances and the importance of the routine before bedtime.
In the second part, participants were told that long - term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not momentarily change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects there is in smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride because of the "swallowed night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the lack of sleep becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and this quality, should be a "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against a higher kilogram, because the result of lack of sleep the brain passes into the starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Cheisler to come up with a course after he attended one of his lectures in Harvard last year.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to rely on his maintenance at the level of the whole campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to carry out a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting up an alarm in time for sleep and awakening, and that they take account of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and may interfere with the Circadian rhythm, thereby leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressive defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent the wrecked Steven Gerrard team to a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February 4:1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt made Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unsuccessful leaders of Ladbrokes Primer League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired Rangers never came close to equality.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingstone climbed to third and behind are Hibernate only because of the head difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was being shot by an object on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that exceeded Ayr and placed himself in the semifinals of Betfred's bath.
On the other hand, Holt identified himself as the same eleven players that took the point of Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but Livingstone made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short of reaching the goal just two minutes after Menga was first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle-field player missed a big chance and was shooting next to the goal.
The deep, free blow of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was just able to sneak next to the goal, the end of the stop.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a pen in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless met, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only made two hits on the goal in the first half, but the former goalman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, without any major problems, defended the blow with the head of Lassane Coulibaly and stole the silence that directed Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's first goal in 34 minutes may not have reflected the real power relationship in the course of the game, no one can deny that he was worthy, if not for anything else, then for the effort he put into it.
The Rangers couldn't choose again with a deep free shot of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and this replacement almost gave the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
However, Livingstone continued to instruct guests to play exactly the way it fits them, with long matches of Lithuania and Halket.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the edge in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well held and defended the attack of Jacobs, and then Lithgov from the corner sent a ball next to the goal.
The replacement player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, was looking for another pen when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, to this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that in time will become a device known as Geiger's numerator.
In addition to being one of the main science protests, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950's "Call of the Crown" film, in which they seemed to be incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these hearing aids, you can hear the effects of the atom in your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans, "Yeah, that's it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach an immunological system to "see" a malicious cell
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches an immunological system to identify malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancers, and then they inject themselves again.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovary of the woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their transfer to the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 and their reinjection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of cancers" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immunological cells from patients and "learning" the same way that the target of malignant cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a loud speech in support of Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was expelled from the study during the Saturday Night Live show after a wave of performances in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he wore a hat with the title "Make America Great", insulting the Democrats and talking again about his support of Trump.
"I've talked so many times to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I cared about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL launched a sketch show in which Matt Damon played and in which Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment.
Although not broadcast, the video of West speech was shared by the comicist Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West by setting up the video.
West also complained to the public that it was hard for him to get behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They chased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
I was bitten!
And then they tell me I'm down," said Washington Examiner according to instructions.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "it's going to turn Superman's fear because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to grumble at least twice, and members of the SNL's show team were clearly affected, Variety said, while one person who was present said, "The entire studio has been completely silent."
The West brought as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The West confused many with the performance of the song and loved it crushed in Perrier's mouth.
Westa supported the TPUSA Conservative Group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not being in front of the villains."
But the director of the show Karen Hunt tweeted that the West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he has embraced and broadened the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name, saying that he now "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague of the reper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course a dead music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then in "an artist previously known as Prince".
Charge for attempted murder after a person was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast
A forty-five-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear in the Court for a violation in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the series "The Games of the Presbyterians", Kit Harington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who is a player in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series of the throne game.
However, an actor (31) turned to the stereotype of a hero sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys are very often considered to be rude in order to be respected.
In a statement on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of a toxic cat culture at the time #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's Games (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I'm personally having a pretty difficult question at the moment -- what did we make a mistake in representing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may in part be responsible for the spread of the toxic cat of culture because of the display of characters represented as men.
He said, “What is born, and what is the matter of resurrection?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets, and why do young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the pre-tations or lessons of the series of the Presbyterian Games at the end of the following summer, saying he "ended with battlefields and horses".
Kit will be acting in the theater piece Sam Shepard True West since November, talking about a film producer and his brother, a robbery.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that what he met his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in a series of games of thrones.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me the future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a love partner of Kit's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's prize.
Couple married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new cases of 14%
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in the previous situation.
In the past, HIV has usually rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of virus-infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from a year to a year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been considered illegal since 1997 in China, but they say that discrimination against LGBT is very widespread.
Studies estimate that due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up in marriage to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff has published information about the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
US MP Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff has published personal data from three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of these legislators.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are posted by experts and the website of "ultra-defence wing".
"Truths, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and an unknown person published it on Capitol Hill during the Senate Commission hearing on sexual harassment instructions against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugha.
The publication of the information came at some point after the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative web locations such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is linked to the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims - is in no way responsible for completing this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked a verdict on the Internet, which was issued by former White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial goes away with anger," Flescher wrote.
"This concludes that she does not have the temper required for a Congressman.
When someone accuses him of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
It can't be a trap.
She can't justify the prosecution's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently opposed Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, who were accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced via Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true," he shouted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the relevant competent authorities and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they correspond to all their procedures that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff members."
Review of Johnny English again in action – a blue spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British theme film, which can also be applied to this follow-up of the French satirical action comedies about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with "Johnny English: born again".
Will the ironic autosaterate about how clearly we are useless be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incapacitated Johnny English rubber face got a new chance to blow something up – with his name giving more than anything that the word about a general comic creation is designed for cinema audiences whose English is not their mother tongue.
It is, of course, about a foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's trumpet, and that guy who played only one note in the context of the "Chariots of Fire" theme melody at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It was also originally founded on a passenger and an international man by a wave of secrets that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest IT capture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English comes to a helicopter dressed in medieval German armor and when the rotor knifes make a brief announcement about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor feels weak and in a very strange way superior, especially now that the "real" film brands like 007 and the Invincible Mission itself add comic elements.
I think it's about children's humor, not adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English aren't inventive and distributed as Atkinson's gays in the style of non-military movies like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a glass of water for a prime minister, a pumpkin and an affected person who already survives a complete fracture due to a political downturn: Emma Thomson masterfully played this guy based on a sample of Theresa May, but the scenario is rather obscure.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the pensioners.
And that's what it's like to be a student in a retired institution, Johnny English, who now works as a teacher, but unofficially holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gays when English holds a spying academy in the "School of Hand."
English quickly goes back to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to recompute it with the former disproportionately patient partner Bough, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine, in whose energetic and loud role Vicki Pepperdine is a little spent.
So Batman and Robin are once again at the service of the Secret Service of Her Majesty and the happiness of a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the criminal Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their stay of comic adventures: crushed in the canoes, they set on fire an elegant French restaurant, a real chaos with a cross boarding on Voltina luxury yacht, and English will start a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of Voltina's house using a virtual reality listener.
It's obvious that a great effort has been made in this last sequence, but no matter how nice and happy the whole movie was, it's like it was made for children.
Pretty middle quality.
Like the other films about Johnny English, I can't ask myself, can the British film industry think of any role for Rvatat Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to make a plan for Britain to work for four days a week, and to be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to transfer the time it saves to workers thanks to the revolutions of artificial intelligence (AI) by assigning them another day.
Employers would enjoy this in a three - day weekend — but would still receive the same pay.
Sources say that this idea would be "assembled" in the party's economic programme and plans to improve the working conditions and rights of workers.
A four-day shift to work week approved the Syndical Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "New policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This won't happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition that fits in the party's approach to economic rebalancing for workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
Portparol Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it".
The opposition officer John McDonnell used a Labour Party conference last week to explain his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined in order to take power from the hands of "unfair directors" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the opposition office also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not recover their total investment because the labs could set up "debts" based on perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in company committees and create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10% of the company's value in the private sector to employees who would appear to kill the annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question as to whether an investigation by the Bureau could have prompted some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a "60-minute" release correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was invincible, determined, without doubt."
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be inconceivable.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and a strong accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was energetically denying it," Graham added, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of the citizens of the world, and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the festival of the citizens of the world, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars that will take place, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big lawn of the Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which was the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of a global project against poverty, an international group dedicated to eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "works" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of a citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Was the idea of awarding people free concert the right way to kill people to take something, or just another vision of so-called "clickivism" – when people believe they did something that would change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens' Initiative has claimed that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by their supporters who have relied on a range of objectives.
They say these actions have forced world leaders to publish promises and political directions that are worth over $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 promises and published the proceeds of their actions, with at least $10 billion already allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are Power is provided, the partnership of investors and developers from the United Kingdom who have promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda will allocate $35 million to stop feeding in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, the donor, the national governments and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historic fuss," said Ambassador Powery's, Tracey Ullman, a live concert visitor to London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Great Britain to improve breast-feeding for mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions would affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, which says, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world will say, "It will be a long and difficult time.
However, like all the big moves for citizens' rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports to the Navy – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, has discovered Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of Internal Affairs, and has passed Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian involvement in Syria – namely, there are legitimate government calls – is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has this possibility, together with our Navy, to ensure that sea corridors remain open or to block them as necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants on the event whose organizer was the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that called itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more involved in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, saying that Russia has only one duty, and that its nature depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of oiled natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to beat Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump, has made Berlin a "lawyer" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and needs to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively a natural project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's severe opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state caused Germany's reaction, which reiterated its definition of the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country mixes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020," state senator Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" to run for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the city council in the city of Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transmits the source The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying that he “is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was summoned for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the electoral bodies voted for Warren did not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to a poll conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed that there is more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
Other sound names from a series of democracies discussed in terms of their potential bids in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Budden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was talking about the PTSP Track Palin in the collective support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence in the family after the incident that occurred on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, can be linked to what is happening to other families suffering the effects of PTSP and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," said the public at the joint support of President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they are returning a little different, return a little harder, they are returning wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the family - assault on a woman, obstructing the reporting of violence in the family and possession of weapons under an opiate act, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 countries, D.C. support the resurgence of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the re-examination of a new U.S. policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing the gang or violence in the family.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District submitted a friendly trial report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who are slowing down this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the Federal Police, has not been discovered.
She said her partner was being abused "and violent members of his gang," but US officials refused her asylum claim on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled the 2014 Immigration Complaints Committee decision which allowed non-documented immigrants to flee from family violence to submit an asylum application.
State Prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement he made on Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report says.
The lawyers further claim in the report that the police that disables the entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force."
State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases related to migrants to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing violence in the family and gang violence in June.
"Assil is only available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear because of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Pala as the number of dead doubled in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, comforting her sick little boy in the center of evacuation in the desolate city of Pala.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
The government is depriving clean water."
The residents are returning to their broken homes, wandering about in vain, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals were devastated by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
Some of the wounded, like the Two Harris, with broken back and shoulder, are located outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being helped out because of continued severe surgeries.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been pushed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in the city because of the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
Seven days after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in U.S. newspapers, thanks to the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed a paid supplement of China's Daily newspaper in Des Moines Register, the most sold in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the US Congress elections to be held on 6 November, which China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections indicates that US officials told the agency Reuters, a new phase in the escalating campaign that Washington is conducting in order to put pressure on China.
And while it is customary for governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in the escalating trade war where each other increases import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former senior state mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda in our free press."
"Despite its propaganda, the government of China uses a valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the kiosk located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's problematic, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm wing of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention what the papers were about.
Republicans turn women away from voting in the eyes of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans defending and standing with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanagh, facing several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their voice.
There is no back in these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University School of Syracuse, in an article for the magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had recently asked for the FBI's investigation would be enough to put an end to angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and public speaker of the progressive group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called for a "new number coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to investigate with Kavanaugha's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," said the newsman Stu Rothenberg, a fearless political analyst.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she filed details of the allegations of alleged sexual assault against the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, analysts were of the opinion that negative reactions could occur if Republicans investigate by appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the big old party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of Republican, earlier this week, broadcasts the NBC News network.
"It is not only the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and how they dealt with it," said the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, who supports the election of the Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with which they easily lean on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who filed the complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez reportedly claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Network inventor World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet that will exceed Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching startups whose goal is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source solid platform, the manufacturer of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the intention of the Inrupt is "world domination."
"We need to do it right away," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it "personal support through data."
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently makes Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of employees of development engineers committed to working on the project and community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last few months of Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
Celebrations in honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by Victorian baptism as a fighter in World War I were made in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won the recognition on September 29, 1918 for an attack on the towns of Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had won the biggest British military recognition.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial plate.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the lift for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the battlefield and the military fire."
Later, he rushed to the fiery line and, with the "most heroism", led the water forward before running without anyone's help to the Polish top and cut three out of the military order.
Colonel Vanna died a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never reach, but also something that causes humility."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed the winery after the parade led by the spirit orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt honored to share in the paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got Pepu Prase
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to prevent you from finally watching the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and was shown live during the night on Channel 5 channel in Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just at the time when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed at the end of the transfer of Pepa Prase.
Many were not impressed that they remained awake all night until early morning hours just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption of transmission to cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is about the government's rule that this content is inappropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, and had to be replaced by a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president Bellator for marketing and communications, on the issue of transmission.
"Pepa Prase," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think that when I talk about reprisal, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to accomplish anything until we get there on Sunday, when they're already on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the break came, they circled the scriptures, and they were all hostile.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've exceeded.
It's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said that only in high school did he realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular manager of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for a few months because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" during his childhood because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has taken advantage of its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope."
The triple world champion said he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprisingly."
Daley married Oscar's recipient last year, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much as you are so young," - the first time he appeared in the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
Couples became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son wears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, in his 40 ’ s after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life -- swimming in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song -- a stream of Heather Small -- which responded to him while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still passing by.
Desert Island Disks is on the 4 BBC Radio program on Sunday at 11:15 in British summer time.
Mickelson from the shape of a club at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to get back the form so this wouldn't be an unveiling switch.
Mikkelson, who plays at the record pool 12th time, Captain Jim Fury sent to the club in Saturday games with four ball games and four games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as was often the case for the United States, a five-fold winner spent the day in cheering and improving the field in the game, hoping that he would correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for the Le Golf National demand field, where long unbalanced terrain regularly punishs stray hits.
And if I'm not scared enough, Mikkelson, on Sunday's ninth game, faces British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their games this week in the team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, hit me in the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Fury said.
"He really believes in himself.
He is a member of the House of Glory and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it went and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will record Nick Fall on Sunday by the number of games Ryder Cup.
That could mark the end of his career on Ryder's purchase where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought a certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than puke games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The first time he appeared in a game played in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but they ended the competition with a weight difference of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," said Bjorn, imagined after seeing the 2018 team that won the result 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and it stays focused.
I've been talking all the time, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's over-way on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow they're on the line of individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
It's a message that you have to convey to the players - give it to yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to do the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Fury will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Surik himself was on both sides of these great revolutions last day, since he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he starts with such a ride, he creates a great pressure on the middle game.
We formed our position in line with that and we've prepared the guys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to run a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover up until the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship waiting again
The new frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be released in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but will not reach for at least another year due to the failure of systems and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, a leading ship in the class of completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted by military speakers.
The ship was to be joined by sailors in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that were commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigate class Bremen.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of air and anti-shipcraft missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be arranged up to two years without returning to the mother's port.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to distribute forces outside its territory, will be obsolete when they start using, says Die Zeit.
The unhappy frigate F125 arrived last year in the newspaper, when German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little knowledge of the reasons why it came back, but the German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would have caused the ship, if it had been arranged in a combat mission, to be unnecessary.
The software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who run the old Bremen frigates.
It also proved to be a significant burden for the ship to reduce its impact and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the cost of a complete project, including training staff, is also becoming problematic.
It is said that it has reached the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy is actually "posting ships that can be arranged."
The officer said that this problem had eventually arisen, because old ships were unmanned, and no replacement ships were available.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Shrimp
A new study carried out on one property in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the locality in search of food.
Results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Fund will follow the usual bats and the species soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
The recording device will be set to key locations around the property to track the mouse activity throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls for mice and what they do.
The map of the sites and the report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the level of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, is hoping to show the results of what are the areas of the most important bats' habitats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The Shislim population in Scotland and the UK has significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by works of construction and development, which have a negative impact on the beds and the loss of homes.
Windshields and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The mice aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, are very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, lay inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good buildings.
But there's so much more unknown about bats, so what we're doing here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses how important it is to check whether the mice are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s bed will kill up to 400 women and young people, which will likely result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The mice are protected animals and the law prohibits the killing, abuse, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Sheikh Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our mice, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species develops."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers prepare a complaint against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape, which he was referred to as "false news," saying people want to "promotion" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has filed charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping one American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $375.000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing its followers, 142 million in a video recording on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after a report on the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports, calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-star gold ball winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get to glory by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of privacy concerns," according to the agency Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "non-material damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was volunteering.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to the extrajudicial arrangement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she's now looking for cancellation of the deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester, when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he moved to the Italian diva Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses its world leader's status in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said to BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the event of Bexit's absence of an agreement could cause job losses.
The Toyotin Auris and Avensis factory from Burnston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear of how cross-border trade would work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks in the procurement chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyote production line operates on the "just in time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can come to an end at the frontier which can lead to a delay and a lack of parts to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so that production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 on the BBC today said.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been extremely successful in the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that the long-term estimated additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and the president of the Union’s union in the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs are in prison, they never return again.
The government spokesman said: "We need to draw up a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House.
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "decided for another week" because the fight against the candidate for the Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh has continued, said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is gonna fire the Deputy Attorney General's deputy or not, thereby endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, but it's been the subject of a speech in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was also talking about ringing to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the Senate's hearing of the Senate's judicial commission, which was witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
The Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week on Friday, which further postponed the Senate's vote in full composition.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News channel Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet established, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, having in mind all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would reject this claim: Sandersova did not hold a brief address for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short sentences was not the result of resistance to "theatrical behavior" TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they are being exaggerated."
Then she said she'd strengthen direct contact between Trump and the reporters.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," said without giving evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
A brief speech will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it as much as you have seen us do it in the last few weeks, and those talks with the president of the United States will change the short talk to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during his official visit.
Individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the assembled journalists, unconcerned and occasionally strange.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on the fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland NHS to express the state's gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before UK withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to meeting the costs of resolved demands for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued in summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that for all of you, this was a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, and more widely, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency after head injury
The defense team State Tigers Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in the Saturday defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Master Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened just before the mid-term.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the wearer and took it to further questioning.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee that Abercrombie ended up operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no details about the type of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total rounds on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds being used to help homeless people according to new conservation plans
This move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Today Theresa May will be published.
This step will be considered by trying to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing care and to focus on those who earn more.
More taxes will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight against open sleep.
The additional fee, which is in addition to the existing fees, including several levels, introduced two years ago on the second property and the purchase for rent, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy people who do not have a home in the UK, which is why they grow, and the first time they buy real estate becomes harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying at the first opportunity of a land they did not use, and asked Ms. May to give up access to the home quota before leaving to stop the British "respect of housing policy."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of any investment.
He also wants to give the council greater authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister to return the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means repairing our poor residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be justified that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as the companies, can buy homes easily as well as the valuable British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and inhuman sleep on the open and still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the Scottish representation manager at a certain time.
The forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeastern, which is currently in the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leader.
This summer he moved to the stadium of light after the last season he returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister of the League.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B team and that was it," Ross said for the BBC Scotland Sports Sound show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would be granted only if I were successful in running a club."
Rosa's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic Club said he didn't feel peace because he came after such great names in such a big club, after refusing to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I manage to return this club to the Prime Minister?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I'll be able to be successful only if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ros is only in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he spent as a chief's assistant in Dambarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' training staff.
He then helped allo recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the tracks of falling down in the lower league to the winner of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real intersection," recalled the takeover of the Allo Club.
"I sincerely believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a decent profit, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
That's so much you have to spend every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just fits me.
I've always wanted to deal with management and now I've been doing it, in my entire adult life, I've never felt more comfortable than now."

The perfect time for the cup is Saturday at 17:30, discovering research
The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
In the pubs and bars group, sales grew from 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants dropped by 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting company, who collected the data, said: "A lasting sunny time and longer than the expected share of England at the World Championship contributed to July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June, when the pubs grew by 2.8%, and the restaurants had an even greater fall.
Traffic down in restaurants from 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved far the best result with greater growth compared to the comparable results of the previous period, rather than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also suffered because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there was an increase in drinking sales by 6.6% for a month, with a three percent drop in food sales."
Paul Newman, from the RSM Entertainment and Hostile Analysis Agency, said: “These results continue the trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
Time opportunities and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to sales on the outside of the home market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the drop in sales of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly ill with already existing price pressures.
Long hot summer it couldn't have come up in a worse time for food-focused hosts, and time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brand growth.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales monitoring service in the bar, pub and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes information on the impact of 47 business groups with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds and represents an accepted industrial measure.
Every fifth child has a secret assignment on social networks that he hides from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret assignment on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers, reveals research
Research involving more than 20,000 students in higher education revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news increased the fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the kids said they had a "main" job showing their parents.
Every fifth child, one of whom is only 11 years old, has a job on social networks that he hides from adults.
The research that included 20,000 students in higher secondary schools revealed a sudden increase in the "false Insta" task, referring to the Instagram photo sharing page.
Those news strengthened the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of people said they have a clean "main" job that shows parents, but they also have private tasks.
One mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who called out to others with the words "strengthen me."
Research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and Conferences of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private assignments.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said: "It upsets the fact that so many teenagers come in an attempt to create an Internet space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including a 200-400-metre win in the 1996 game in Atlanta, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained unmoved after he suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time can show me if I recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and I'm doing practice for agility today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Advertising for a publisher in which mothers share their views on the Internet
The company that manufactures traitors shared their views on the Internet with advertising that breast-feeds with cow muzaras.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent traitor", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that new pumps provide to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between the shade and cows with a song whose text reads: "Yes, I am married but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but that's not yours, these are my breasts."
The following refren: "Fump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, mate myself."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions of the viewer, while many said it was throwing light on the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cow for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to pregnant and give birth to us to make milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The pump for issuing Elvie is discreetly placed in the breast of the breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use the traitor advertising for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Advertising without any meaning."
Others stood in the defense of advertisements, and one woman admitted that her song was "urneic."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I still felt it.
Because of the betrayal, I felt just like a cow.
The ad's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is ridiculous advertising aimed at mothers who deliver milk (usually at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "requirements".
This isn't a commercial that praises or lures the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely insensitive, there is no wire or tube and stands in the breast of the breast for the breast, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they deliver the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s company, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a smooth and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between the breast and the cow of the muzara we wanted to put into focus the delivery of milk and all the challenges that come with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the Seven fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Marte Jakobowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased, although the number of months of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find a guardian for children.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers and themselves were migrants without documents that were afraid of endangering their country's ability to remain by appearing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential elders and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, said last week in front of Congress that this service arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of minors without a follow-up.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had not been convicted.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either caregivers or members of the parent's household are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed criminal acts.
That's why we're gonna keep looking for those people, Mr. Albenz said.
In order to ensure that children are more quickly passed through the procedure, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers say in the reception.
Many will come forward with a video call instead of a personal call to ask the immigration judge to legalize his status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children stay closed, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outbreak of anger or an attempt to escape, the workers of receptions and reports that have come from the system of the last few months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as those in the town of Tornillo, where it is much easier to avoid signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale also called on Syrian refugees to return, although war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Mouale, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that the forces were illegal in the Syrian country, in response to the fight against terrorism and "will be counted accordingly."
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that Syria "war on terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "the holy fight until we exploit all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily responsible for training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country with a broken war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and he blamed "a single Western country" for spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has turned away a major attack by the Syrian forces supporting Russia in a province where three million people live.
Mouale, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military action against the jihadist and the Nusra-related fighters will be launched, which will be "encumbered."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition in order to draw up a draft post-election constitution for Syria and prepare a way to the elections.
Moualem made the terms of the Syrian Government's participation in the committee's work, saying that the work of that body should be restricted to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external engagement.
Why Trump will be selected for second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, for what many liberal observers are likely to hope, the objection and scandal did not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of eyebrows.
Since 2014, the rating in the hit-time was more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN channel and almost doubled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hit period, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the show Rachel Maddow Show of the MSNBC channel exceeded the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer's producer of the "Defended Survival" drama on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime author of comedy and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few of the harsh truths about getting into the Hollywood boys' club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election..
Her driver said he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'cause he's laughing at me,' said Mrs. Scowell.
Haos has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the law on abortion from Roe's anti-Wade procedure, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what will be the state of global tension.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you had been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Stras," about Paul Manafort's jacket, which is worth $15,000 (“part with a bold attitude of rachatism”, wrote Washington Post) and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump giving Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that I feed you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the director of the Zlagaonica show, commenting on the rotation of the acting position and the daily complications of Trump's show (criticizing the American football league, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fless's this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed in and looked at the MSNBC and recorded CNN simultaneously.
He could not be separated from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was prepared to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big cash flow from side to side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same place.
The recent border crossing of the county in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic Representative Connor Lamba, who came to the head of the other county after the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in conflict with the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old circuits were continuously formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th round has launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a massive victory in a wide - eyed special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point preliminary district.
Political analysts gave little priority to democracy.
The United States is considering the punishment of El Salvador because of China's support, but then withdraws.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little support from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the Department, in a statement in the beginning of the month.
However, the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received US$ 140 million in 2017, including for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and the targeted critical restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which should be the continuation of a similar set of last year, which represented a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually interrupted any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration adds to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next to be prepared could be a report by a special investigator by Robert Mueller on the possibility of trump's obstruction of the judiciary, which now has significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr Mueller has also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attack.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is prepared to step back to the electorate, and perhaps before the jury.
It is a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, nor those in Europe that are similar, inevitable to him.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the victims.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the unmistakable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing more of these breaking points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an immediate position since this letter last year reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president and suggested that he is not similar to the performance of the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or honest, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I was an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that cuckoo table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday to host Rapid from Vienna, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after a impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrell at the beginning of this month, to put themselves in a good position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee wound prevented the associate player Graham Dorrans from debiting this season until the unresolved match with the 2-2 final score, but he is convinced that Rangers can use that result as a jumping board for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with a point.
We may have been able to take them, but all in all, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we turned to the second, and we were better.
On Thursday, we are again expecting a great European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, although, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was no doubt difficult, starting from everything that happened to my injuries, until the change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we're training well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of worry about pension savings
Despite the fact that the students had a clear idea of how they would want to care for them, few of them talked about it to members of their families.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide investigation said they talked to their partners about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said she talked to her children about it.
"People want one of the family to be old about them, but they don't want to start a conversation on this," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the sector for life insurance in the Nationwide company.
Here's where it starts.
Speak to your spouse and to your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not put your wishes ahead of your own.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be an important factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out how to pay these costs.
Your long-term funding choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Manage your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Make authorization to make a medical assistance decision so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the conclusion of a full-power financial agreement.
This implies choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs emergency medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are?" asked Martin.

A man shot with more hits from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with several shots from an air rifle while walking back home from the night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, his stomach and his hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 according to British summer time, as a "symbolic act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials reported, and the number of deaths is expected.
As the relationship ended, relief officers could not obtain any information from the province of Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of a 7.5 degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesia, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached an area extending over 300 km (180 km) to the north of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administratively lower rank than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the nature of the province of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel miners are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongal have been hit by tsunami several times over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Cunami also hit the west of Dongal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the West Coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 degrees struck the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, starting the tsunamis that engulfed the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pike earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Acehu, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the deadly destruction of earthquakes and tsunamis from 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he committed violence in the family, prevented the reporting of violence in the family and supported arrest, a report published by the Alaska State Police Agency on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit, and he had a 500-dollar parole deposit, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he explained that "surely not guilty," the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palina's criminal records have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the reporting of domestic violence and of possession of weapons in an alcoholized state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Saru Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after bringing his son's violent behaviour to the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
There have been interruptions in the connection and supply of electricity, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesia, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, video clips show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala when the tsunami flooded the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfull Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died -- a rare sentence that has not been committed for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used the rented truck Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, picking up the pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 's intentionally killed eight victims and 'intended' caused serious bodily injury, a request for the execution of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York, is made.
According to both of these points, it is possible to commit a death penalty, as stated in the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Supreme Court charged Saipova with 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of murder and recruitment, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "suffering, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernana Ferruchy, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca", the application for a sentence is made.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the New York South District last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a New York federal case was executed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being sentenced to conspiracy to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the video of the ISIS on his phone he was inspired to execute the attack, it was reported in the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said they were clearly disappointed in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of being released for the admission of guilt, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to express the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a protest at the conservative conference.
Former EU Independence Party leader said politicians had to "sympathise with the dissatisfaction" of Eurosceptics, since one of the Theresa Mays suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" until now that Mr. Farage was secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in trying to unite her deep-separate ranks stressed the conservatives who advocate the EU's stay and joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and attacks by the supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they continue their efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and "haosa".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting Go to go to Solihul that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
An envoy from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out to the streets and chose us.
"Please discard the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Ms. May added: "The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said to the gathered that politicians must make themselves "satisfaction" if they are to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people and our political elites," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to order them "that won't happen to you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the survivors marched through Birmingham before they held a two-part assembly in the city center.
A number of activists have been taking advantage of the transparency of "Torians against Brexit" following the formation of a group this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis insulted the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren's planning to seriously consider the presidential candidacy.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider the presidential candidacy" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Homeland spoke about its future during a participatory meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the honorary critic of President Donald Trump, again applied for elections in November against a Republican representative at Geoff Diehl's House of Representatives, who was co-chairing Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can face the Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors on which the participatory format of the meeting was used since Trump took office.
One of the audience asked if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren turned down the time when women were going to Washington to fix our corrupt government, which includes a woman on the forehead."
Arrest after the LSU was shot by Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday the arrest of a shooting suspect in which a basketball player LSU Wade Sims was killed on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at the press conference.
A video of the shooting was released on Friday, seeking help in finding a man who can be seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus Southern University early Friday.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team's order will play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went to the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action point from the point which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior at the risk of lagging behind a double move in the defense of the third round.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of bars and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race, relying on his tires to reach the swift end and ran through the Kimmy Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Valteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was the real gentleman that let me pass.
Team did a really great job to accomplish one-two formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed Senator Diane Feinsten at a meeting Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford in a letter in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly witness Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, wicked and false.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and proud and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information that went public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave information to the public?
You remember her answer. Did you leave the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the public go."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details about Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - yet Feinsten demented that the information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leave her story to the public."
She asked me to keep it in secret, and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who said on Saturday night at the meeting: To tell you, it was really a bad speech by the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense against the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the democrats use them for their own purposes.
They're determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the shame, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who they have to run over to reach power and control," the media conveys the words of the president.

He stayed to secure the Batika Air Flight 6321, which was then standing on the runway.
When he realized that the control tower was falling apart, he jumped out of it.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Portaroll Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our hearts are broken because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state disaster mitigation agency indicates that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as the number of bodies is still below the level of destruction, and many are unable to reach it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesperson said.
The waves that reached height and up to six meters devastated Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.

A drop in a plane in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after a plane crash in the lagoon, one face is taken as missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in a pacific lagoon in Micronesia reports that one face is being treated as missing, after earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the ton aircraft.
Air Niugini in a statement states that Saturday afternoon they are not able to follow the passenger.
The airline indicates that in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and researchers, they are working on finding this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact outcome.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some fathers think the plane flew through the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to break through to the exit for a case of danger through the water that cut them to the point of the plane that was towing.
He said the crew was panicked and yelled, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners working nearby at the port repair site also helped rescue the boat to sail by passengers to the shore before the plane sinking at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of the aircraft registered in the PNG in the past two decades, 111 people were lost, but none of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in a repeated proceedings against a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he used cell phone data to draw a picture of the movement of accused Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and of the victims of Jessica Chambers, aged 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, conveys The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was, according to his own claims, with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testifying on Saturday said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had a certain time after Chambers' death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense on Sunday should begin with the final words.
The judge said he expects the trial before the jury to follow later in the day.

Another black person?
New York's nanny sues a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on the basis of discrimination after she has received a text message from her mother in which she complains that she is another black person."
Couples deny they're racists, judging the lawsuit as an exaggeration."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed discontent with her arrival on the first working day of 2016. She realized that she was a new mother of children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
There's not one more black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, Ms. Maurice sent her twice.
When she became aware of her guess, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their ex-wife, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and that instead of expecting her a Filipino, she carried out a New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a reward for one day's work and the Uber sent home.
Maurice now sues a couple for a ransom, as well as a $350 fee per day for six months, on how much she was originally hired to live with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding that it's discrimination."
The couple were afraid that after being insulted, they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco for Post's husband.
But would you trust your children to trust someone you hurt, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Depriving the prosecution as an exaggeration," Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of the public was quick to judge couples on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not speak to the bears who spoke, a new letter was revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put someone in the position who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little drunk bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, but was positive if his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was these men, he didn't like to be praised," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't your favor.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in a way like that.
Though he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter died, and we had to forgive ourselves over the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were in vain fighting to save her life.
On a regular call he said it was bad, and they didn't expect him to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before, and everything went out.
I could just sit down and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, who had not even dreamed of the pain she was experiencing.
No one knew," she said.
I've got my head down, and my tears are running down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who were loved committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the big bridge are setting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide when he was 18 years old.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would hurt every room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it will leave any consequences."
Mrs. Davis invented those cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, so even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk to me."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say that he was indisposed, depressed, or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his disposition.
He was on the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not see them in his eyes or in any other way."
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but that they have to overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's gonna blow us up.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- a limited length and scope investigation -- maybe that would bring us a little together," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would break down because of the restless side views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their ill will is caused by the choice of the moment.
The elections for Congress are held for all five weeks, on 6 November, and if Republicans pass badly, as expected, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush phoned the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him also his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI makes his report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the Ministry of the Unity of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug stated that last year 1127 escaped as compared to 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors were stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
A large majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a solidly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have been markedly repaired in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped negotiations on denuclearisation.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which broad consensus was reached that he would work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the ongoing lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not a matter of disarming ourselves first on the one hand," the RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugha hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said that because of his temper he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't think of a woman if she had ever been so hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and grinning when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the democratics in the committee, assessing the allegations against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" that organised liberals to anger what Hilary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court since it showed his keenness to the harm of the democrats.
I believe that he has been disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he has turned against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has withdrawn.
I'll say next - if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like being in the Supreme Court, he's not even in the court he's on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District Columbia District Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about any Kavanuchi judgments against the Act on Access to Health Protection or in Roe's case against Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether to alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not time for a hysterical, cautious person to be put in court and we're expected to say if that's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A legitimate anger, anger, which has been heaped upon months and years, and it cannot be resolved without payment.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot, a woman who was an executive director somewhere, and she said she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that made her feel angry and started to cry, and the person she was talking to said that you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are allowed to cast out anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of earlier work, in the office where most men were, is how I was when I once wept for the indescribable anger, an older woman - the cold boss I was always a little scared - grabbed at the door and pulled out on the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When in 1987 Hart was caught in an out-of-the-board business on a Monica Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the president himself.
That wasn't exactly a well-thought decision," she told me through a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snowman and seven ducks."
Since the campaign was already delayed, she was left behind with the fund-raising, so she swore she wouldn't go into the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men would give her all 250 dollars.
Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration for the system that made it difficult for her to collect funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger for the showinism - from which she got into her throat.
You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put me on the monument?
"She cried?"
How trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is over, the gap between the countries can long-term be of benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, was first warned at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest hit occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion ($150 billion), which practically recovers half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of tariffs from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has sworn that the United States will respond to the same measure, and the other by the size of the world economy seems not to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to satisfy the demands, but public worship to the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, Chinese President.
However, experts claim that, if Beijing plays its next move well, U.S. pressure in the trade war can sustain China in a long-term positive way by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a severe fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the refugee return, foreign minister says.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugee and appeals for help in restoring the country damaged by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale said conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mowalem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had helped the rebellion.
Europe took the victory to Ryder's purchase in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 with the US final score 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National van Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored the crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team won 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during the entire tournament, threw a ball into the water at the 16th hole in a pair of three, leaving the French Molinary sword.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds, and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament started in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 points in careers.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't hold back.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be of help," emotional Garcia said after European victory.
He's handing over to his countryman John Rama, who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record on Ryder's purchase.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 top titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to find their way to the hole all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. captain Jim Fury said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we gave resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder baths, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're uplifted."
