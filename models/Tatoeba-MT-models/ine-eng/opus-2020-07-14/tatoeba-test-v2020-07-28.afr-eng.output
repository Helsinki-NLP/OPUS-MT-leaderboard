He's a wolf.
Saturday my father was open.
What he said made us angry.
Not only does he speak French, he also speaks Spanish.
I don’t think anyone has noticed what you have done.
That's a nice couple of legs.
One, three, and five are uneven numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, ag, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It is just not worth the effort.
We got a little late.
Nobody cares.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It will be our secret.
This portfolio is white.

Drink!
Do not miss the occasion.
It's a little cold.
He's better than me.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to view humans as unique among other living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You're working too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.

She married him.
If I were you, I would start right away.
She has blonde hair.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot about him clean.
The horse is in the woods.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You had to attend the meeting.
You can read my letter and correct the errors if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Very few houses were washed away by the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick man swallow a thousand papyrus birds, her desire shall be true.
Tom had forgotten about them.
Don't be late for the train.
If you find something you're good with and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom is not going to help us tomorrow.
I was sorry to hear about her.

She loved him.
Tom did not go.
Do you have a phone?
Do you know the boy who's crying?
Tom will help you.
You don't need a shell.
Birds sing.
If the idiots compete, you'd be second, because you're too tired to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Quick!
They are in the library.
Tom did not do better.
She's very pretty.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we'll end up.
Tom got up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We are not going to eat everything.
But you know well that these would have negative effects.
He will never believe me again.
Tom sneezed his judge’s eyebrows.
The two towns were separated by a river.
We decided not to fire them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know any of them?
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I am not going to be charged with doing so.
All we can think of is real, but what really is is real is the real question.

Can you write an English letter?
My name is Tom.
This is a reminder from Hokkaido.

Don't throw the dog with a stone.
This man screams at me!
From now on, be more careful.
Please go faster.
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will for the first time choose a woman as president, and there will be joy over the long expected occasion.
Thank you very much! You just ruined my life!
We will connect to you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I've never met.
My father's name is Fritz.
Are you speaking French?
I'm in a show.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak well enough French!
I can't come visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a damp, rough summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'm also unemployed.
Can I win later?
Tom was very patient.
I have to go.
Tom will not care.
Sami fixed it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I pull my socks in a japt.
Tom kept trying.
Tom won't mind.
My horse is black.
If it's wrong, she's a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to mail this package to Canada.
Why does Tom have to do this?
Don't you add sugar?
I'm not scared easily.
She's doing her homework now.
What helmet will you wear to school today?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The walls were a light brown paint.
You're afraid of him.
Tom won't see me.
Maybe I shouldn’t be so suspicious.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He's a man of faith.
Tom will not die.
I don't want to see you.
He Prejudices Jazz
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
May I take a look at your card?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I can see nothing.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out differently.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I’m sure I’m not going to be of much help.

Tom won't wait here for so long.
He is my brother.
All human beings are free, born with equal dignity and rights, having reason and conscience, and should act in the spirit of brotherhood toward one another.
They are concerned about her.
The television costs more than the sunglasses.

What is he doing here?
I'm doing my homework.
Is it hot?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where's your luggage?
Who called these bodies to dance?
Can you turn off the lights?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She kept working.
He's young.
Tom was busy at the time.
Who built this ugly house?
He cannot speak many English.
I was just wondering if you could still find a place to stay.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom is not leaving.
Martha is an excellent pianist.
Let's stick to the point.
The news spread rapidly.
Do you have a lighthouse?
Chinese food made the greatest impression in China.
Please hurry!
The dog jumped over the fence, into the garden.
Can I take a day off?
The warm bath relaxed my muscles.
Read this book.
Does he write letters in English?
We have a big garden.
Don’t waste your money by buying things you don’t need.
Good luck!
Tom told me to do it.
She has a house by the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
It's the last straw.
We know each other pretty well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
Not only does he speak French, he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'll be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that? It's totally wrong.
Your name is the first on the list.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun down, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
He's running.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that cat?
He was a good king.
They said that they had always done so.
We're looking for each other.
I'm just looking.
Unfortunately, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn’t be surprised.
This rain.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were still very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom's moving.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like to travel by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.
Sami stays with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does that make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
His music is known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice to make no matter what you say.
Daai is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom is not going to show up at all.
I had to introduce myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he did not kiss Mary.
That smart smile.
I can't get out of this cell.
I don't have time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.
I'm a friend of Robert's.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.
Tom wants time with my sponsor.
I will be very careful.
Yesterday this time was at the cinema.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let us wait until he arrives.

That's what you get!
Is Tom going to die?
A dog ran behind the cat.
I also worked for Tom.
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.
Tom was taken to prison.
It's not a joke.
You promised you would come.
I would be mad to expect such a thing.
Santa Claus lives in the North Pole.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
I got cold.
Let's take off the TV.
Unfortunately, I would not be very good company.
You will not be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
I'd pull you out, though.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like prices.
He doesn't always come home on Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I'm not sleeping anywhere tonight.
I want to leave empty.
The song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn that?
You're stupid.
I completely forgot about them.
She chose to succumb to pressure from her parents.
I need to help my mother.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog, are you a cat?
If you were in my place, what would you have done?
I will be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of work.
I told Tom I'd be now.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami has to wait a minute.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice.
Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm back now with the upgrades.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks out on the lake.
Tom's hands were cold.
Yes, she is eager to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a phone?
Mr. Mitchell demanded that I pay the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than him.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn’t be so sure.
I dream about her all the time.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There's probably an easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We need to start doing this.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her.
Tom said it was unfair.
I don't want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you wake up, he will be studying.
I have a sad skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fight lasted a week.
When was the last time you laughed?
Tom is not going to give a talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom is reading a book at the window.
We're not going to be here at 2:30.
I like eating meat.
I could, however, do it at 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the battlehouse.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so bad.
I eat rice.
I'm sorry, can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
This rain.
Tom will be late.
I'm warning you to take a look at that.
I only bought a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The game begins tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom's gone.
Was Tom there?
My father had recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help by Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
It does not matter what he says, do not trust him.
You had to visit Kyoto.
I got up when it was dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to think about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we were married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
When the wind was strong, and wind and wet, and the cold could come in the thickest clothes, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men entered into the sea.
All cats grow at night.
Stiller!
It's my house now.
A bird fly.
He showed up for 30 minutes.
He goes to a Japanese English dictionary on the reader.
What a man soweth, that he may reap.
I wish you had said it before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I've got a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his board.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot about her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be that easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
That's really good!
The river that flows through Paris is called the Seines.
I'm glad you finally came back.
