This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs have hair, one vast theory, but also provides special elements that are not naturally given by fossil fuels, such as color and three dimensions.
Scientists say that this animal’s hair is made of chocolate in the upper part of the lower part of the body.
The study also focused on the evolution of poultry.

This new environment has different sources and different competitions, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competition than they need before.
The original - language words used here do not change; they still need to be adjusted as before.
From time to time, as the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they began to look less and less like other people.

In the savanna, it is very difficult to find a primate with such a system of planting as humans to meet the needs of amino acid from the plant’s available source.
Moreover, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, uneven eating, and end of death.
The most readily available plant source is the protein found in olives and vegetables, but it's hard to be exposed by primates like us unless it's cooked.
On the other hand, the food of the animal is not only easy to digest, but it provides a high quantity of protein containing all the important amino acids.
All matters are taken into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors overcome their protein problem in the same way as we did in the savannah today.
