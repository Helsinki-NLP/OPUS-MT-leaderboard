Inflation, in Europe, has come to light on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was more important than the forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicating the European Community's statistics office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the direct interest rate by saying that the decline in interest, with the rise in the prices of raw materials and the decline in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "Inflation must be discouraged" in order not to have any further action on this issue.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it is up from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market rates for cereals increased by 88 per cent and soybean has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global price of oil increased by 52 per cent and, last month, a silver barrel cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1, this year, to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent in the next 3 to 4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the managerial rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of participants in Fidesz (The Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly from the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it has now had the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Institut de Investigation) has never previously found such low socialist support, 13 percent.
For faithful electors, the difference would represent, due to the highest determination of the opposition electors, more than two thirds (71 per cent) of support against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrat Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent throughout the population.
Of the faithful electors some to vote, the number of participants from the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the lowest, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high, it rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent additional, the situation was quite serious.
After the more optimistic perspectives of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is planning aggravation and only one tenth is expected to improve the situation.
In December, 71 per cent of the surveyed, i.e. a majority never seen during the previous Gallup polls, felt that the prime minister was doing his job rather than good.
13 percent of the polls trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be treated without change in government.
With 35 per cent of the polls last October, the government and the Prime Minister wanted to remain in office, at present this rate was only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believed that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additionally said that they would probably vote.
In order to compare, for a "legislative election to organize the next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent more likely would participate. Following current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would have no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to registration rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay costs.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation costs and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly 20 percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs commercial triangle have maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, as opposed to the fact that this year's VAT rate has not increased.
Article of Napi Rajasag (Dayly Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a significantly higher value than a thousand forts in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown" in the major food shops in December, have no longer increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forts last year now cost more than ten thousand forts.
The daily Index in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 forums, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forums.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 holes.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forts.)
The prices of the Unicum and the living fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of the grain, nuts and peacocks increased greatly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from a kilo to 139 holes only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forts, so it only cost 257 forts the bottle included in it.
It does not prevent that this year, at the end of the daily basket, Auchan was the cheapest and the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its daily basket by 15 per cent, while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket in the last year and the least expensive basket in this year, we find a 12 per cent difference, while the difference between the least expensive one in the last year and the most expensive one in this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by 1,480 on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 on average, while the impact of the increase in VAT rates was already seen in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process has made trade more complicated, and the hypermarkets could not clearly determine the extent to which products could be applied so far as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the price of the daily basket has evolved so far that the cheapest basket was more than 1 720 forts than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest panels was only 844 forts.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was more than 1,630 forges in the last year and prices of the least expensive also increased by 1,284 forges.
By approaching the two Christmas season, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some first-needed food, the statistical institute found an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Cart, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indications, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers are no longer looking at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long preservation by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important quays were formed in the three hypermarket boxes, as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to polling companies that they do not even reach the expected number of businesses, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospital health conditions, insufficient number of beds, overcrowding of medical staff do not help to block infections, the doctor at the head of the National Centre for Epidemiology says.
Many hospitals also make the economy of disinfectants
There has been no long-term diagnosis of MRSA infection at the János hospital trauma service.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but not long after it had to return because of a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation due to the bacteria in their body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Epidemiology Centre.
This is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise said by staphylococcus gold resistant to methyl oxylline-oxylline.
A third of the people are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angina, amygdalitis, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a well resistant bacteria that will quickly spread under poor hospital conditions.
In the case of temporary or prolonged immunosuppression, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, on the elderly, small weights or with a weakened body.
According to hospital manager János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital life.
In particular, there is no need to confuse infection with the epidemic, no MRSA is found only or not, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the caring staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
In particular, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Taking the sample is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological extraction is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be known that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases see only if MRSA infection is detectable on the disease, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the management of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, otherwise microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance but hospitals do not always take into account.
The realization of microbiological extracts is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, wear gloves and protective masks. However, important deficiencies are detected in hospitals in this area too.
However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in the end of the epidemic, the sick should be removed from each other at a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrable or the proliferation of pathogen agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant costs for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the impact of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not at work.
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd roundabout was raised.
It may be ruled out that the Commissioner of the 22nd roundabout, a resignation from his post, who has broken a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to his death on Friday or Tuesday, Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the Public Ministry of Capital after the related findings were established.
The findings confirmed the first outcome of the investigation that had already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before taking the flight.
On Tuesday last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd district commissioner broke down a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd district of Kossuth Lajos Street. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing the passage for pedestrians.
(In addition, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute an attenuating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turning must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police, he was greatly disturbed by the accident.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Investigative Park in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the financing of the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties.
The €150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million-euro contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily in the context of the research and development project to be carried out at Debrecen University.
During the negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would renegotiate the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of €8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a maturity of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little quoted by the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market that is always the least expensive but will quickly become cheap?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most ambitious target of Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the good market sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the sea side, Albéna, the "Sables of gold", the "Cote du sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, soon or later, the central region of the country, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also raise the interest of investors and they are also growing to be bought in the very expensive corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office surfaces promise the highest rate of abortion.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe and thus a priority destination, after summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, there are traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who count on it buy renovated buildings, at a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old houses, at a price of between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria is listed among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase to achieve a higher value in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital's buildings increases continuously as a result of an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but these last five years have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is mainly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, professional meetings are ending on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the Ministers' negotiations on the post-2012 climate regime will continue.
Political experts and men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions were held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss accurate figures, but were ready to sign a reduction agreement by 2020 of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to the countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit) has been communicated.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 at the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time had made an 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period from 1985 to 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalling the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be delayed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system that was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel Peace Prize, which is responsible for climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees of cell could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are charging video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, with the help of mini-camera mounted on the helmet, are controlled in the general area of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots to the Internet.
The political message is irreversible
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The Department of British Defence has registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and reports videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on to the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to inform the public of the actual objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing compared to the usual TV recruitment advertisements, which was communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant. On the other hand, it also inevitably brings a political message, since it is in a special form justifying the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is embittered because, apart from the videos composed and censored carefully, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses, but they never present the bloody side of the battle.
In addition, many videos were already online presenting the operational areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army is only about to load these videos.
American recruits make it a little different by using America's Army free downloadable rifle game. In this game, the player can put himself directly in the position of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Noel tombola and benigns in the departments
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a meeting at the end of the year with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking a few drinks and coffee.
Another department will organize a live music party, another will charm the officials with a tombola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Feast, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so the power was fun.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas festival will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but these are not the employees of the department who will be invited.
In Noël, Orphelins, the children of the defeated soldiers will receive gifts, for the Missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million forts to create the final year environment.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forts and, on the six hundred large employees, three hundred fifty are expected.
At this festival, the Christmas atmosphere will be tough, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forts and was organized in the National Justice Council (ILO) building on Wednesday with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forts, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas festival, which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company manager of tenders.
The building of the Theatre of the Gahité has been rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to contact the responsible person.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas festival, organized a ball at the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The festival began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening party was not absolutely mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a party on the subject.
The Department of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forts.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and twenty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat snacks, the press service has announced, the festival will not cost as well as 350,000 forts.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his colleagues to take a glass in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room to which 436 employees are expected.
It spends 2,500 forts per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned holiday environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the festival that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20th to celebrate the new year, the Christmas festival will not take place.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 fort per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not party at all for Christmas, they have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The Ministry of the Environment's Press Service did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the grave mega gather together
The League trade unions and the National Association of Workers Councils will be their strike commission on Friday to coordinate the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Box Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant noises in the traffic, as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and BKV employees (community transport) will also strike up to 1 p.m.
The League Trade Unions will learn on Friday afternoon the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the date of the vote in Parliament on the Health Box Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is voted, the strike commissions will meet and decide as soon as possible.
According to the order of Monday of the National Assembly, the vote on the Health Cases Act is likely to take place late at night or at night.
Due to the planned strike for Monday, major noises are planned in the traffic: railways will stop the work for an indefinite period and during the morning a part of the joint transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies will be at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of them is kept updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report making a strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railway Paths) and the Free Trade Union (VDSZSSZ) have failed to find an agreement on the minimum services, gold, in the approach of Christmas parties, are increasingly those who take the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's joint transport will strike the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest's airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the industrial electricity and thermal energy unions of the League will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union have called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours at 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike throughout the country in turn, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires the Government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee, in respect of retirement before the legal age, which would enable the system to pass on the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union (VDSZSZZ), linked to the League's Trade Unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországert Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increase, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the society notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Tzigan population and non-Tzigan population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of the radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is exacerbated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the influence of the increased attention of Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly with regard to the country's confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
They recall that as a result of increased publicity given to the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
"The common treaty of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (accidents, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, to exceed, by mentioning the inability of the police, the army, otherwise said of the state," they added.
They reported that everything was in line with the method that, based on the support of the political society and the parties, sought to reject different political ambitions in a civil context.
The emphasis on the civil character and status of the association therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor that also increases the risk of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some border countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that erupted in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian Guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to be a guard saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Tzigans have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, one can read in the warning of the risk of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital Research, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis was published every year, and if events occurred that could have an impact on risk change, they informed the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked red everywhere
In Hungary, the law sets out exactly the holidays and, around the festivals, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decrease next year.
The parties are no longer uniform in the EU and in the United States.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter so that the vigilantes can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have eleven red-marked parties.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is the 23rd October, which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the festival of work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and of our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious festivals rarely fell on a weekend, according to the calendar, it became common to reorganize working days in cases or only one working day before or after the red celebration.
It is true that we pay the price of the extended weekend by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been established in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the preceding or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
However, it is not worth it to service companies, to the institutions that turn without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will only be changed around the end of the year: from 24 December, life stops almost throughout the country because, according to the experience, most people make extra hours or take vacations they have saved for these purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at their home.
The following year many festivals fall in the middle of or at the end of the week, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow the employees to stay at their home for four days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October will be a working day for Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be announced under the sign of the festivals because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six stupid things that can terribly fool colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that get us almost more: these are things that "beautiful" every day of a place of work.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or we are faced with the challenge and we are consciously avoiding the ambiguity, causing problems to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you you were called the marketing service," said a colleague.
Did you miss a date?
Best of all, he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (that is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is arranged with excuses.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant times to your colleagues and try to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more exciting than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember watching her, you put the graffiti on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your style that you thought you lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking if they have reason to be angry with you for taking their property.
It doesn't bring any envelopes, it's mail in your pocket because it can be embarrassing that it doesn't have any more and that you need it immediately.
You're a colleague's private life dad?
There's no good way to stop the power that's spreading.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (subpositions) about your colleagues' private life!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
bury in you the information shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence, even if your colleagues are also present.
Are you saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick under the pretext of a headache because you feel bad or you feel you need some rest that day, you think that your work, your urgent affairs, your final missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues from getting away from your absence the next day.
Frequent, charging, telephone
You're stuck in your work, but you're brutally attracted to your colleagues?
You have become, without wishing, a witness to a phone conversation that you'd have done better not to listen to?
Don't disturb your colleagues with colds, blackmails, high-voice discussions (which you run above their heads), feet beatings, big words or high-voice discontents.
They may be disturbed even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (editing, design, organization).
You blame the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't blame anyone for that!
Don't take this into account any chaos in the office or in your noisy colleagues!
If you've made a mistake and if this has presented any inconveniences to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix your neglect!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Don't make jogging comfortable even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if it works by putting on beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to respond to expectations, you're no longer interested.
We move slowly in the usual mouth of the morning.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tone all the time, then a female choral comes along as a real jewel.
Mr.2 broadcasts the song Wings of Zagar Love.
The Hungarian musical life has long been no match for us with a good-quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems that the noise becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi's appearance, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground begin to slightly change the overall image and, despite the new mode of garage rock that decouples the guitar, the Hungarian electrotropic proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz ally, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become familiar when he was entrusted with the composition of the recorded soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
Early training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the van2 magazine quoted their first album in 2002 among the 50 most important Hungarian-market discs and announced Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only Hungarian-oriented creators who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ass have become unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group responded as needed, a new and better disc came out.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line of the old group of Balázs Zsager Pecs.
We are good with the reference to the flight, but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of the rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, spreading from little to little of the popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
Is everything okay, then?
hvg.hu asked questions in Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: is your music well remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
Music itself saying alternative, underground can also be mediocre and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
Well, a good pop song can be honest as well.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
People go to concerts, not only young people in their teens or 20s, but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, I'm glad to see that people are coming more and more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not designed to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the inevitable changes at the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to respond to the public's expectations, you wouldn't be more interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's working alone and he's made a career west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let us deploy it.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palm of Mr.2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupy the first place.
Many are those who heard the name Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style have you deliberately opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to absorb the sound orgy and the most difficult themes discussed on the whole disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guidelines?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a chorus of the gospel class.
We had the idea to compose this chorus of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the choral was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece was already in an instrument version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something else missing from this song.
The follow-up to the agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the song the night the girls took later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's only short), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing more than music, so music does only accompany their song.
They were behind the scene too.
Do I want to?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little of our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes, or just let these wings, the wings of love, carry us.
I also wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, no matter what the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything was put in place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already thrown this disc.
At this point, it is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is at risk for billions because of its inferiority complex
A dissimilar fraud.
Thus his former employee is the French giant General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
Instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to compare his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered incapacitating at all.
In contrast to all large bank houses, he temporarily recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's weak," they let his superiors hear who denounced him to the police.
However, if the Kerviel deposit reported by the French media, including Le Monde, that man's transactions have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the deposit.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win a half-billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February, according to which the mortgages said "sub-prime", given to low-income customers or to those who had encountered in the past the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did a good job.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
In all the interrogations, he may have made false reports so as not to be disappointed.
He managed to double his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Who takes no chances at all
Did he fear being discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple thing about getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does his will come from risking so big?
He just got to his position gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trade with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel explained.
But shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by putting this title down in London's attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather they doubted it.
"As long as I was winning, they seemed to close their eyes."
Now, it's when the start of the year happens.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how was it discovered?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days of leave.
A dealer who doesn't take vacation is a dealer who doesn't want to leave his book to someone else," Kerviel concludes.
Czechia on the occasion of obtaining 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources available by the Czech Republic in the framework of these projects.
This money will be the result of an increase in the budget of the National Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage an amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic was among the new members of the EU's most successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed today the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of the German country Arnold, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released and was assigned to reside in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on the period 1997-2002, is again incarcerated or not, according to the AP, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will either let Germany finish his sentence at his house, or he will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
It was fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that German had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The State budget has been adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was spent a year thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
In contrast to the aggrieved debate prior to the vote on the statement of opposition to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's a kind of paradox.
Whether you watch it or not, each chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is an integral part of the policy, although it is hidden behind the competition for opposition to government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Political men’s disputes are much more interested in the opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments would suffer from three woes that the current budget is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first is the important part of the bill's mandates, not only by withdrawals, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest allea.
It is both publicly and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the shortage of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, over and over again, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded in reimbursing these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatisation.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If only official and verifiable facts are kept, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing to sell.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they accused the State more and more.
Other countries, with few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are part of countries that are at the global level the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programs, which have, in the past few years, unfortunately in vain.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures, approved last year before the elections, have been successfully removed, if a drop in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the retirement system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is in power will only administer it.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men will become bureaucrats that distribute mechanically the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be borne by the costs of mandates.
The budget deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not disbursed all the money they could have.
If we really do not want policies to become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually reach a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and will also provide the European and Swiss Central Banks with $24 billion.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve major economic problems, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers of the Economic Council of Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other billions of losses.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still be done," says the economist at the head of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central Banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and exacerbate the American economy in a recession that could influence the economic growth of the world.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, even though the US, Canadian and English central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a new decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will contribute to conjure up the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is particularly harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism was this time at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not true, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, which is a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a word-out, changing solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that his subject was of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appeared in German translation, as he said, "I often encounter only the cartoon of my opinions".
Interested persons can now read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climate scientist, he does, in his opinion, have enough provisions to draw up such a book.
It is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is also economical.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the changing climate, the changes in it are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the evolution of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a totalitarian regime is concerned, it is unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and their benefits".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed time to expire and have failed to renew their old driving permit, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day on which people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will borrow the road without valid permits.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their license to drive especially those who did not want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities reported a fall in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital were seized of applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit was increasing this week.
The Mairie is satisfied with about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail in the middle of an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving license.
The issue of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a five-day period.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will borrow the road without a valid licence will risk a fine from January.
The defendant will be obliged to pay two thousand crowns at the maximum.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the amendment shall take 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, it was likely that even a person who was not going to circulate was a fine.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderately impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, according to him, a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not like with the identity card that, she must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also obliged to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old for renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties imposed by detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, former police officers accused of conspiracy with David Berdych's gang, will be sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences of 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were sentenced to 14 years and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years of imprisonment in other trials.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found that 19 persons were guilty of participation in detention, and the Supreme Court today dealt with 16 of them.
Most of the accused referred to the charge in question since the initiation of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulative case.
According to the Central Bohème Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various maintenance and helped gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang turned 30 percent of the larcine into Opava and Konňarík.
In the charge, there is a question of gang criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially of the armed flights, which the victims in most cases have suffered a serious health attack, but also the abuse of the power of a public agent and the prohibition of weapons.
In the case of domestic searches, the police have actually discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser beam or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang had tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already recognized the guilt of other flights by the Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men of the Berdych neighbourhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, and some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing, for the time being, avoided Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulaj who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision regarding their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The Children's Replacement Price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's ill-fed family lawyer wants to get 12 million crowns worth more from Trebíč's hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the hospital Ondřej Dostá is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," said Dostal at the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered.
We're going to check if this one has an explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonjov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the negotiations on damages.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different levels and depths.
The stress situation has been better sustained by men, although they have been faced with regrets that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, who are less likely to face the scourge of trauma in the present and what is happening right now, summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Trebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Primbyslavice and Veronica at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová at Jablonjov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region returned, at the end of October, to each of the families, 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the mistake of the hospital of Trebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to the law on civil liability insurance.
In the event of failure, they must be raised in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may ask for assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively little damage, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Foliage and loss of the Kingdom of Wales (le Regiment de Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka and I lost le litig auxmund de la marque Valašské krajnoj (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had actually used the title King of Valashko for the first time, but the project was launched by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško refer just to this actor and comedian to everyone.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it's the money that's the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
It's them who want to sit down on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used for the first time the title Valašský kral (Roi de Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this did not relate to the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of the Valašské Královówk.
From a humorous action originally it came out a business and lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation by Haraiš, of the company Valašské kralovj.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even proposed to the holders of the balances on the price of his farm visit and his theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has just used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manež show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Valash Kingdom," said the judge.
It added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and its team that would be devoted to the project intensively.
The cooperation between the enemies today continued until 2000 when Harabiši organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1 elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, claiming that the court has today rejected it.
What might make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He's supposed to be a new king.
He still didn't want to betray the details and the date.
"We don't want to go quickly into trouble.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovoácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course sign up," Harabiš added.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Loss of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, of driving and also of manufacturing could, in many respects, be qualified below the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor Peugeot 207, which is much better.
As much as the suite called SW goes a little further, I'm not left to think more about it.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
When you finish the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's see how fast it is.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly so it won't be too late to repeat it.
It's a design that's almost successful, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I'd like a design a little more inventive, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about too short seats or files is revolutionized.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the size of the bodywork is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head mentioned above.
A chest in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage support.
I need to assess this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear-glazed rotting ice) and a rather easy draw.
Blind spaces are equipped with arrest elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while it is able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This is done, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average number compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared to the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, it is found that the Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going abroad on leave or loading a purse, this figure is almost critical.
However, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box, which remains after the reversing of the rear seats files perfectly right, or a very low treadmill.
120 horses divided into four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1,6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
He is silent, consumes little and, above all, moves well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression that there is a hole in the hole by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's look at the prices.
The vehicle price is not accessible by all.
However, we must be aware that a well-equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
Now, we have also equipped head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ice-suppression, automatic command of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč at the end of the account.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left but to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is bad.
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is going to increase, leading to concerns about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now taking place in a series of obstacles.
British schools have even found cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the natives are transformed into violence.
The case of the North Kent, where the ongoing conflict of opposition and immigrants of Slovak origin began to accentuate, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes between students, Chicago and baccarats have been translated into relations between parents.
The situation went so far as the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old trainee with an iron bar.
The guilty one defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist talk.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we returned home, a young man grabbed on the bus stop and began to crack on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and peacocks and then he discovered his faces," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify for conflicts with immigrants in the struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to deteriorate.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect for your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and everything included with servers offering you a pizza, ice or many invigorating cocktails on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but rich.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the foundation of their invasion of the Americas.
Christophe Colomb qualified it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was erected in the early 20s.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its customers, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height have moved and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last 50's, circled on large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The business show stars and political men in the whole of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the National Hotel Bar, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since the jigsawils and the already imported fiats have long been in a climate so salty and wet, they can.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly depreciated, there is no other part of the surrounding area as many splendid colonial monuments as there is right there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
Over the last 15 years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, as well as to small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane was back from the extended plantations in the sugarcane on a narrow road by small trains with steam and motor.
Their rolling equipment has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives whose contemporarys are not only in museums can be seen.
Where's the leader?
Most visitors do not lack the best known places.
So there's no need to write it long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, recall that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vinales Valley on the west side of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation pushes it on a limestone floor.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks climb into the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile ground, they are caught in their traps, even its porous rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigarettes factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman has been turned.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth incarnates in the beauty and character of this small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, particularly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Scambray mountain, is a place so far away that in the last 50's, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay side by side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything anymore, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If one has more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música who is breathing after the sunset and where music only happens in the morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this castle located in the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way it leads.
The two roads from Guantanamo have to cross high and damaged mountains and cross an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in reality, it has seen the day almost a hundred years after the border of Colomb) and since the hill where the old chateau-fort and the current El Castillo hotel is held, there are several tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
With regard to the coffee, the rhum, the cigars, the massive Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Baie des triais and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, a number of pages could be filled.
It's just, like we're saying, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, says the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment needed, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should come up with a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it should, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are today also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States called this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates the NATO troops for greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the strengthening of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC channel.
Four-twenty-tenth per cent
The Afghan insurgent activity is, according to the U.S. military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
In particular, they require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has today held similar issues.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have nearly 40 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is not enough," De Hoop said to the Reuters agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo, which would last three days.
Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between countries involved in the issue if all allies actually do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British Sun tabloid qualified German soldiers as peers this week.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while our fighters," wrote Sun in a document completed by German soldiers playing at the tennis table.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British team during a Rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The government debt will amount to a billion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each of the Czechs.
The total debt is raised at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of a change in the economy of the best state budget, the department has reduced the estimated amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is raised by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, from June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its government debt data from early October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls to each Czech Republic.
Over the last year, the State has spent more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it appears that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for the next year, the limit of a billion crowns could be exceeded only in 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Vladimir Pikor's analysis is similar: "We could exceed the bill in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the political situation seemed to change, policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debt Increases
The debt of the State is the debt of the central government and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by assets of the Treasury, interest securities, direct loans, or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The State's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The State's average debt was 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half by 13 per cent, which is, in the light of current economic health, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by interest rates where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiations when the retirement reform comes," Pikora said.
Better than what we expected
It is the strategy for financing and managing government debt for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, the Department reduced the estimated amount to 152.8 billion crowns due to a change in the economy of the state budget.
The sum is essentially due to the government budget deficit, which is obviously going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion originally planned crowns.
This is then the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion crowns, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state rents for 43 billion crowns and the repayment of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
Today she appeared before a court in Khartoum to have named a bear in Khartoum
The British teacher who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced by a court in Khartoum last night to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, reported his lawyer.
The British was accused of letting students from 6 to 7 years of age give the name of Mahomet to a bear in battle while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a blow of lightning.
This 54-year-old British institute, based on the University of Khartoum in the Sudan, was arrested on Sunday and accused of assaulting Islam and seduction under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following several complaints from students' parents to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to the month of September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the pelvic bear of the class.
"Eight names come from the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", explains the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 chose Mohamed as the preferred name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself bore no label with that name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in the Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said only a "innocent mistake".
Notice shared by many students of the institution who describe it as “very attentive to its students” and “who never speaks of religion in class”.
Let us remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most named in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This surname often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (usually given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, I fail.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “in play”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not expect violence in the immediate but we go into a very difficult period”, he added, meaning that there are “evident tensions”.
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will take place last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the People's Province to 90% of Albanophones could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was commissioned by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Kartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of unusual administration in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is willing to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not support it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreements have been found," announced Kosovo's independent authority president Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden Hotel, where these "last chance negotiations" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Effect domino’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt for his part that a compromise was always predictable, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade said, among other things, to reduce a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be returned to the Security Council only, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu said that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian side would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the conference of international peace convened by his care in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations to find a final settlement of 60-year-old content between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do all he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would "be aimed at concluding a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This appeal covers the three pressing problems in the heart of the gratification between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were driven from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and cover all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In his tour to the court, Olmert was committed to making future talks "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to lock them up in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the date for the implementation of its "view of two Palestinian and Israeli States" coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush in this regard before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, which was set up by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saudi in his interview with the daily Arabicphone to Saudi capital.
The prosecutor is not responsible for the police.
What just happened, Sunday?
Like every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it traveled to 40-50 km/h, without girophare," explains a police source.
A green bike from the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to go public" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was "very living there".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says a police officer.
The control of alcohol applied to the occupants of the vehicle has proved negative.
The condition of the car (before detonated, starlighted, arched shocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation into the "involuntary homicide and non-help to the dangerous person" in the IGPN, co-existed with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of the Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the IGPN investigation at this stage was depriving police officers of responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of raining, no doubt caused by the melting of the ground-footed rails, showed that both vehicles remained covered when the police car got to stop.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, which said policemen would have quickly left their places, thus not giving support to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also avoid “all serious mistakes” regarding this point.
"This is an aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more research, which must be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met an eye witness of these moments who followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is nursed to the hospital, to try to take them down, tells this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely hagard police officer, who was fighting.
Two others tried to re-encourage one of the young, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that soon surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the people present had the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
Still, according to this witness, the relief arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the policemen”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services have not brought assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension goes up in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the emergency state two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who objected to emergency measures were injured by the lacrymogenic grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter have responded by throwing stones, hurting policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Cases similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been intertwined.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the destruction of those who had sworn in front of Musharraf'.
''Musharraf's promise is no longer true''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly addressed by the exemption measure announced Saturday night.
She had to vote in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to President Musharraf on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was avoided and replaced.
'All that we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's orders', the magistrate stated in The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the army and become a civilian president 'no longer' after the establishment of the emergency state, said on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
Leaving his military uniform was expected by 15 November, at the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani Government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armed Forces.
More than one third of the sizes remain unforeseeable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than three (36%) is not planned, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or steroid still present a 5% to 6% failure rate, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception also allowed for better fertility control, according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births of ten would be well planned today.
See calculated each month for a couple of five and, if possible, in the spring, the season considered as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a damaged solar panel, essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness of the living modules, the speed with which it was imagined, of the "bricking" tools by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, when astronauts had downloaded from Discovery the Harmony Module, a large cylindrical room to welcome soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of scoreboard for the lab modules.
But we need to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module of 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to place it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the refloating of solar panels of the module, which are 76 metres wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which expands like a deal, was damaged on about a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to make a checkout of the Discovery Ship, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters length of the remote arm of the shuttle added to the station to make the repair.
It's one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very flat, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was therefore charged with "operating" the solar panel "damaged".
After carefully inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fault cable and installed some kind of "athletics" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker left near the saddle and, from inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool used by him, a mini-hockey channel wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a half-day vacation before today, seven astronauts return to Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The sanctions against EADS in Borse
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Air and Defence Group announced that it would spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% to EUR 21.96 at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 following the delays caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of delaying the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion of which is more than 1 billion for Airbus'', announced the European manufacturer's mother's house EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be obliged to announce new operational result (EBIT) targets for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, it will add no further figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
The operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, or authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed voters today a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is being declared disastrous.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, happy to provide a new charge against the accused West of interference - his theme of predication during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and we want fairer, more transparent and more open elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
It denounces a pressurized campaign.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been "no election as salt, even at the time of Eltsina".
After the repression of last week's events, the ex-champion of the failure world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
Behind these unscrupulous legislation there are two more open issues:
- Who's going to take the presidency to Putin?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the Presidential, on 2 March 2008 and the candidates have until 23 December to get to know each other.
Election in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot challenge a third consecutive mandate.
But no successor ever leaves.
- What role would Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful Russian party who would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, the legislative as well as the presidential, the power that emerges triumphs.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has refused with the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population as long as this new paternism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic relief," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "refused fully to personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What's a good idea?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will no longer vote for the extremists.
A 54 - year - old professor named Tamara Cherednitchenko concluded: “What good is it to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi archives, which portray the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are available free.
The 47 million archived documents, stored 27 km from a line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only to be consulted for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say, individually and nominee, on the request of an old victim or his rightholders.
The eleven States in charge of their management - Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominations because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if possible, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technische Universität de Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nat.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission to launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trade partner, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact works enormously on both economies" and "India would improve its access to a well-developed 450 million European market," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner stated. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "EUR 47 billion of goods" and for "EUR 10 billion of services", said Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet again on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England said that Thursday was concerned about facilitating the current return of credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its contribution of reserves foreseen during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open five-week market operation," she said in a communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the basic rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time the BoE seems to place liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it "is willing to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans today online with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 per cent on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been subject to an important penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book's course compared to the euro, many have preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
As part of a socialist "neighbor" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text reduced a dozen measures adopted by the GSP national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of floating TIPP, a check-transport or the rental framework.
UPP and NC voting against the review of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was raised at the end of the general discussion, which resulted in trades, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The Chief of Staff of PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft law on corrective finance reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British Melvin Benn Producer's Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 is produced by the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Ben has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying the "most inspiring event" that he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Ben are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are trapped in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we learn to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will last serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having moved to the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a champet festival, while ours are rather in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a European and American-urban festival."
Vineland is almost halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, wholeheartedly supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states that "they are sufficiently interesting to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "too large", as it were of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were launched to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of the press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will vary, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Award Promotion of the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movies to Montreal when no one else opposes Terminator...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to play in the “Governator” Pats?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where she's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he said.
The Festival Race
At the moment, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is to promote the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Coast, whether that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting Québec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors are interviewing.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year stock exchange? The experts divided by the subprime crisis.
Within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year, investors are already laying their hands on the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties look at markets, at least on the short term."
Although they are not partial in order for the stock exchange to take over the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock exchange market is fed through liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the flow effect to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "particularly because we do not know the impact of the likely decrease in Fed's rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index ended at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this view so negative.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to retirement schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be slightly different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution's feast (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst for Investment Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebounding of the index that could be triggered on the basis of information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year's great values are coming back to him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
As far as Federico Olucha is concerned, Bank's Investments ensures that the increases will be from bank to industry.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, where they are placed there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explained.
cyclic consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions in December was a month of decline.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the detection of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6,68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (Ibex has now increased by 8.36 per cent since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its final year run.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday at 12 noon
The People's Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, as it was the first group to begin to agree on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies up to 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20:30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to increase the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about concluding an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other organizations to join this initiative that coincides with trade schedules.
That is exactly what the People's Bank is looking for.
To attract the autonomous customers that travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the streets they choose to open.
The Bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing agencies.
To this end, the Agency will modernise its existing branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the various streets.
In this way, the amplifying of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but the recruitment of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Grand Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others working under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they do not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the time being, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in Borse de his rival Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a representative adviser of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closure of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of her joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have fallen less', he said.
However, he stressed the fact that in a low market, ' we have fallen less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54 per cent progression.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15,66% for a year.
The value in Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% plus) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its rival Antena 3, which has contributed 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we will make it possible for us to hear it.'
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary who manages the advertising of the group.
In order to ensure that this information is true, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent for the current fiscal year in its advertising bill compared to the 2006 fiscal year.
Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Borse is the important pay that he has so far maintained: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profits among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have an official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market currently gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This was due, as they explained, to a decrease in expected growth of 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenne’s profit forecast by 3 to 4,5 % in 2008 and by 7,5 % in 2009.

The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and allow the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies in order for markets to function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the Directors of the National Market of Values Commission (NCMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social and legal reasons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which integrate value companies, value agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of financial instruments operating systems, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services undertakings to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all their operations in order to facilitate CNMV control.
By passing through the Congress Economic Commission, a number of amendments have been added, one of which shows that the debt holders will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk to the investor, which has been shown by what has happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (subpress).
In addition, they benefited from the transposition of the management was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economy may have 30 years after the Royal Decree, which demarcated the professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and which will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases from five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a review of price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it must not necessarily coincide with the final data to be revealed on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the increase of 4.1% of IPC in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in Congress' corridors that "even though the figure is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation with regard to the monetary union continues to be "more or less" as it has been in recent years.
He also explained that in November, "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such an increase.
"We expected a figure around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economics in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin's plan to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock's deposits have dropped by more than 50% to $12,000 (€16,800 million) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he had recorded a few deposits of over 25,000 million books, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government had provided and that it would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would appoint the organization with her financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18 000 million remaining books to reach the goal of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Magnet Group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million books (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of Virgin's association, to which three other companies participate, including her preferred to save her from the bank trip.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard today, early in the morning, arrested the current mayor of the Murcian Municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current member of the right, and until then the mayor's municipal adviser, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
Agents continue to search for municipal premises and those of the Council of Urbanism, and the possibility of new arrests is not missed in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, chief suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the chain SER to the lawyer of the 'popular party' MP Juan Morales, he was arrested from the home of Morales with the important documentation in his property concerning the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged encumberment of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a construction company in Galice to re-equilibrate 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the election
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the Spanish Socialist Party's organization secretary José Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who presides over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made his decision on 15 November last to refrain from presenting himself to the next general elections and to abandon his political career to focus on combating climate change in the academic framework.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government had not stopped insisting on returning to the political front guard since he left him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the election, his party wanted to announce the one who presides over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or of cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak peacefully and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate has been interrupted on some occasions 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge to do" and did not want to do as if he had already taken his position to avoid falling, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to unhappily persecution, both the skepticism of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
It is so much more the case for a movement leader who is president of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach must explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has contributed in a decisive way to Spain being the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of Kyoto protocols.
Those responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors it has produced and why its Government, the one in the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Exactly because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individuals' accounts.
Up to one hundred of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he pushed him away.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that don't speak, who doesn't denounce and who doesn't demand, who embraces meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we move in bicycles or refresh ourselves with the possibility.
Mayor and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for a alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the Mairie and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today reported sources of the investigation.
The City Councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many officers met at the moment, who also presented themselves to the Urban City Council and to the Municipal Management Company of the Industrial Sun and Housing.
These three orders are added to the last six orders made on Monday in the provinces of Galice, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of over 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housings after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislation.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged with the judicial investigation, as instructed by the Court No. 1 of Totalana.
The first six detainees have now passed to court.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is addressed by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current bailiff of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontavedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonaure, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine pots would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority of companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a highly known avian product company in the region, which could have played the intermediary role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been re-qualified and its project would be to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomoyar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (some of the PISA information heads above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the Blackburn book:
"The content of the Philosophy course interfered with public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Adviser, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools."

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Penal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a punishable offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight to a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered only as a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight to a store for a value up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed on the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you fly a car and pay it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a bakery than to participate in traffic in compact discs.
Participating in an intruder involves a sentence of three months per year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD traffic would involve a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film under section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth then someone is exaggerating.

My doctor told me about one of his foreign research articles: 'The money produces brain activations, especially if the others receive less '.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest Science issue.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Institute of Life&Brain, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people found that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been imploding the Balkan war criminals since the Public Ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague for eight years.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will enjoy a bitter taste because the chief leaders of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are listed in this list by the documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, the list of Carla ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York, who pursues fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments involved to withdraw the circle.
What kind of insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is actually made, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that the more likely an accident is to occur, the higher the rate to be paid.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of ills than they do.
In the same way, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing frequency the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that suits his profile best.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and driving licence age.
Although the ideal for being well assured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most predictable drivers can choose for insurance any risk with franchise, so that they get coverages of insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the client pays part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the damage the client will face will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of the First Europe insurance intermediary in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer can ensure protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are a 25-year-old, try to be careful and avoid the harms as much as possible, as this will affect the benefit, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A grant is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is a increase in the basic rate.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and on the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to increase the bonuses," explained Noguera.
Over the last 25 years, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, as the rate of disasters is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance at any risk with franchise.
" Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience of the previous accident, " ensures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the news has passed. "
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as soon as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are viewed by insurers as people with the lowest rate of disasters, because the majority will be weaker.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk-free insurance (may be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of funding.
"They have a more uncontracted conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a more important amount of franchise," judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance is preferable (being EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that we need most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the League of Champions, as it serves Italians to be the first and the Scottish to be the first.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day with a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC must dispute the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan in 13 of this month in search of a place by the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at their home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eight finals.
A failure of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk won't win, but it won't only computer on it because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanians would try to poison the night to the Scottish, who hoped to be classified for the eighth final for the second time at the League Champions, after having been beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rosonry' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, if Celtic lost, to be classified for the eighth final to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of pursuing European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said little time before they started their concert at the GM Place stage in Vancouver that the group meeting was "blilliant".
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the history of the group that raged at the end of 1990 was reported.
The meeting and the world tour coincided with the launch of a new album that resumed their main success as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage by showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
' Sporty Spice ', which is part of the band in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which led to the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw the feeling of people changed, the feeling of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate very much".
But many things have changed since Spice Girl was last shown in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
At their arrival at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They have five sons for her.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be shown in California, the United States, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
They will appear in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute on the gas price fermented between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are driven by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had led to a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-provided monopoly company, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of the Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine since it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supply from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts stated that this would include an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 resulted in the interruption of the supply of Gazprom to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, increasing prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'should control its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Health of Scotland needs to improve controls to be carried out on its extra community employees to verify whether they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
The General Reviewer's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern about the fact that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no specific data on the number of people working overseas.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The reviewer-general carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack of the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, Iraqi doctor of origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, at the doors of the main terminal.
He was a member of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permit for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Dissolver to carry out criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer-general's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Pre-Failure Control, thus enabling employers to carry out controls on different countries.
"Although we have found that some information on staff has been well verified, this has not been done every time." The report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he would do himself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some members of overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, stated that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks can identify employees who are likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said, "The report suggests that pre-employment controls currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities have declared that 1161 people from overseas are employed, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
However, the reviewer-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part due to problems related to the identification of staff with indefinite contracts, which could be chosen or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for control of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are perfectly appropriate.
These checks shall be carried out on a passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment checks for personnel outside the ocean of the health service.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at the airport of Glasgow."
It added that the Government of Scotland associated with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including those from abroad.

Winstone said he was proud to receive this prize in honor of the star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admirably in front of this great current actor, I was extremely honored"

Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia declared yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells carrying an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on the ecclesiasticals and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggling cells.
The supporters of Al Qaeda have launched a campaign against the United States monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on a oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000 military group to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 arrested persons belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It was said that the militants were planning the eight-milieu band in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees seem to have completed the assassination of ecclesiasticals and armed forces.
The Government asked the ecclesiasticals to do more against Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and the Shiite Muslim government allied to the United States, considered heretics according to the hard line of Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda's militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiasticals have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and power supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months" said the Minister of Interior's speech door on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medieval organization in a "mediatic cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against the unfaithful and apostatized Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European orbital ship have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that over billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could even have been inhabited.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation associated with a slower rotation has led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today, the planet is deprived of water, destroyed by hurricanes and storms of light and has a warm surface to melt the lead.
The discovery of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
The professor of physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets in them are practically similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that there were billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, could even be with a living surface."
Of uranium enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently from uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak police and Hungarians yesterday.
One police officer said that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was good uranium, but found that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to all
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowflake.
Despite this, Republican candidates to the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate on YouTube, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate on You Tube, when a snow bungalow asked the Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
We do not know what criteria the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen the You Tube clips to show the applicants.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest dealing with one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The government saw approval increases when the candidates expressed themselves in a large way.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of the major upcoming elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was concurring about clandestine immigration during his mandate as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the Massachusetts, of using clandestine immigrants in his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an "amnesy" (supposing clandestines to a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Young candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to deepen this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both of them remain in the race, can be thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and in a more intense way than others.
In general, candidates, at least as far as immigration is concerned, have the same views: more stringent borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, linked to the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other subjects have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We didn't expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - to declare that the death penalty is painful as much as necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to all.
The reconstruction of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the siflings during the Wednesday debate.
These two are emerging from the infant, thanks to the fact that the two protections of the party do not agree to decide which candidate is the most known and more traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the part of good time and convincingly through a message of success on the American size thus approaching the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which he's shadowing; even if he's resigning, the situation wouldn't change.
In view of the trend in British scandals, it is not particularly judicious.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no sucquered extra foot finger.
But here's a revelation that a rich man of business would have masked his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), for four years, that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back to his election project, foolishly insulting the British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, instead, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal leader of democracy, said that the terrorist Mr. Brown had turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, has shown a lack of guidance and a mild judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trial of retired generals has launched a rebellion among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military expenditures: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At the present time, the suspicion of foolish donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Workers (and his former head of oversight) made them have to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is heading unmanufacturedly towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are balancing; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he wanted to repel Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was a chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misery, such a long investigation into the funds of the "counter money for the members of the House of Lords" party could be the opposite.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims and no scruples.
And the cure, although painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies at all times, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his well-being.
He may have his opinion, but it is not for him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of major contributors of politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has the right to know what contributes to the success of those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, who was responsible for the collection of grants that had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But so far, Mr Brown is not involved: nothing makes him think that he has been aware of these approaches, even though most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival to the government in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law is broken, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent president for the Independent Committee of Public Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a participant, Mr Brown.
But it should deal with some partial facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it is two years old to re-elect the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreconcilable integrity and strong skills.
You scratched cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see waiting swimmers, wander around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the predators are going to the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in cost and insolvency rates, which measure the non-recovery or non-recovery parts of the balance sheet, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credits to the consumer, partly due to the weakness of card carriers.
He's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencys are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is less than one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States, regarding the personal banking system, caused a sudden fall in the banking records, which in turn caused heavy losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions were to be imposed.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt that consumers need to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that the equity loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flows of species rather than to the value of the property, so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to pay for the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of the actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a consequent decline.
If the lower real estate prices and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal swimmers..
British bankers blame for the case Enron.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, accusing guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusory fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial search to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They should appear before the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain due to two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a pending question for this investigation, which was launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that they had been charged in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that it was the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, named after the "three of Natwest" claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the founder of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him find the banker's procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the branch as nothing, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £ 1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest to this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the branch.
But in fact, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow complained guilty of his active role in two conspiracys in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow continues a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of $1 million each, which forces them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, in banking in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of debt and even propose its two-year speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of dismissals, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Schilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Law for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been grounded as a result of his death due to a heart attack last year.
You don't come out, you don't come out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Golfstream plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a scale from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Golfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats since it's more than a family-use plane or for the president of a society."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream Station on Friday, last Friday, at the Millionaires Hall, a consumer-incentive orgy for four days, which was held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Golfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their various products, going from yachts to diamond-filled cars like 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was looking for a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product" he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to a oil boom, Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, such Dallas"
"We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior member of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
As the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the largest global spending.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 million Russians, totaling $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(the World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, that's why we're all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jewelryman.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents placed on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who was wearing her high-end clothes like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to focus on the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to boil in their mouths to come to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to the Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice tables, custom billiards tables, apartments in Dubai and gong bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, who sits proudly at the Royal factory stand for manufacturing Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a Rambrant wall table on blue reels, handmade.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers stated here that Russians with old capitals (10-15 years old are too old according to Russian standards) have already passed logos that explode to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold in the living room.
In spite of this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are suffering from exposure every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, Thursday last, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil's beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and gold threaded cotton.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycles, a company that teamed cars with last cry alarm systems, also told him to sell to a millionaire Russian, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said that he would sell three cars similar to bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantums, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be engraved with Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants atrocious leather wheels, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it is not in cash," he said.
"there is more than you can think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel that emotion when they go to the Stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company raised four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Salon.
Passers arrested to launch a mass of tickets, asking their photographers friends about their mobile phone, to the beautiful middle of this false wealth or to push a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Non-approved surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the guard of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the glass bay of the restaurant just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Code on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingstone, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, that the police have not yet identified, resident in 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they expect reliable results from the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should allow this mysterious death to be solved by the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant officer of the police chief, Garry F. Mc Carty, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacity," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"She would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who was working for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11 years old, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking of the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was dead because of an unauthorized surgery.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation is continuing."
The authorities said they had arrived at her home at 3 p.m.
and found Melle Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
Wednesday, no one opened the door at Melle Castro, where a fan of roses lay in the top of the cemetery, and a Dalmatian lay in the back.
A blue bowl called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, was placed in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two bikes all over the coast.
McCarthy stated that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you must be careful about this" he told.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the emergence of the world stock exchange.
The shares were exploded on the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market expected the Federal Reserve to try to settle the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the ancillary statements of the Vice President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the busy financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irretrievable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence had in part "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe disturbance was to persist, this would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into American markets, and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilise credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the American economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated following Bear Stearns' statement, an investment bank, which announced that it would license 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for heavy losses due to the loss of real estate loans.
20 posts are only provided for in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, reaching 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, was 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 received 165,5 points, or 2,7%, reaching 6306,2 adding more than 39 pounds to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the reopening of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a three-month sale of funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the EDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions led to the three-month "Libor" loan rates of the British banks, resulting in higher growth since September, at 6.59% following a strong rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal for judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electors who were there exceptionally to help Peter Moore, the coach manager, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris, the president of England's Director-General, began to fill out the application forms to become a national electorate, at least in part time.
The one who won't win the No.6 file will be malicious, but life is often unfair and sport is also wrong.
It is never easy to deny what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of chance more than a lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to get Bopara out?
Is that right with Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new managers who have obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be prom: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be able to touch the cricketer one day.
But catching the eyes of the voters is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was in full shape and continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both had already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hoped to offer yet.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stage, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could go away or build a man's career, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the test's primary critic, and this, despite the fact that his double-cent mark against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya stage, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the innings of the 88 test in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class against six for Bopara, who at the age of 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the voters when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have hit his elves so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing made him afraid of a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently captivated a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alasair Cook, his crew who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is far from the best drummer, his stringed allure allows him to perform services that go to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of the selection?
I would prefer to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if such tea leaves suggest he will be the one who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dispossessing these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had found normal.
Some have come to fight the militants who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in dozens of official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seeing the city more sure now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to withdraw for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Amariyah area dominated by Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called on him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia had driven Al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the leader of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming back today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing acclimate of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in the view of continuing training of well-armed "citizen groups" and working with American soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decency of Damascus's capital, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled over the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian Government to limit its efforts to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to give no more visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been hunted out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not increase the sectarian tensions again and bring back the fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state conducts vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time at a no Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-defence, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Sarre, which is the fifth in the training monitor of the German Economic Institute of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or a triple degree.
There is a high ratio of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools in numbers higher than the average - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one young person in five gets his degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are thus relatively well developed.
According to the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparative tests in all federal states.
In order for the children to start learning early, the last harvest year is free of law - a model that is also copied by other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performances are improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the risk ratio was reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states have.
The Bavarians are getting better off.
And in spite of the sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - one could gain points in this field.
Because neighbor's language is mandatory in the lyceans - even if the sarrois are not French.
Manipulate watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will set up a half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, because of a new law, the watches will be regulated at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring country, Colombia, due to a housing case.
The nationalist on the left announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who had a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country would have to vote by Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crashed on the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chavez Sunday.
In Spain Chavez is also in all mouths.
A new sound of mobile phone rages in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry with the constant interpillars of left-wing populists who told him to stop.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, according to a forecast, a real less-value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payroll compared to the previous year in 2007.
"Failure is due to low wage development, increased value-added tax and increases in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Economic Research, in the "Build" newspaper.
New burdens could also arise in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in the process of asking the Federation for funds or financial assistance, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased inflation to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent per year to each other.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than what we have thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has revealed light in the atmosphere and wind turbines to the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today has given evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus sparkle at an altitude of about 56 kilometres of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, the lights would have revealed life on Earth: the eagle would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should not be much living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the search for Venice, as no more probes have been on the way to explore this planet for the past four to twenty-ten years.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of Nature not only highlight Venus uniqueness within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than expected in the first place.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the North Pole, a storm of clouds in the South Pole, which is moving much faster.
The phenomenon reminds air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piconi de l'Instituto di Astrofisica Spaciale e Fisica Cosmica Italiani.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres, almost as large.
The star-qualified planet of the night or the morning revolves around the sun for just 225 days.
It, however, moves much slower on itself: a Venezia day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with an area temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets are made in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, calls for the end of the party's queer on the reception of the Dalai Lama in Chankelerie.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and is the great coalition of chlorine on the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present in the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (CDU) chancellor in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy in China.
The German chancellor did not take its distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly informed his discontent about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, in particular, about the "deviation policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in Chankelerie, virulent irritations occurred in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only ordered German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also reported on the Spiegel, has also frozen the dialogue on the strategy of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.
The head of the Chinese government, Wen Jiabao, now demands the German chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses European political men to receive Tibet's spiritual leader in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble cautions against emotions such as those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
All must be implemented so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
The German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar change in Germany after the serious riots of young people in France.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not present at our own expense and is disbanded in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The federation, the federation and the communities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"The summits of integration to the conferences on Islam already show its first success."
But it would be too soon for an end of alert.
Schäuble points out that at the same time as in German flags, there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people were given heavy street battles with the police during the last few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater efforts to integrate the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Taking into account the emus in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more training places first and foremost.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families was more prevalent in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called out, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "invited to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian Faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
The post authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and pubs.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, the Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots came to Toulouse.
The emu exploded after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance to the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there is nothing more to wait for it.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After his desperate intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said that it is not here - not here in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The too-focused approach to politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptive phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed by saying that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it visible to all the extent to which this complaint was accurate.
There was no specific interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
On the other hand, Angela appeared as a cloud: a politician who went into foreign politics and who remained there in almost any way.
For example, the protection of the climate: in this respect, it still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even so, self-reproach - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it adheres to formulas all made, that growth would touch people.
This is where she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves the problems rather than overthrowing the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Children's poverty and low-paid workers' concerns?
There are a few phrases available to him for this.
In this respect, the number of times she makes laps when it comes to family allocation is revealed.
Here, Merkel needs three starting points to make a half-precise sentence.
It titube in unknown land, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Branch Attack
In the debate on Youtube of Republican candidates to the presidency, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering themselves to a tough offensive battle - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already in the first place.
He would have made New York a "refugee for the clandestines," Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He is against his side by heavy reproach: "I would say that his own home was a haven for clandestines," Giuliani replied and rebuked the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favor, the eight candidates to the presidency are discussing CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via YouTube are hardly more than fans.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come into power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also learns strongly by the veterans of Vietnam, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go between time and time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg community hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, the abbreviations differ in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at this time," explains Romney contradicts and presents his excuses to the base and television audience for having yet to become a part of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on Scriptural interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rule for the first time in civil.
One day after his retirement as the leader of the armed forces, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
That's how eight years of military domination ends.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
The Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus joined international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his taking power through a bloodless pusch, the former general now rules for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state that Musharraf decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus meet another West requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with judges of his rank, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the North Tribal Region in North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other wounded.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers do their return.
The super-groups of Germany in the 1960s are happy: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, there were records of their great success "Live 1974".
By this time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three messengers announced at the evening show.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable, and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the middle of a white shirt as snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, 57-year-old and owned by a portable computer and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, runs on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the Members themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has ensured some emotions among Krautrock's lovers.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so long as this group has been in pain for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends in the 1960s?
More and more than what is called atrocious "Krautrock" has more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in Panegyric praise, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the power of impact that felt was much lower than what was then attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly hung in Kraftwerk and had finally become a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
About 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in the woods of Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-and-so there was in the trash a fan of the Harmonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many hold harmony away from it.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because it was also serie and fashionable that music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood wasn't for himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone who remembers.
Rother released at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and will ensure his existence with such albums as "Flamende Herzen" (inflammation hearts).
Cluster reanimates in the four-year-olds and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We need the Live album from Griesem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
New! had already been demolished on this occasion like Roedelius's personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be marked with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be completed by Harmony.
Brian Eno's phrase plans in the room in the middle of single sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of barbaric cable tools are used in the formation of legend.
First, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to draw the instruments of the sound of the sound by means of the instruments with self-constructed effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
All three of them in great technical fines.
That's why the house's chorus will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we get to the sound cloud, and we sing at a beautiful time "Aaaaaaah" with the emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatives (Can), in the technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is also now no longer getting angry with it.
But what goes on most of you will be covered in a minute on the scene.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give away some moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynic enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films re-approach the Balkan War.
But they both don't believe it.
So the projects rely too much on action and on the trade of insanity or on whether they are too alarming.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certain war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are always hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the country's most greedy backdrop of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the four-year-olds, because too many nice and funny roles in women-sensitive films and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism pleased him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at yet "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunt (why today's films must be as long and confused as collective conventions of drivers of locomotives?)
He gives a wonderful representation full of eyebrows: in the bottom, his character to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not as welcome: a man who has his best moments long ago behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, still kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But in spite of this attack, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Killer", which also succeeds this week, the endless follow-up of films on the Balkan War.
The trial can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of the Kosovar francs, in which one of the two falls still quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film is as flat as a film loses too fast in action and insanity.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good film on the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to punish the high war criminal "the renard", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look striking: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one simply does not let Simon Hunt be the disoriented cynic with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" finally gets bad, when, in the last five minutes, it's an accelerated process that finds that NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: to capture the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Hague Criminal Court should be seized against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to deny that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to lead the hunt in a rather intense way because of secret political agreements.
But the intent and the evil are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a mask in wood of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compassion, I see the veins of the inflated front, clearly: as it is tiring to be evil."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same tuxedo heads, but they imply to what extent it's tiring to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
You can add: there have never been any good films in South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star draws on a crisis house or on a mine field, it then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arcette, "Jenseis go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be just too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have always passed before Hollywood can play a good movie on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to be well-married - those who today enjoy classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated solely at their time as labor leaders.
But maybe in our knowledge today we're just too much on the world's conflicts, where every hectotombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this gave the screenwriters the lack of scruples they need to tell nice stories.
"Being or not to be" or "The dictator" have become as good as it was because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need the sarcastic artistic look and distance from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dicionaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It only holds that certain things never change."
"The great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects the criticism for the abolition of the Olympics.
The mayor's resignation of Hamburg's candidacy for Summer Olympics was a success in politics and the economy with critical virulents.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sportive role could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "who takes as starting point another modified agenda".
Major Ole von Beust left it on Wednesday to his previous statements, which said the Olympic ambitions in Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said Von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December regarding Munich's application for 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the time we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream did not ultimately belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the candidacy would be in contradiction with the statements made by the Head of the Senate on the occasion of the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
Down there, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application to the 2015 Universities as "no substitute" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first been named Hamburg in the past weeks as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD party appealed to the Senate not to have used this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Little Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would only have put on the "Event factor".
The application for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have a great enthusiasm for its part in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken up against Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
He who connects Sweden's concepts and falls in wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the Warhol works list.
A large part of the four-twenty-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol's 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum of Stockholm today results in a dissertation: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave in 1995 at the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which are circulating on the international market of art.
The old history is covered, a search for artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap cartridges.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - of hundreds of boxes made of cardboard: they did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not art works here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were not otherwise exposed to the Moderna Museum.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden cassettes that at that time would be right in the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, on the contrary, that about one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given it up.
In fact, the 105 Hutén caisses were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, CEO of Moderna Museum, examined three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a paint brush to white oil.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that painting was directly applied without background layer on stratified panels, using a paint roll - it is not a painting on the oil, but a acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says the Director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/materials of exhibition."
Already in July, the Board's Authentication announced that it would investigate the "glorious accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been down there with an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandoning
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandon, the same ones who had settled in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any blood transfusions.
The faithful soldiers in power had just taken the hotel with the help of lacrymogene gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been retreating for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to a lack of pupsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillans.
It takes advantage of the hearing to slip suddenly with about 30 sympathies.
The military policemen, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently been devastated in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Reliable troops in power buoyed the sector around the hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other units of the army were about to join the march.
The regime's criticisms had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the theatre of the attempt to mutiny about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection breaks almost 24 hours after the army refuses to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to push against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet participated more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per action is EUR 14.46, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This does not seek to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made about an entry on Wednesday, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is reported on the market.
The watch, the United Internet had already acquired a participation of nearly 10 percent in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As a result of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares of a value of EUR 106.4 million in Borse.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation on the marketing of DSL products and mobile phones.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the SME participation company in order to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and do not use their right to enclosing 18.49 percent more in Freenet, they trusted the United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all open options, in particular to increase their participation in the Freenet SA, we have learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet, which has lasted for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million clients linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch had so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide about four per cent additional.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
