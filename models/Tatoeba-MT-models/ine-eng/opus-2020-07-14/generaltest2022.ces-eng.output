The great return of the Czech smurf is coming.
Pavel Francouz was invited to NHL
Czech hockey bran Paul Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to NHL.
A 20-year-old stepparent will be at the center and he could get to the market soon.
An ex-prisoner of Lithuania, Plzno or Russian Čeljabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Right in the middle of the strike with Vegas and since then, he hasn't been present at the NHL key yet.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced barber moved from one point to another.
"Paul Francouz will be about three to four weeks with an injury in the lower part of the body," the whole of Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL market was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was invited from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, it signed 94,5 % of the progress.
A pulsary hockey survivor finally wants to reassess and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his jaws and in a short pandemic year he didn't get the only hit.
In the NHL "France", 36 matches were fired, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles at Christmas's request is touching Camille's pig, William and Kate are setting up in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife, Kate, as this year's Christmas wish, chose a family photo taken on a trip to Jordan.
He also published his wishes to Prince Charles, who used a photograph to help his cousin Camille put in a pot.
On her website, the British BBC news station reported that.
They send love to friends, to employees, and to the hopes they cooperate with.
The photograph was created in the desert area.
The duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaka color and dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shirts as Prince George and Louis and a shirt with a tie.
Who ordered the photograph, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when it came up.
Last year's royal family for photography intended as a Christmas wish invited to a package of straw before a pile of wood in its rural settlement in Norfolk County.
The image, which serves as a Christmas wish, has also been published by the successor of Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at Ascot's arrivals.
Charles, who has a cylindrical head on his face, helps Camille put her powder on a colourfully decorated coat.
Slavia, according to eftobal.cz, promised Berbro a million per title, the fortress denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the defendant's former mayor of the football association ČR Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for the league title from Prague in 2018/19.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about it by getting to a part of the police records.
The chairman of the executive board of Jaroslav Tvrdík stated that the red tapes were not allowed to engage in any corruption.
The server published a review of police replies, in which her former sports director, Jan Nezmar, from Slavia, was mainly represented.
One of the most influential red-haired officials was, according to the letter in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director at the time of the second-legged Vyšehrad Roman Rogoze, who is also in charge of the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for receiving the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that, for the victory in the league, Roman (Berbr) had a promised millions of fees from SK Slavia Praha officials, quoted the server from the list.
The day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the President of the Government of Slavia Durdík.
The list on the server is no longer valid as to whether this information is still being handled by the police.
The plaintiff rejected any corrupt conduct.
In 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the dimensions in the Czech football and offered the opposite alternative to its development.
We have never been allowed to commit an illegal act, have not tried to influence decision-makers against fair play rules, and have not given anyone any financial performance in this regard," the Reportlist said.
In envoys, among other things, Nezmar does not selectively insult some of the former players of the glory of darkness, and he also speaks of his former head, Durdík.
The cause of the alleged impact of the fights through the decision-makers has released in the mid-October police intervention in several places including the Prague seat FAČR.
The highest in the afé is Berbr, which no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In the middle of January, as was the former sports director of Vyšehradu Rogoz, he was released from prison.
The helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the shooters must carry the belts manually without covering).
Car - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various panzer vehicles - at a decent level, also managed to get rid of Prague V3S and specialized units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rent, transport - very small with a short but modern flow.
Drony - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
GDP: medium-sized, ageing; short-term - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got Honitbu right next to the city.
They went down the river and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to do a brothel, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something went out, but of course the fox went in a minute.
I let her reach 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, had his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the shelf.
Before I got out of the crew, he was a fireman.
Mr. and the loco man is a prussiar.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of chance to do something, you'd probably be seeing in a thermovise that's got almost everyone today.
So, in a visible place, dear thing comes to your feet and you should be fine.
Fighters versus Hamaček.
In the interior, mirrores received significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The State responsible for the purchase and distribution of pigs, masks and breathers for the profession near coronavir, issued billions of crowns on their devices in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts on the mirror were down to a hundred crowns.
Why are prices so dramatic?
Which offices were treated economically?
And why did others buy the wire?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to the editor of the iRozhlas Dominik Kubisht server.
Soldiers and armies are weighed (I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, which have passed through the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have a large stock of techniques that can be understood by training, we don't actually have modern technology or for existing professionals, and modern technology is increasingly complex, so the ability of depositors will be lost quickly in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where someone can plant it, they'll be playing very fast, there's no time to practice again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences have a major role to play in countries such as Ukraine, where they are going to lead a mass giraffe, and this is also an expression of the need to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, fighting will only take place in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where it will be irrelevant, and we have no proper geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is, half of them play, like they have it.
Then put in a situation like that, you see a guy who doesn't go back to the empty gate for two minutes, he's going to attack himself between two or even three shifts, and you're saying, "Tvl and what do you think's going to happen?"
Of course, they will choose him as the average taxpayer.
This situation with this understanding of "behind the defender" is so terrible that I agreed to be honestly surprised when I see our attacker managed to win one of the players.
First estates
The Covid pandemic slows down, but experts for the following weeks don't expect any major return.
Efforts in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and have come to the pandemic equation, as we know, a new unknown: a variant of micron, which is very likely to spread faster than currently ruling Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, as much as it helps the pancreas or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease treatment.
But this week also entered an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the plus: treatment option.
A new drug, antivirotikum molnupiravir, has been reached in Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation of a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which from today's results reported a success of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries to Czech Republic, however, apart from the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against coronavir pandemic, raised the question of how the future drug is prepared by the administration.
As it has been said, the first to receive molnupiravir from Merck in foreign patients.
The company ended up on the belt as the first and because the medicine began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
In this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often reminded of this.
they are generally less open and clearly do not share their views.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and in particular us Czechs, we're used to speaking "how our teeth have grown".
See, you're gonna do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
Most people in Czech Republic will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist hooves.
And then they go and choose sides like AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this to the public means losing work and the media lynch.
Then in the research, it looks nice, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Penová and Zemmoura, both have a survey of more than 20%.
We even know that the objects are all three identical in Czech.
Identical because of the precision of units, so that soldiers don't have to learn where they are again, so all objects on the head are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda is that the ssr didn't want to have a nuclear head on his own territory, either for reasons of safety or for speeding up the setting of the heads for a more Western position.
In these underground roofs (there are two in each yard) only the heads were kept, not the whole rockets, as they are called.
If it was necessary to place this weapon, a special unit came up and mounted this head on some portable device.
In addition to the museum yard, they're in a dismal state.
At the second level of elementary school, we had a partner of Cigan, for four years we were with him.
He was totally fine, made good jokes, often when he showed up too much, but it was our mask.
He was dealing with everyone, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he went regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he didn't steal candles, or the phones, he was just dressed.
He went to school in the field, did various pharmacies, but he was fine, maybe there was never any gap.
In the eighth or ninth grade, fellows, gypsies to the same year, other classes.
In short, they lost a teacher, often solved a police case there, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sometimes sell something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've always sold to the Cigans, the money they always had, didn't try to pull me at the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car, the guy in a month called that he had already rewritten it to himself.
I'm saying to myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (working, working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he pulls his hand, he builds apartments and houses, he's just having trouble around him, he's making trouble... he's kind of my color, but I'm gonna care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be here as well.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries, and despite the resuscitation care unfortunately suffered her injury at the site," Zuzana Fuitlová told the Law of the Speakers of the Yugoslav Health Rescuers.
Havarai probably blamed the driver who drove the girl.
Eighteen-year-old driver of Peugeot's vehicle probably drove in the direction of Zíchovec from the village of Bávorov and from undetected reasons he drove in the direction of the road.
After the crash, Škodo Octavia ended the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the car, described an accident by the Yugoslav police, Štěpanka Schwarz.
The young Peugat driver suffered a very serious injury.
It's a lot of damage and it's stuck in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-patient care, and in a stable condition, he was transported by plane to a Czech Buddhist hospital, found to be the rescuer of Faitlová.
She added that a man from the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide data
Lucas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's getting his pick-up cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, he has had a slight increase in the ordering of small orders, has to add VAT again and then transfer the data to the customs office.
He will receive an e-mail stating that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it shall be sufficient to fill in the data on the consignor, and if VAT has not included the trader at the time of sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount for the consignor and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide himself with a customs procedure, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll call one or two suspensions, insert two attachments, and I'll be ready.
For me, it's most of the question five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered cold.
Because of the new customs rules, he went down to the international post office in Prague on the day-to-day number of foreign attacks from 60 thousand to 15,000.
According to Czech mail, it is also a problem that people do not respond to the calls for the supply of data necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 attacks on international mail that we need to process.
If people were to fill out all the data they need, and if they were to fill it in time, so we would be almost here in half, the Czech postal speaker Matthew Vitík will say.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% inflation and expect further growth.
What should be done to slow this growth or compensate?
We need to see a reduction of VAT on food in Poland and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think will happen, what's inevitable with where it's going to go?
Prices are rising faster than payments, I believe it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who's the employee)?
I have been added 2% in the rough this year, which is a joke, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business that I do when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the demonstrative confessions of violent men are being sent to the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't take me how the court can only send a six-month-old animal behind the net just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And that doesn't mean that the victim of rape never has to remember.
Isn't this gonna do the potential future report of rape of the victims?
A man from the grave "puffed" his girlfriend from the Costumlat
A man from the tomb reluctantly helped the guards to secure his nationally sought friend from Kostomlat, on whom a warrant was issued to arrest.
He called them to him himself.
But he went for it with a turn.
First, he spoke up and made up his story that he was stolen.
After the call to the press line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stolen" told them that he had made up his mind to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officials on how to report to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a state-wide search, and they were ordered to arrest her.
That's why the case is going to solve the PRC.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slovenian?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnic or cultural, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with myself, it is a shame that Churchill has failed to ensure the release of Prague U.S. :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe anything without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I would not personally consider such a case of true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's a guess in the world if I don't, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god does a man choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in some of those thousands of religions there's at least one god who's been mistreating you, if you believe in another god.
Nevertheless, there is no God but Jehovah in the wilderness.
Would it not, then, be more rational to hold faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of those thousands of gods and the one true god I just didn't see, that I would be sent to hell or somewhere like that?
Other: Voluntary training with the following classification in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar to the shower.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All AČR files would be like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: There is a constant preference for cooperation between the education sector and industry, for companies hunting in schools and for some kind of propagation when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when we're growing up, but this process is going on all the time, each of us always learning something new, going from one area to another.
Similar proliferation should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that the Russian, German, or possibly Mongolian rider will never get out of here again.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something that's stuck in the rock, we have allies, and you'll defend us if it comes to the powder.
Well, you're welcome.
There is only one election in the United States that will crush their budget and the whole of NATO is going to die.
The English exchange us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish have once again shown that they have enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for a long time as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population that can control military technology of its own time.
And today he can pilot the far-controlled means of every teenager, so it wouldn't.
We don't need a border guard, it's bullshit today, but a saved teenager behind a remote control button will be able to handle it.
How to avoid falling into boxing sounds
You're gonna pack the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home wrapped in boxes and stuff?
These "waste" are again using e-shops that missing packaging materials.
That's why a map of the shops that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to deal with them as a one-way waste.
Any person may, upon agreement, bring to trading (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains 150) cartons, plastics or paper in full.
It supports small companies, reduces the amount of waste generated and also avoids overloaded blue containers.
Individual shops welcome packagings that are currently in the market of deficits and also saved money, as the packaging card has lost 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such trade is TIERRA VERDE, the producer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling material we have in Popovek at Brno are being carried by individuals who gather at home, and we are also invited by companies with whom we have agreed regular links to the deposited cartons.
We'll use it all when we pack a security deposit from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more thoughtful world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows, however, not only the pick-up places on the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to remove sorted waste from the household, where to deliver past medicines, tyres, earned electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, as well as reusable things will find their second home.
The entire project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“There are gradually gathering halls, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise otherwise become waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the company Clean the Czech Republic.
More than that, I feel bad that today's technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone playing games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem (mainly in English articles) arose that students in high schools do not understand the principle of computer content.
Because Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide this underlying file system with files and everything lies on one screen in the application.
It's easy to use the technology from childhood, but especially to learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented before the weekend the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over the hour during which he opened the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they would not be able to reach in half a year.
French politicians like it, but they like it and they like voters.
Macron's supportive break-in between the right and the left agree on a small, but just on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new choice of heads of state.
The election calendar also influenced priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately came up with the criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it's more of an effort to defend the history of it.
The country's right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmmour is now leaving France with the view that the regime of Vicha, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a magazine teacher seriously and let's not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of our versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs know who defeated him in what battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened office, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that returns to the massacre in September 1995 also gained appreciation for the regime and for the best actress, Jasnu Duricchi.
This year's Karlovary Festival was held at the first peaks of the wild lamb.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for Father's film.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit, and I'm not too shy.
It was cca like "to have the flu/to be touched" for a couple of days I had a break and didn't have the taste of smoking...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have a wig at the flu.
(Only personal experience, I'm not sure that's how everybody gets it.)
Christmas Book Types
The Christmas binary, which will expire on December 20th, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And they're going to go out with her, too.
We will add these books to this digital edition for you to arrange books as Christmas gifts, if necessary.
Prozac texts that link to the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Belllot.
Another portion of the world's observation and description of all things with all sorts of obscurity, depth and atmosphere.
In his second release, photographer Sixtak tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A report on the return to the roots, which will only be out of the question.
The Bohemian and comparator conveys the story of the Red Carcule into the sphere of the present village.
Its use of brutality overcomes the human version and fosters a horror of emotional emptiness.
And the fact that the way back to the instincts is shorter than a person's willingness to allow himself
The author in his last novel tells a rather less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who are left, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains start driving according to the new driving order, where the transporter changes
From Sunday they start driving trains on the railway according to the new rules of the road.
The biggest change is the exchange of transporters on some tracks, for example between the Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where the Czech Dragons place RegioJet.
Most lines only adjust the departure time, possibly slightly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on wheels.
With the sale of the truck, the transporters started in the winter.
The Czech routes plan to operate a daily average of 6783 passenger connections in a new driving order, from which they will be a daily average of 478 long trains.
The trains will be sailing in the new driving order, some 118 million miles [118 million km].
Roads along national connections under the new driving order will also take to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with a new driving order, sets up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will drive on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be transported to North Moravia or in western Czech Republic.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the prices of the freight since next year, and that is on average 3.2 percent.
The routes take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioItu driving order is the entry on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymbork – Kolín.
The carrier here, after success in the Ministry of Transport competition, will replace the Czech Routes.
Every day, RegioJet will make a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Further changes relate to remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Žjár nad Sázavo and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two back connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakov.
According to speaker Emil Sedlařek, the carrier also tried to maintain as much as possible the driving times of its remote trains as planned.
Without major changes, the operation of the Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier is also exchanged in some regional routes.
For example, the changes are waiting for passengers in the Českolipsk, where on the route from Mladé Boleslavi via Česko Líp to Rumburk will be the place of the Czech Dragons to drive the trains of Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use a single train for the second year.
Like the Czech Dragons, their price increases by 3.2 percent.
I don't have to agree.
Don't we learn the other side's view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were pushed and had to run, they died.
In my life, I haven't heard from the employer or from that time, nobody's defending this, just judging it.
No one will tell you at school that black people often sold to the blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought Indians, they'll just tell you everywhere how brutal we Europeans have killed each other, and they've killed each other long ago.
I spent some time in the United States, just in schools, in northern schools, and in southern schools.
I didn't think anyone would deliberately shut up, but I heard it was happening before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (perhaps there's a whole bunch of WW2 monsters in Japan).
My point was that history is not black and that we have a tendency to look at it today, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge things from that time on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those southern states, yes, the confederation train and famous employees are quite popular there, on the other hand, and they've had some good success, and I find it absurd to end them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people are idealizing it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves, and many things opposed them.
This is not what I would compare with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, they lie and manipulate, and there is no need for us to look at them (on YT there was also a video from the TV where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What came to me at the U.S. schools was the rise in Marxism and idealization of communism, something that had never experienced their land.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine these people will be a lot older once, I'm kind of sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because they're between the young and the ruling elite.
It seems to me that the need for feminism had long reached what he had, and it's not about the same, has been radicalized.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, are called, and it leads to radicalisation on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance and quite reasonable things.
And the more someone's more radical, the more they hear it.
Anyway, I also didn't see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with the wrong geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely inconceivable.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be a non-existence from the point of view of some personal identity.
If I'm so interested in people, looking at the world and sharing experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek pharithms here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
The Slovenian Pharaoh is a very nice guy, he's more about theology than politics, but then he's always screwing up some coronavir chicken that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, this is the Czech-Slovenian Hussian Church.
They're officially Protestants, but they're actually born from a Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to Husites worship because it's theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalistic temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise St. Michael's church in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 a.m. they make Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The plaza with Bethlehem is in Czech Republic, the rats took it from Austria
Brèclav — A plaza blessed in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
He was shot for a pandemy of coronavir, but this time he did not even go to Vienna, he was taken to the Rhinetal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning by his Austrian colleagues.
They took her to the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in each year, and I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, she told the current reporters, "Amalie Budíkova."
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right at the border bridge, now at the Rhinetal-Břeclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually for him, but he's driving a train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of the platinum after the Czech Republic.
With the Belgian light, they made their way across the traditional train to Brno, where it was handed over to the diocese bishop of Vojtěch Cyclle.
On Saturday, December 18th, the next distribution of light will take care of shoe riders who will travel by selected speeds and personal trains.
They will take the light from them in the local bulkheads or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flame to the Czech Republic and where the colleges do not.
Even this year, the skin must comply with the applicable measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both those courier teams and local action organizers to of course wear gloves, try to keep up with the breaks, they were at least not singing to colleagues, just to act so that it would be as safe as possible to describe the speakers' actions of the Belgian light Zuzana Hrbková.
The Belgian light tradition that travels to Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread together with the platinum of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
Bethlehem's light is for a believing symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In Czech Republic, shoes and shoes have been trying to spread them for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insanity and human interdependence.

I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that the grants are economic cancer, but I don't think the grants as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education makes good use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned, the product is produced by the rest of the world and is produced by the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where millions of students are "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" on walks, and such a company is simply artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives the job to people, this is the acceleration of development when this company keeps and takes orders/employees to companies that could grow and become more productive after its fall.
It's just a deal, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born online also gets caught up in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet ads don't move with me, but then I'm guessing they've affected me, too - it's just that it's already so far out of the way that it's always going to work.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a simple ban on programming (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban those internets.
I have a feeling of this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that most believe and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to say it's a critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TVs have dropped the trend of Christmas movies, their premieres this year have two hundred
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies and this year, it represents more than two hundred records to its viewers in the premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been pushing and significantly increasing public monitoring, so these images are growing more and more.
This year there were four more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so it will really be much more.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In Czech Republic there are associated with this period of history, in particular, worldwide there are also popular images at home, Love Heavenly or classical Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas pictures, but it started until in 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable TV station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventurous project called Countdown to Christmas (Computation to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station began its Christmas sightseeing on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and they also contribute to a total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
“In this magical period of history again, so much does not matter, it is important that there are many Christmas trees in the background and that they snow,” described this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book about Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll be home on Christmas movies).
“It’s a form of escape and a way of feeling a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the Christmas madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is even uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with you, but then it's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's probably going to work out, and you're gonna love each other.
That's how it's all around, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, it would not affect the final F1 race.
At the Grand Pricing Abu Kill in formula 1 only 19 riders will come out.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not affect the season until the final race.
That's how Haas will send just one form on the track.
In the final race, the season was to attack a better location from the 20th race that he graduated from.
Rus Nikita Mazepin from Haas states, however, will not affect the price of Abu Kill.
He was tested positively for covid-19.
On the starting floor, only 19 cars will appear, from the last corner will be on the trail of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who runs with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle.
Mazepin is said to be a Haas state relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because she was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, and security will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives stated for formula1.com.
He can't send a replacement driver to Ha's race, he can't.
The alternate would therefore have to complete the qualifications or rides in another part of the weekend.
There's no first racer with a man of the 19th.
At the beginning of the very end of the season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year were positively tested Sergio Pérez č Lewis Hamilton.
They can lock you up for this, too.
And everyone's gonna be stolen, the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, there is a man on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, sea, yellow or typhus.

Qíz: Why do corrupt companies often run women and what you never want to do after your leadership
Men's and women's wage inequality, the so-called gender pay gap, is one of the highest in the EU in the long term in Czech Republic.
What countries are the biggest differences?
And in what age category and in which sector do women make at least money against men?
Test what you know about the unequal remuneration.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive layer is huge!
It's a little like a portable mining and the creator put half a year's work into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but a little experience, we never had a lot of sweat at home," admits Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in the year.
Hedwab bought in Italy, 24-carat gold net in France, and 2000 delicious crystals were added by Swarovski.
The silver stars then gained 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a layer of hectolicity," the creator boasts his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it's got another hook.
"I'm on a mission, I've got to sell the sweater as fast as possible," Lebanon admits.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive butter, sold five years ago, became “only” 720 000 crowns.
If the MZ is distraught from reality, it's not too bad - it lets itself fly out of the evil circle and exchange it for a new one.
The fact is that the departure of the FB from Europe would be very helpful to her Norwegian part (this is under the influence of the hole).
I think it would clear a lot of the social climate.
It would also be better to explain the "World Brotherhood Assistance" channels to some of our political parties and representatives.
Then the people who love them would also have a clearer understanding of what they really care about.

In the United States, new cases of police violence occur, this time during the attacks in international protests.
The demonstrations that broke out after African American George Floyd killed policemen in arrest opened the debate on systematic racism, police work and cases of brutality against American minorities.

But what would increase the funding?
The Union will pay us money in grants.
If it stops doing that, we'll stop having the money.
I really don't see how the Union would stop giving us money because we're gonna use that money for something else...
You can claim that money from these grants could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned area.
Poland has formally requested the help of NATO, in relation to several months of the Belarus regime's actions, which in its territory calls on the citizens of the neighbouring countries with a false coercion of the easy crossing of the EU border.
In Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already active.
Mutation Omikron is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case of Adam's baby.
“We have currently reported further suspicions of this option in another child from Adamova, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the ZŠ Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the country during the week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Non-Crop Sources of the State Health Institute in Prague,” the director said.
She added that it is about two nurses from one workplace Faculty Hospital Brno and two children from one of them, two more eleven-year-old students from the U.S.A. Adamov.
There's no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four undetected periods.
No one with suspicion of Omikron abroad
None of these were foreign, nor any of their families, nor were any of those who lived abroad contacted.
The relationship with the champion in the water field is not one of those, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienic Paul Svrčinová stated earlier that the international tournament was being checked in the water field, which was in Brno several weeks ago.
On it were players from the Republic of South Africa, and one Belgian player got sick after returning.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas when he doesn't want to be kidnapped.
The Governor of California Gavin News announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism that was used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then have a claim for compensation for anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles in California and home-made firearms.
Newsoma's announcement responded to the Friday opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left a  Texas ban on abortion in force, as it goes against the old previous verdict of almost 50 years, which set the right to abortion in the whole of the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The ban was therefore transferred to the public in this case, which prevented the Texa Republican from attacking it by the ordinary judicial procedure.
"I was opposed to yesterday's (prudent) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the maintenance of a texa ban on most of the funeral services, and to a large extent supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives," News continues.
His subordinates believed that, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, they would work on measures that would justify the public representative to prevent the ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
This is the case in which domestically manufactured weapons that do not have serial numbers and which may be used for the maintenance of regulation are identified.
Newsom wants to have the right to claim at least $10 000 (through 220,000 CZK) and judicial expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell offensive rifles in California, parts of "arms of spirits" or plants for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, create a threat to private complaints, then we should do it exactly," the California governor said.
The AP submits that, after decades of banning the production and sale of certain weapons of the military style, California was banned by the Federal Court in June, but the ban was now blocked by the Federal Court as a counter-constitutional.
Since the State would now indeed renew its ban on the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court of Sonii Sotomayor, which in an inconsistent opinion warned against the extension of a legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant full immunity to a judicial review of the texaic ban and allowed the detention clinics to continue in appeals to the electorate of the southern state of the United States.
Each emergency waiting phase has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what will look like the vaccination scheme and also comes to improving the vaccine itself, based on results.
A study of the effects of 4 doses in Israel is already in progress.
And according to these studies, in most patients there are up to five-fold increases in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect.
Just like any other expectation will have after the time of its stunning scheme, it's just too soon to do it.
Another fact is that in the long run, a new vaccine should be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus that, according to the manufacturer, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.
We learn to leave the amount at ease.
But reassessing CO is learning.
Since Marie Terezie's time, our civilization and technology have made little progress and learning phone lists and describing the students in the sewers no longer makes a lot of sense and it's really waste of time.

How can I legally monitor the League of Masters online?
Don't you know if there's any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the League of Masters for a fee?
At home we have a Netbox and I'm paying a sports package for the Spanish and English football league.
However, this does not include the UEFA Masters League.
I think O2 is offering the League of Masters, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act in opposition to the law if it exercised new powers and stopped the payment of the money to Poland for the sake of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the recovery of EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of the covid-19 pandemic-affected economy.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to take EU grants to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to the EU's challenge on its own in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarí Polska, whose current government would be a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contribution to the EU.
It would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU is unlawfully disposing of funds from the common budget to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister has added.
Its party in access to the EU takes on a more radical position than the ruling party on Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has made to Ziobro's actions threaten its independence and undermine its independence to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, lays down "the impossible conditions because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "the political dictatorship of the era and seeks to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and Brusselsan bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join such a position in Brussels, which would restrict Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree with Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to get to know each other... there's one type of cheese in our Lidla in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt twice, I just needed cheese, parmazed, after ten minutes in milk rules, I signed up and I asked myself.
They had it, it's true, in this narrow sector, all of them were selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the green and the unlactose zone...
If it's out of the way, I don't even get into any market, the action, the gold temple in the square, they probably don't have that choice, but most of them have everything I need and they have some sort of order, so I have ten minutes of cash.
To Lidla to take my leave.
And I don't care.
I've been watching for two years, how it's supposed to be with the data as with the nose, most of the opponents of the waiting are just a little bit more out of the month than most of the waiting stops.
A rational discussion is taking place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions are received in public space.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binary thought: waiting will save us, waiting them for nothing.
To forbid everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparison of apples with bugs.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that the data collection methodology is different in those two states, nobody solves it.
Fuj, that's how I got into it.
I'm sorry about the trip and I wish you all a nice day.
In my childhood, I was served with a cook.
It was never because of the signs, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (read instead of going to sleep, washed with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I've never been tortured without warning, my mom always threatened me that if I do it again, I'll get the wound (of course even after another "stamping" just brought in and put it so I can see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
I think that this part of caution is important because it gives the child his way of choosing whether he will not listen and get, or whether he will improve or not.
In the end, I was only warned to start listening.
Protection of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 replied to the press question, what the Czech institution meant for him – if a solemn text which she has sworn and which she has refused to learn at school or, on the contrary, the agreement that may be changed if necessary, he definitely agreed to the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and the changes are better observed.
And imagine that some nations even enjoy their rules.
Just as the Czechs like puppies with pepper and celery, he voted ten times on the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing awareness among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to change.
The summer was tested by situations that its creators (who belonged to Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example, with the conduct of the directly elected president.
In one thing, but Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents shows that political intervention in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be a key to manage most of the crises that companies face in the face of history.
The Constitution is, inter alia, a rule of governance consisting of the individual rules that govern politicians to maintain the game.
We are afraid that a lot will be used against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to prohibitions.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to do their best.
Covid doesn't choose, in the United Nations Brno, they fight for the life of a few months-old baby
Although it is known that coronavirus is less common for children, there are also difficult cases with which hospitals are dealing mainly in recent times.
"We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said the University of Masaryk University of Petr Dominik, chief of the Children's Anesthesia and Resuscitation Clinic.
The course is much simpler, easier, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are with coronavir of the disease, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need a little support.
She's going back to the clinics of childhood infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir are up to the last time on ARU.
Children with post-cardiac syndromes were kept under the care of the doctor throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute cavities of pneumonia, which means a inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease involves both adults and a few months of a baby.
There are also children in hospitals in a difficult condition due to coronavir.
"At present, we have a child of several months and adolescents," the prime minister said.
It is, however, a pleasure that in the FN Brno child hospital, there have been no children's deaths on the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age were killed in the PRC on 6 December.
According to Dominik, a part of the co-operation of a psychologist is not only in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points to the fact that both adults and infants are reducing the course of the disease and at the same time lowering the incidence of post-covidal syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the occupational dose in children," the doctor added.
In a quiet area, you can only walk along the designated roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are seen on a tourist map on maps.cz.
You can walk anywhere in national parties outside the quiet zone (but not across the field).
Skiing/driving on a wheel in the woods outside the marked roads must not be allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not very careful outside the national park).
How's the conductor doing?
The music goes in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He's a retired liberal opera and he was originally playing on the forest corner.
As a singer he can sing practically every repertoire and as a conductor he acts not only in the liberal divadle F. Šaldy, but also in the Plzni, in the divadle Josef Kajetán Tyla.
It cooperates with urban philharmonic, film philharmonic, or with a sub-crustonic symphonic orchestra.
China builds awareness of the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Synologist Jirouš: China builds the perception of the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China's got into a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticizing him for not being able to stop the plague that has changed into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
States, including Czech Republic, are facing Chinese protection aid and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you get Peking's will?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend will meet a friend and say to him, "Don't you want an elephant all the time?
I got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car, she's playing with the kids.
Well, it's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Comrade: I'm gonna cry it, it's gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought them complains: "You guys, what did you sell for an elephant?"????
He's a sloppy lawn, he's got a shitload everywhere, he's got a car scattered, kids are fighting him, and his wife wants to get divorced.
What he says is that you're not talking about an elephant, so you're not selling an elephant...
The world's actions are controlled by great power.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can become so powerful only if it works for its integration.
It is still functioning at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there'll be different moods and it's going to happen.
I've been thinking about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on honesty, so maybe I'll talk.
I'm just saying that the ellipse most of the time includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins" when it is clear that it is both from Spain, where the mandarins of the Spanish fruit and mandarins are no longer clear from Spain.
In addition, I assume that the sentence sounds "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect it is already included in this broad concept and there is no further need to specify it in the American forces.
But again, I'm just talking :D
Whether it's like that or not, it's a stupid requirement.
In Tokyo there was an earthquake of five degrees.
Japan's Tokyo metropolis and the surrounding area hit the earthquake on Sunday by 5,0 degrees.
The Witnesses stated that buildings had been destroyed in the capital, but no damage had been reported.
There was no warning from the tsunami, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a cosman's monkey Milly
The fascinating pictures show the moment when the frightened monkey screamed in the washbasin before her insensitive owner slammed and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkeys also fed parks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's court in Gwent's life has now been banned by animals, reported by The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of monkeys who are taking care of Milly after her raids have declared that they have never seen such a frightened cosmonaut before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now he's playing with another saved monkey named Moon.
A four-year-old mother has confessed to two charges for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
In the Magistrate Court in Gwen, she was sentenced to twelve weeks of imprisonment with a conditional deferral for one year.
The Netherlands has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a life-long ban on animal welfare and has to pay 12 000 crowns of costs.
The leader of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly was long before she used to get used to people again.
She screamed and hid in front of anyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has sat down and is satisfied with the male, she can still look at new people.
The psychotic scars of tying will carry it on forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's trick came out of nowhere after the police in Gwen found out the horrible shots in a woman's phone after a raid in her apartment for drug charges.
On the footage, you can hear Milly snitching.
The next video is how the Dutch monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So give me the oil fingers.
In May, together with his partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to holding cocaine with a view to selling it.
In her home was found cocaine for 1,600 pounds (about 50 thousand crowns) hidden in children's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts do you learn from this tradition three times after you've been firmly leaping through the 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same stuff in the first grade?
And all of this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, most of all, does not care if you can or do understand it.
Especially write a test on 1 and then nobody cares.
Go on and on the street, people happen to ask whether to control the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone's gone through it, and the absolute majority aren't even wrong, and they're gonna tell you that they're all in a drink.
So, what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of general review and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment, it's unnecessary and you'll never get it to them anyway.
Part of it is taught for the many people who will need it.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff at the machine's, I was just serious because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point when we don't know what a punk sign is.
(In which we are likely to share our Communist past and fight against the students and elites) However, the price of being barbarians in these machines is just high.
If the reporters could count, this is probably where the man has never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," Andrea answered in an instagram in Stories on all sorts of questions of curious fans that disappointed her in Kadrim so that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrew, it's been stuck since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until he got back to the Czech Republic.
But she firmly rejected it.
And as you can see, not only did he not end love but he grew up in mutual hatred until he hated it.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Fascinating honesty of Kadri's ex-wife was no longer in love with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop the brother in public.
I don't normally talk about such things, and we've never said too much about these things in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But if I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and spin the name of someone I love so much, I just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most even when we were young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I wish everyone would know Kadri as well as me, our neighbors and family, standing in recognition in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know what it really was, added in uncertainty.
The drunk thief jumped the façade to the fifth floor.
You don't believe it for what.
Cchao started his career at the parking lot in the residential district, where he was trying to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally reduced the total of 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't think anything better than to jump to the 5th floor and enter the apartment open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On a security camera, he is then caught walking down the street from the scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
The next one was Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed the money, he decided to go for a walk in the spring.
The whole thing's been under investigation.
The Oppies spewed up the facade to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and activity bound to pandemic emergency.
If it's canceled, the law won't be effective.
The law limits the scope of the business
Is that not enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but not abolished.
In the Saturday elections, four municipalities came in over 60 percent of the voters
New representatives of the people elected on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradiščka, Lužice in Mosttecka, Nova Ves in Liberecka and in Ravné in Pelhrímovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of elected representatives has fallen here.
Of the total 28 candidates, 99 candidates were held on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest of 33.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to the general representatives and, above all, the very followed elections to the Ambassador, ČSÚ President Eva Krump, were held.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding for equipment and personal security.
In Komni, Uherskohradišk, the Saturday election of the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-year term of office.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the votes, which also means winning two mandates.
Two chairs were also received by the People for the Commune, giving them a vote of 18.52 percent.
Once again, they are represented by the current mayor of Jan Krzyžková, who is a member of the Privates.
On one mandate in the representative, Komňané – independent candidates were reached.
There were 75.48 percent of the eligible volunteers.
In the village of Ravná in Pelhřimovsk, the association for Ravná won.
50.50 per cent of the vote, which means four mandates of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2.
The election attendance was 93.62 per cent.
The repeated elections in Lužica in Mosttec have again won the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
A total of 56.73 per cent of the votes won and four mandates were held in the seven-year term of office in 2018.
The second finished the Community candidate for the people who voted 43.27 per cent of the vote, so three representatives will be represented.
A total of 76.7 percent of the volunteers came to the polls.
Elections in New All in Liberecka won independent candidates Hope for New Ves before the U.S. Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of the voters voted and thus obtained four seats in the seven-year general representation.
The UN received 40.12 per cent of the votes and against the right elections in 2018 strengthened, gained more mandate and has three.
The election attendance was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the election results will be held by the State Election Commission.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think you know all this stuff that people write here.
You're just playing stupid to have to guess who.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which finally was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in anything.
On the other hand, I wonder how much the church had so much in the Middle Ages, how much money it saved, how much science, and so on.
Don't talk about all the wars she's caused, like those threeties.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church don't have anything to do together
The man dropped his head down 12 meters.
The attack on concrete survived.
The incredulous fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, with the rescuers of the National Health Care Service.
National Operational Centre staff took over an hour after Saturday afternoon a push call with initial information about the fall of men from high altitudes.
Two ZZS - medical and health - crews went to the scene immediately.
Upon arriving at the place, the doctors found that a 17 - year - old man had to fall out of a window about 12 meters high and hit his head on concrete!
There's a coal catch in the Vittovy.
But not the way it should, and the fires went to the event.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and in direct danger of life.
The doctor intubated his breathing pathways, secured artificial pulmonary ventilation and, following other measures in the context of pre-patient care, transferred her medical vehicle to another care of the island traumatological centre, informed ZZS MS country spokesman Lukas Humpl.
I'm more concerned than with coronavir than with inadequate public and public response.
Dissemination of coronavir in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, in the first line of the fight against infection, but there are doctors and health personnel in particular.
How serious is their situation?
We're asking military doctor David Rezactor.

Legendary Nunesov fell after seven years, Olivera defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala night full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things were done.
Exterior Julianna Penň has been able to defeat the legendary champion of Amanda Nunes, who has not been able to find the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira, in a light bond, did not fail, presented to Dustin Poirier a great frying and acquiesced the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly broke Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
His opponent also defeated Sean O'Malley.
Surprise that no one's expected.
That's what brought the women's dance weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Penn.
The American entered the battle as a mental "trouble" but Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes has begun the journey after the victory very actively and the opponent even saved the push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, money did not cause any further flaws, and it failed to attack itself with a hand-held trap.
The second round was touching, and for MMA fans it was very tense.
Both rivals enjoyed a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got it on the ground where she started to scratch it.
That must've been trying to give up the attack.
That's how the American made a big shock when she became a new champion.
At the top of the gala, there was a battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier on the title in a light vase.
In the beginning, however, Poirier was better off, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he was trying to be more active in Olivera, who the rival tried to shake his hand.
It didn't happen too much to him, but then he created a big pressure, got a rival on his back, and fell asleep on a series of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked shock, which Poirier had a moment of excitement, but then he had to bend off.
The Brazilians so defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he subscribed to the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who in the first round planted Rauliana Paiv's true back.
Then he received a number of precisely measured strokes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to consult Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years of losing.
The bitch, or the bitch?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the basic names in the Czech language speak only one grammar family, so it is not a problem with them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle family.
Then there is also a relatively large number of basic names, with no family established.
Such essential names are intertwined between two poisons.
At the time of the landing, two concoves are present and, in some cases, remain in an unscrupulous form.
For example, the words “swiss” or “kissels” are a family of men and women, in which the first is based on the pattern “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “sing”.
For other groups of essential names, different forms are already in the first fall of the single number, i.e. "line/line", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambor" (in terms of food).
Both forms are then written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, in the Czech Republic and in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-written, similar to the other Czech-Mooravian twins are the words: "pomace" and "pomace", "pomace", "pomace" and "pomace" etc.
Some words that came into the Czech language from other languages were initially unscrupulous, but gradually they came to grips with the Czech connoisseurs.
A typical example is the term “image” which is a family of men and women, or the word “bufet”, which remained in the middle of the family, but in the male, it has the finals according to the pattern of “garden”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation appear directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to surrender to the southern border of Schengen after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid to the Czech government too.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to take the wrong path?
And how does the situation look right on the scene?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months, and we've been breathing, describing a reporter from Sydney.
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities there and the residents themselves balance with the threat?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic effects of the criticism?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in terms of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a reporter from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written all over the place.
It's hard for people to figure out what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so it's trying to talk about it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how they often treat people around them or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up to their traumas.
It's still a lot of people leave it to themselves.
Yes, they will find those who falsely accuse someone.
It's hunch and spit in the face with all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is meant" and that it's "trend" you only help sexual offenders.
Czech Republic Flooding well-equipped houses, families don't have money to finish
Building materials prices in recent weeks and months have increased by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people got into a state of light because of that.
However, it does not have the means to complete settled family homes, and the banks refuse to raise mortgages.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increased.
So people don't have enough money to finish a family house that's already set up.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best case, people move to isolated and unencumbered homes.
In the worst case houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent to that end," says BHS Economist Štěpán Kreeček.
We build two to three family homes in a year, and at the age of fifty percent, it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep some things confidential, even when the material is wasted.
So we do without a fee," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivený.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building of the house would go up to five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
Of the materials, the most demanding was the copper, iron, and also the installation and heating equipment.
Building companies, however, are also fighting a lack of workforce.
In Czech Republic, graduates of the construction sectors and the influx of foreign workers are failing to break the pandemic.
It is more favourable at this time only with regard to the issue of building permits.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček explained.
We're good and we'll get even better.
Real vision, but missing, says commentor ČRO – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, entry into the new year has already been traditionally held by politicians.
This year, with the exception of the Prime Minister and the president of the ANO Andrei Babiş and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the President of the Senate and Ambassadors.
What did we find out?
As in it comes to me a super diploma, I have my own theme that I chose, I apply to the bakery, I always do it all year round, and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The states are completely at peace with us if a man is not a complete duck and something is left in his head, then the commission will not repress him in theory.
I must have been studying at the statehouse for a week and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to point me to some logical drive that I liked right away and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do this semi-annual project to them (we did it many times, really beneficial, much learn) and then only learn the project and have grown old.
I think it's great when, at the end of the subject, there's a test to prove the knowledge acquired within the project, not just a defence.
All right, but don't count emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same freak as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can make a similar statue of Putin next to the bear's juices.
You should give her another way to shack up Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, though, that Insta throws the artists under her feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your accomplishments are reduced to a total minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether the bark, comment or storage.
I've had a lot of fun lately, so maybe I'm going to have to cut myself to the point where a lot of artists in my industry have success and don't let them.
Finally, I'd be happy if there's something user-friendly about the heat that doesn't take all the creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration by the Parties working on Donbase
Svasu – yes, destruction – no, they express their view on the image of the opposition to the destruction of the SSSR.
Thirty years from the illegal destruction of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the White Paper on 8 December 1991 Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, without any legal authority and breach of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open conjugal position of Michael S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed the agreement that “Svaz Svarz is an international entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
One slender pen "cut off" the huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
In the fall of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were displaced abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
And despite the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the past seventy years at one sitting in the White Forest betrayed a socialist camp (made up of the price of millions of lives in the second world war and in the Great Civil War).
They have, of course, de-industrialized, accelerated agriculture, removed from the world's largest power, fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked to the only mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the collapse of the economy, the sciences, the armies, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-World space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Jaracz, the war in Syria – all the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a notion in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been quickly hurt and given up has quickly been completed and achieved by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And today the whole world is shaken mainly by the events of the late 80s and early 1990s last century.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large installation does not have to correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which is 189 Kč / kg.
I'm going to buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it on Thursday night.
In the alternative reality in which I don't buy this meat on Monday, it will be sold to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - write me a mechanism that will make the change in its prices a pity for my survival system?
And either I'm waiting for Thursday and that meat will be dried 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 CZK and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer it myself. I'll do nothing.
These craps about being cheap, so it must be guaranteed bad, damaged or unquality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I've been to Brno to Hlavas, and in the basement, the lady gave me some brochures, similar things I always take to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of wild sense and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nothing about God anywhere, I was confused, but I thought it would be such an agittic.
After I read it, I found someone who issued it and finally came out of it.
Well, like he was a good old man, full of all the rest of the teaching, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a dick.
The damage to the paper, because of this, would not have forced them to clean up.
I've had something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychiatric manipulation and emotional exaggeration make you make this person speak out because you like him without knowing how much this situation is.
She threatened me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to see out.
Or even when I wanted to get out of her apartment, she broke up and asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then he ran for another half a year and started kicking her on the thumb.
Then I ended the relationship with her because I told her I was leaving and lying to her, but I could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some ammo again.
Such a person expresses your feelings, emotions, and total joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
If the insurance companies are stealing from this place by buying dark tests and hunting for positives that wouldn't be a test for that terrible disease, they didn't know.
The only thing we can achieve is the complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been in prison for five days.
In the West, they've already stopped with the witch, and they've recognized that there's no value in solving the disease worse than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new, and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by thinking of bubbling.
I see we're back with a good old shirt.
After a few years of altum and suppressing this dirty business, the MLM recruiting is back on dispatch.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a champion at the U.S.), the initial promise of training products and business skills quickly turned to "that you don't have to be interested, mostly getting people."
I was deeply interested in the products I offered, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and hurt people.
When the first made money came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to fry several certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable thing, so then people felt like an underground retailer.
What I can say, however, is that experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump at every point and carefully check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't have all of them thrown into one pit.
People in this business are successful and even successful, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or "good" account.
In a corporation where I'm doing a lot of things I didn't experience.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking at their management and they don't have much to do with us.
Regular evaluation is something that happens, in the form that this is going on with us quite well (set some goals for next year, let's see what went on and what didn't) - it's more self-assessment than someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
The company's actions are also optional.
But we're also a little bit out of business - there's a department that's more "corporative".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a short-startup that's squatting in the offices of the big corporation.
But it doesn't really bother us until the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days ago, the British police were looking for a missing 32-year-old Czech police who lost out at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradhska was dead.
Unfortunately, the British police have confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that she found the body of the wrong Czech citizens.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we will not be able to provide more information.
A sincere condolence, he put on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the 28th of November on her way from work, and she had to collect money from the ATM before her arrival.
Her disappearance was reported by workmates five days later.
Following her, the London police began patrolling her, and Interpol had her classified among the missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police in this regard have kept one man a few days ago.
What he had to play and what he suspected of, but didn't publish.
In the four municipalities, new representations were granted at the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, in the villages of Komňa, Uherskohradiščka, Lužice, Mosttecka, Nova Ves, Liberecka and Ravná, Pelhřimovska, new representatives were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of elected representatives has fallen here.
About 28 mandates were held in new elections by 99 valid candidates.
The vote amounted to 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Raven, where 93.62 % of the eligible votes were elected.
The mandate was totaled by 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new elections to the representatives of the four municipalities.
About 28 deputy posts were held by 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72 years.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
It has carried out four new or repeated elections to the general representatives and, above all, the very followed elections to the Post Office.
At the same time, we had to work mostly under more stringent epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal security, Eva Krump, the 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last round was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a long time to deal with the fact that we had a very dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without a lot of scratches.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its levels is going to be, I've got a problem with that so far.
I'm looking forward to it (morning) because I'm finally less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He'd be relieved of the President's office and the ability to recapture her.
It's a chance that it really comes to that, but it's like the others here mention very little.
Besides, I'm not sure if the pendant would even be considered a emperor.
The Council is an act that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased numbers of people up to 35 years of age who have no sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
It's mainly about religious-based people, it's the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of young people who claim to have sexual life rose from eight to 21 per cent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who said that she had no sexual intercourse in recent years is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the kronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute, which for young people make sex less and less priority.
"From 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who indicate that they had no sex in the previous year is growing rapidly," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% in 2021 stating that they have been sexless for the last year.
Stone added that marriage at the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Then, sexual activity also contributes to the fear of premarriage and religious foundation.
Although sexual activity is more likely for husbands than 35 years, the percentage of married and married children is still declining.
Young people share an opinion on premarital sex, and about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minority, but their behavior is changing this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, it is the reason for religious establishment.
Since 2008, free people under 35 years of age who attended religious meetings more than once a month have increased the rate of absence from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among the "less believers", the trend rose from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
The decline in sexual activity also contributes to other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly alcohol drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely to be with people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media that obviously reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, and this need is “encumbered”.
This trend was mainly behind the lockdown at the time of the kronavir pandemic.
The whole vaccination against covid is about whether the company should make part of the population to behave that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm personally interested in the question of social consciousness.
For example, if we don't do it to them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have killed an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, listened to some disinformation, and, as a result, didn't have to look at it and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a strong opposition of the expectation, which here on the side of the SPD and the KSCH is calling for something about the shaky and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unaccompanied pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do so on their own.
Czech without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up for a dry fight?
So far, this winter has brought one of the smallest snow spots in the Czech Republic for the last time.
Operators of ski resorts will not pass without technical snow, the weather complicates the need for the preparation of the Jizera Paediatric Paediatrics.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what's a little snow going to mean for the fight of drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once in high school, our teacher led us across the whole town on the boat so that we could get a project on the boats by the river.
On the way there we went once a fairly wide street and whom we probably don't see in the middle - the stairs of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course, they fell asleep on us.
I was lucky to run away, but with one of my friends, they went to the river.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what they were saying.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teachers, are laughing all the way to the ship.
We're awfully upset.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system is already playing, says Orosovich
The new German office of Olaf Scholz, following previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawieck welcomed her with military affection.
"We open a new chapter of mutual relations," said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the discussion.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly show that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is, according to the Office, to be dealt with by diplomatic negotiations, and also by "Normandian groups", which unite France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the office about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexandr Lukashenko has been able to trigger a migration crisis and uses people as a live target and weapon, because we record a hundred attempts every night to cross borders (unlawful) across borders.
He talked to the office about further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to prevent the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and has condemned the non-Kingdom treatment of Lukashenko's regime with runners.
The drunk Polish mirror caused an accident, trying to keep it hidden
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driving another jeep who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still get a driver's license for not taking advantage of the ride and getting caught from the crash site, she came out with the truth, introduced the TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had found another leptic who asked her for help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestine.
She was bitten by breath tests, and after they found out that she had two mistakes in her blood, she was immediately given a driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be heard by the court of her own actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
He's chasing Shaymovic, but he didn't hurt his movie.
The Czech family comedies have seen themselves in American fairy tales.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film novel.
After the film F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, now there's another video in the movies here we watch.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Shajmovič ml. is free to attack on his previous film Here I've been watching since 2012.
On the scene, the talking asshole Hugo is coming back and some famous figures around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension, who's comin', and so they're gonna start calling him a dog, Julie's father with a partner and her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, but she's a teenage girl who's been living her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Shajmovič (which is also the producer of the film) have been dealing with reporting procedures already in the previous song, but there were at least children and dogs.
This time, the two of us wrote an even weaker scenario that causes a mixture of awe and feelings of shame.
Let's cut it down.
Julie, as a scientist, is in mourning for the child's dark delusions and when the correct "constellation" comes together with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the co-ordinator precisely determines – on the car or church tower (even during a journey with a local guide), the distinguished Colonel Mojmír, despite his summer training, is shot in the forest of his own daughter (Julia), who falls into the coma, which is the family's hospital taken to the heart of the forest unit to play a miracle healing process for dogs.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, was anxious about what a human being had to do with the whole of the incredible situation and the figure was needed for this message.
Two staff thief, dog competition, forest charlatan, police officers coming to the scene to look for "drugs" and discussing the herbs of the nasty strength of bone marrow – and which a family in retirement is obviously drunk.
When a hero is examined after a difficult coma, and a reindeer is placed on the ground and dressed with a cigarette at the family table and the father’s whisky and hair is required to cure the vegetarian cannot be denied.
The proposal by the viewers will explain that "sometimes it happens after the comet".
Sheimovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of text work, the ability to build a nose situation, a sense of character and point and direction.
Heretic performances are unbalanced, the roofless, and the overall impressions are punctuated.
Whatever Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to stop their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only piece of film remains the poetic images of the forest cameraman Vladimir Holomka and two of the miners.
It is not enough to plan a number of positions, a chattel puzzle, and a dog’s songs, so the more human vulgar expressions that the figures allow.
The argument is not even a summer membership of the Horsemen's Club - as in the case of the producers.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a person with a dog must also be the knowledge of the novel if a person wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
There's a little bit of eroticity and a minimum sense of gender for a good family picture.
Even as an ad in cancer therapy, this amateur-acquired piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant inputs from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and pushing, here's how you fucking understand that, but that's just because you never tried.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you were to listen to a thief like that, you might change your mind.
It's a job like everyone else, in which case a brigade for an assignment.
The nearby exit is usually dry for months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
"The complete absence of hits during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Weather Service confirms.
For example, in northern Israel, the village of Kfar Giladi reports only six percent of the long - term average.
That's why the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been here long.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the people of Nazareth were pleased with your Askar.
The strikes in Israel come almost exclusively in the winter months, are offensive and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them, they ask and are prone to fires.
It's not only about forests, it's also about drinking water resources, and it's about farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, this year in the spring, thanks to the last three rainy winters, it filled the area.
Since then, the cold has been falling.
The water managers warned of the drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a shock here," the Israeli Water Agency spokesperson Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help with technologies such as waste water disposal or recycling.
The worst are the economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tankers.
Water and private wells are dry.
"This year I received orders of seventy-eight percent compared to two years ago," said Imád Sulejman, tanker driver in September.
In Iran, strikes between farmers and security forces broke out in Isfahan.
The protests made it dry.
The corals of the local river felt completely waterless.
The region has the most dry November in many recent years.
Israel prepares a military attack against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the Vienna talks did not bring "no progress" and that Washington informed about the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "can understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I'm gonna have a little puke and a little barbecue during the interview to find out what she really wants me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these substations, so I've been having some doubts and questions for a while, and I finally thanked and left.
Tell me I'm in danger, but the pyramid is pyramid and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers of the weekend went out to the mountain, waiting for snow and good weather.
The Czech mountain centre experienced this weekend's first major effort of skiers.
After an efficient snowing at the end of the week, it is not a snowstorm, and some skiers started operating.
The stewards have not committed an obligation to prove themselves in the absence of a covid certificate.
While not complaining about customer interest, some ski equipment loans report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
In the racetracks and in the resorts, thousands of people in the Liberian country said about the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the weather that today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We're calm, this opening weekend really came out of the Friday evening skiing when we had on the hill of the first skier," said the director of the Sports Area Ješted Jakub Hanush.
Hundreds of people expressed their appreciation for the first weekend skiing in the new season as well as for the Jesuits.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the centre of Branné in Schumpersk had been opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, and on Saturday, 400 people were expected to leave.
The conditions are strict.
Today the sun shone, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, it did not run the praise of the representative of the ski resort at Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can sell ships only to people who are infected or who are in the period after the disease has been diagnosed with covid-19.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared and proof of the necessary documents, CZK René Hrones from the ski center of Špindler's Mlýn said.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some of the rentals and sales of ski equipment.
I'm looking forward to the loan.
It's not like last year, but it's still a lot of customers, Alexandra Bokišová from the obava store of Skiopava.
Greater effort is expected during ski courses.
Also, the manager of Snowbear David Shintak's royal building company feels that it is not about borrowing ski equipment as much as it used to be.
We were almost disbursed this time before the pandemic.
On the contrary, the period before the pandemic was about 50 percent, the CHK said Shinták.
According to him, people with pandemics were lazy and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the large demand is recorded by a loan in Novako’s area on God’s Daru.
They started there a week ago, and the interested party already has to order them in advance.
"We're starting to borrow this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Novakova area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want success and wealth not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There's smart people and slick people who don't have any property in the country.
The owner of a foreign company is not going to leave.
I agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they just don't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began to win Orbán one beautiful day, the year ruled and, at once, the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic can't be moved from day to day in a similar position.
The next question is no choice.
If he's living here, he can win some traditional V4 nut.
Young people and education will be left behind, their supporters and people whose property is not allowed to land on the plane.
It's a beautiful picture!
Longmayer in the blood because of a beer beet?
While in the Czech Republic there was a full stream of autumn, in Thailand, the film team in front of Jiří Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
Herec, on social networks, published a blood picture of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a film show?
The London police are still searching for the unrecognised Czechs.
She was last watched on her way home.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor in a Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srcová worked.
“ Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her, and she wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her missing Czech on Sunday 28th November around 19:45 she left work and headed home to the quarter of Camberwell.
Last time she was allegedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, she acted as "health nurse assistant" in the Children's Hospital Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is under the hospital's Guy's and St Thomas' Association.
"We are anxious about our dear colleague Petru, who is not famous," a group of health devices said in a twitter contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her to contact the police," the message continued.
The public also calls on MP Harriet Harman, who pointed out the case of Srcvo at the press conference on Saturday.
"It's been a few days, it's only 32 years, it's from the Czech Republic, its parents are of course to the death of the establishment," laborist politician said, holding the woman's photograph in her hand distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was outside her home country, leaving the family and working here for our health," Herman said.
The police had previously held a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC's reporting website, however, the police did not provide any information on his identity, nor on what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine like that, either.
It's not a huge amount, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine constantly repeats that we increase the threat of the Invasion and begins to have our entrance full teeth.
I've been quoting up.
I don't know what you decided the Russian war was about.
The war is a hell of a joke and Russia has HDP Italy.
Comparison with the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the first Hungarian war and the "annex" sycilia :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia is investigating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would do.
Ono, I'm a servant of the covenant...
In Prague, new traffic rules have been applied since Sunday, mainly for urban connections.
The passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting from Sunday for a number of changes concerning, in particular, urban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
In an integrated system, Mladoboleslavska is again involved.
In the main city from Sunday they stop fast from the Czech Budjejovic in the Zagradně City Station.
In urban train transport, S7 trains will be driven on the route from Beron to the Czech Brod to Prague main station.
In the recently run Praha-Zagradně město station, a fast R17 from the Czech Budjejovic and Benešova will stop again.
The PID is being re-extended to other areas.
In addition, buses will go to the World of Sázavo, Blatna near Jesenice, the Old Splavas and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslavska, including lines with overpass to Libereck and Královéhradeck.
77 lines will be removed for integration, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation will be adjusted on 12 staff.
From Prague, Zlicín will take out a new bus line 405, which will go to Jaatce.
There was also a new direct connection to Prague – Kralovice to Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be sent in the morning of the peak and in the weekend the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the 404 express line will be released again.
New ones are included in the PID system lines 400 and 410 driving to the Libereck country.
They're leaving the Střížkov Metro Station, not the Holesovic Station.
The parent line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected links continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonno in Podjšděd.
On the other hand, new operations on dozens of medieval local routes, including Mochova, Dobříše or Rozmetal under the Trimišen, have been abolished or restricted.
All trains with departure from Prague were cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, long-term restrictions on the routes of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Lab and around Kolina continue.
The changes are also waiting for the traveler in other places.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the line 420 from Dobříše with a Prague drive, where it is possible to use PID to Milevska.
The changes have been made between 540 and 543 routes in Nymborska and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Czech Republic and Horovicka in the Plzeńsk region are adjusted.
Sanitary snacks/dining in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-min break and my only option, where to get food, is to go next to Billy or a bit further to Lidla.
Since I don't have any movement, after work, I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat the most healthy and diety.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll quickly buy a maximum pizza on the ground and in the juice of yogurt and apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat adjustment would you recommend me buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If it fails, the tree may be more prone to hip disease.
I don't think that's the only reason they're not keeping us out of the driveway, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession of the relationship with the Negro: I didn't even enjoy this.
The Czech showbyznysian fisher since Friday is nothing but the discovery of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Paul Neved.
They've been pulling it together for years, and the famous footballer even let himself get divorced because of the singer.
She now sends a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why love is a long half secret before them.
"I allow myself to say that there is no one currently in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would avoid that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Needda," he jokes Dara Rollins, who is in the most successful Czech football player in love with her ears.
I think he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are a center of attention, and although they are in the public interest, they have no joy.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew that this one time, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse at it.
If those who don't even care about it and jump it out of the can, or we're the ones whose lives are under discussion.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were quite fit, or you were insisting that everyone really know the list of your former partners and were aware of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a joke, you want it, okay, Darry.
Two of them got together in Italy, where Rollins drove for the preparation of his new fashion collection.
There's a long time left to be the Vice President of the Juventus Football Club.
The truth is, they went out to this point because they were waiting for the end of the ignorant divorce.
Ivan's wife and I have been separated for three years, but they're not theirs for just three weeks.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and who want to, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have a heart in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and just like him, I'm standing with him.
Hi, the other commentators are probably saying everything that's important, I'm just confirming that the wheels are great at the beginning, my colleagues mostly met during the first semester or two, and they came to work, and then we found ourselves together, which is my best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The flats don't intrude too long ahead, so now you probably won't find too much, but looking at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, avoid not only Ceylu, but also around (the streets such as Vranovska, French etc., it's a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit of a ghetto.
On the contrary, Veveří district is very student, the King's field and this way it's nice, but it's close to most of the VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never been hired, but I'm a Brňák family, so if I can talk to Brn as if you're still missing some information :)
But that's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what has been decided to do with several doctors who are in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not finance enough some schools.
Either he learns what he wants and he pays for it out of his own mind or he goes according to the state and he pays the state.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control the part of education simply because a few crowns will be added to the necessary state contribution and will thus be able to teach in schools what he wants.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in writing it to a person who had said two days earlier that way about a petition for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against it if anyone goes to the funeral is the same for you as the vote against it to get some socha to be in the square?
I'd like to consult you directly with the man who gave you this job.
Otherwise, I've already found that (and for a long time professional) it's kind of coming from the eye, or I'm writing something like xxx *** or ... (under the convention) and in the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd be able to deal with it in some way in the note that you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign database and find the nearest one here.
But because it looks like you're dropping out of a book, I'd guess that the author or the printer simply created his own sign, which is sitting on what's physical on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more a chance of a rising kingdom than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone's already broke up with you.

Politicians don't even know what will be the theme of our presidency.
It's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they'd approve of something because no one understood any text is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined by the word, and at the same time some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is the matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters are working, English is more suitable for informal contacts, the binding of overstandard relationships.
In addition, with English, this is quite interesting, after the EU's GB.
I don't understand that hat on Ceyl.
I've been working there for the third year and totally fine.
How many times do I drive from work I at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who almost broke up in life.
Yeah, there's probably a majority of the Roma population in Brno, but the only thing they're doing is they're gonna stop on the beach and park where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out there on the street tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go quietly.
A lot of apartments are now renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dad and my dear Gelem as a bullet in the flesh!
Who's spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the Advent Prison burned their first candle, Felix Slováček didn't.
I don't have an Advent Family, so there was nothing to burn.
I saw the gifts of the wedding, and Lucie must have had some, said the bright saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
He's visiting, but he's not staying in their house at the Vinohradech, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
She still doesn't know where she's going to be on Friday night.
We just met with Annick, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovakia and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen on Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying presents all the time and I'm sure I'll buy something, like a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the cross of the music video club Richman.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to talk to, says the Slovak, who was happy to meet his wife, Human Saturday Adrian, or the singer, Kamil Nivlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to stop this territory.
And I don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that might be in a hospital crisis.
The police are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else is the high percentage of trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to stop Ostrava just goes to the head of the previous government, not the army, that's asking for a new toy for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural aid, the landscape should not be just a factory for food, says the newspaper.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters were in the mountainous and sub - mountains, and the smaller peaks are also noted where the need for moisture has not yet been.
The reason for the drought in most of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we own land.
What are you prepared to do in connection with the dry?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be like, I'm barely gonna stick around in the ice piers, and maybe I know what to do with hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hall.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russia Bear" or "Lama China" you'll lose by two balls, even though you don't have to win a match at all costs, they're different than when they're compared.
But just like I'm listening to Czech commentators who smoke, what decision makers don't notice whether it's a male or a female hockey game, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And theirs if it was the opposite, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they won, it's probably the classic "they've lost" vs. "MY we've won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The cases confirmed in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic of 1967 for 100 000, 871 for 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million Sunday.
In the last 24 hours 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since 13 October.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces a "inevitable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on Dr. Susan Hopkins' television, the main medical advice for the British Health Security Office.
There will be a need for new quarantine measures.
People infected with micron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died on omicron, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after the accident and about three weeks after the accident.
The chief of the British laborers, Keir Starmer, found on Sunday that Boris Johnson was apparently violating the law by having been introduced in December, when a holiday party was banned, arranged at Downing Street the Christmas Eve.
One of Johnson's government's ministers suggested that the Quebec was "virtual" through the computer.
However, he was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers at Downing Street.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
During last December, when a tight lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers arranged a fair wedding despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today, two years ago Boris Johnson won the jury in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the prime minister's office.
It's remarkable how fast the events have developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits the spring of elections that can end the 12th anniversary of the government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a choice of European importance.
How can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His side Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral circles to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can choose where they want in practice.
This will allow Fides to tie the voters from the determined circles to those where the result is inexistable and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
It's a very different situation.
Earlier it was not if Fides won, but how much and if he's going to have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get united opposition.
It's for Victor Orbán and his party a big accident.
Won't they be able to keep playing even harder?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
She recently fled to independent media by recording the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where the heads of secret services declare that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news.
It all starts in the language.
I was beat quite often, last time in 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither did I, her dad has a long time, but then she screams extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric, and I grew up like a little scary, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cricket and was all blue, it took me about 2x to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I certainly now have the tendency to deal with things with violence, as a little bit of a wash, now to get rid of at least something, and as a younger parent I need to cry so much over the arm (so I don't get too much over the hold), so I don't have anything extreme, but I always have the pressure.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my exuberance, but I'm sure that education has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think beating children is just bad and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it wasn't "discovery," but from frustration, on the other hand, if every parent just fucks something, maybe it's not possible for their children to break up at least a little, so I don't count it on them.
It doesn't bother me at all, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
So I would call the kundami those who make laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you'd mind not having a chance of income?
Can you really count on people to want and buy a product and you'll have what mortgage to pay for?
The cat's obscurity world.
Where does Slovakia move the process with the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main character begins in the process with a quarter accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She was a civil society, but she also discovered the practices of the defendant, Marián Kočner, and his connection to the points of Slovenian politics and justice.
How is the main breach going to mean the process for Slovakia?
This is a huge deal for reporters.
How is it possible that this petition had more regular media attention than the anti-peaks of all medical colleges that came out of the day, two later?
But they let themselves get together and the company gave it up.
On Czech television, she died with a man a year and a half ago.
The next government will end and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the choice of warehouses
Mr Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be recast in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše is at the end and the law that should ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of the deep storage of highly radioactive wastes still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the negotiation of a proposal that the government submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after the flight.
Its content, however, is in serious conflict not only with the countries concerned in the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also with the Holy City and the municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments are expected to strengthen their capacity to decide on the stockpiles promised to the elderly since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its proposal for a coalition agreement, to work together with other countries.
The proposal for a law by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, includes the municipality in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of a place for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be effective if the locality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at the given location at all.
This may be ensured by the deposit of the obligation of the depositary to apply for the consent of the municipalities concerned before the entry into force of the specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a matter of interest almost completely ignores public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipality practically only statistics in the course of the procurement procedures.
In the proposal, there is a lack of system setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of searching and selecting sites for storage, authorisation and operation.
The local representatives actually do not have too much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a place to store.
Only in certain licensing procedures may they make their comments or withdraw, however, the authority or minister in whose interest they are authorised to issue them shall decide.
Any appeal shall not have a suspensory effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in the approval of the warehouse, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition to another failure of the government, which rents an external legal office for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which has been concluded by SURAO and which relates to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánk.
According to the contract register, the total amount for this work is about 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknikka, mayor of Ceyle from the locality of Crádek and speaker Platforms against the deep warehouse, said: After the ministers of industry, who set up self-government with the state authorities in search of a deep warehouse of highly radioactive wastes, we are just looking for a more significant turnout from the new government.
We offer that and a hand of help.
We also thank the Council of cities and villages for supporting the problem of the lack of rights of the municipalities in such basic buildings as those directly affected by the localities.
The Platform against the Deep Storage shall be composed of 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 communities) with a view to proposing a change in the State's approach to the loading of fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be limited to the deep storage site.
The Platform further recommends that the decision on the selection of the storage site should be subject to prior consent from the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) contributed to the loss of fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change for many years in his life, his doctors finally scared him.
They told him if he didn't forget, he'd die.
And that's what it took.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
His new position was praised in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There's a different person from Roseanne's fathead!
John was glad to be mocked by friends and family asking him to get lost because his big body caused his furniture to crack.
"I've lost everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in a conversation for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, said for ABC Goodman, whose change is amazing.
It also matters what boss and what you want to use the word "boss."
If it was some text on the platform that's expecting a player from the game environment, I wouldn't change it at all.
If it was a formal text and a high school text, I'd probably be looking for a better description or explanation.
There are more kinds of bosses for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses that yeah, and so "boss" is something like a master / ruler given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hiding bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) who don't even need to beat to complete the game or level, but often they are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't run with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're called anyway?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It literally translates somehow the boss just doesn't work, the Czech and the other languages don't solve it somehow. (I wonder if it's just Catalan that the boss translates as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game generally significant, computer-controlled opponent stronger than all previous and monitoring the completion of some level or task.

Pre-Night Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the coming year’s end of the attack significantly increased.

In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured more global campaigns.

Formbook contained the most common annex with the .exe extension, bearing the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account continues to appear.
The Annex in Czech may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
The significant decline and decreases in activity show security analysts in the Fareit programme, which stood at 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic for the last few months had no greater attack campaign.
Today's a democracy of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated assholes.
The reason for Prague was bigger than the media.
According to the drawings of the coast and my experience of the demonstrator, I don't want to dismiss about 10,000 people.

That means that people really are a lot.

It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction might take, not only on the movement of money, but also on whether a triple Pfizer vaccine will not be four and more doses.
It's definitely not going to be left-handed or middle-handed, so bet.
The triple vaccine is almost sure to become a multiplicity, because it's obvious that we're going to have to let go of each and every half year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant actions of scientists who are proud of human rights.
