No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish those paragraphs, on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
The new regime, which could have led to the release of the prisoner's minister of expertise, refused to accept the second reading of the application for the relief of the fines for economic delicacy.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October due to the conclusion of a allegedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, and the appeal of the defendants to the court will be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko himself referred to the judgment as a political enemy of the regime, and even in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the pre-accession of the Court.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of State was convicted of removing from the criminal code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for his adoption.
Libyan Dinar
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the election of Islamists, the question is only what - the moderate or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council was known as the customary law of the Shariğa, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without criminality, because for theft it is a short time the hand is cut off.
Women should also forget to think of emancipation as quickly as possible, to be guided by possible faith distortions, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united from each other's voices in the future by the Koran.
In the short term, in Libya, an order will prevail which would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, would be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objectively seen, perhaps not the best, and it would hardly fit the differences mentioned by the Libyans.
It is rather frightening to see the Muslim fighters being helped by the faithless dogs at all.
It may be only for her to apologize that NATO's air raids were not directed by any general from America, but by God himself, whose power was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libya, the west is not one of them.
We took part only in a change of mind, served the interests of Islam and our politicians to settle in the person of the dictator of a political alliance, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a military occupation in Libya.
As a result, the hystericals are concerned - that is, the distribution of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without an occupation?
Well, the West can finally boast of the right of its independence in matters of protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharai-a representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market is racing all records.
The investors not only keep Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in view.
The statistical offices of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, which from France grew by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany was expected to grow higher than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France had a slight decline by 0.1% (original data only referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
In comparison with the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend in growth slowing economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overestimated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the entire euro area and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy collapsed by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year-old government bonds reached the value of 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish state bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to experience problems...
The rate of return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes will be cast, the ECB will be the last believer.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well placed Torwart Czech and a wonderful tower by Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will again not fail at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the game up in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half time and a giant export luck in the second.
The Czech selection was also successful thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro very happy 1:0 and has therefore released her ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they only put the Montenegrins under pressure in the second half.
The peach birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant odds.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Czech, the Czech election will be accompanied next year by the European championships, and it is also pleased that the national football team will win a prize of about 200 million.
From the first minute on, it was played quite combat football.
Both teams were long-term combined, and so was played mainly around the centre line.
Also in the second half of the year, the pressure of the home team remained, and the extensive executions in front of the persecution were successfully rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core programme.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear programme against a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran made a living shield around the core technology centre in Isfahan, which is processed in uranium on Tuesday.
So they wanted to know that they were ready to protect their country's core programme, even if it was necessary to protect them with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has not given up all of its efforts to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed in the middle of the afternoon before entering the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out in the plan to put the Iranian nuclear programme largely weak, the Israeli press would, according to the Isfahan centre, also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The food map of a fat child: It does not freeze and eats for breakfast
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys show - adipic children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again it shows how important it is for a healthy person to develop the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
Adipic children are up to half the time on the table, more often than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the morning of the lighting action under the motto "Adipositionas is not a coincidence" of apples for the evening break.
In families with dickers, sport is not just about favorite jobs, but also about the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents are at least once a week for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year against the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being questioned throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second anniversary of the action "Adipositionas is not a coincidence", supported by the General Hospital and the Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and a lack of movement within the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, half of the children surveyed started eating, five times a day, in the mode breakfast-two breakfast lunch dinner dinner - one of the main prerequisites for healthy nutrition," one of the survey results says.
No breakfast and cheese for the evening break
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as regular family breakfast, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of the students are enjoying breakfast.
And - in most families everyone enjoys for themselves.
The worst was the finding that is not frozen at all in every ten families.
The breakfast is considered as the foundation of healthy daily food.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children much more common unhealthy apples are consumed.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the surveyed children play sports, only less than half of their parents do - that is only 15 percent.
Merge your personal menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet plan from offered options according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in food points is far from the ideal of healthy food.
Among their favorite foods were many melons, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming in particular," the final report stresses this survey.
In the afternoon, that is, at the main court, tenig goods were almost in front of birds.
The children almost didn't like chicken fruit, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Back to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"In many cases, a clear shift of the preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition was shown in the results of the project in the survey group, which completed the questionnaires after the concluding of the explanatory lecture "Adipositionas is not an accident".
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more frequent birds or fish as the main judge of the day and were willing to eat less knots or sweet foods.
Profis claim - a stylists must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit of a softness that was a bit too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't realize what was going on.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how it "is on the spot".
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer we get to the test, the more information and practical tasks we are facing.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time we debated with Director Alena (on the course no one takes part) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportional figure.
And they're the most of us anyway.
They have one too short neck, the other one too young with no normal curves and the others are soft again.
It is the thing of the stylisticist to cast wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to exhale the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to draw a woman's type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, wide hips and narrow waists - nice and figure bet, without acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the rock or toe really does not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
You won't regret it, because good sitting clothes is simply unpayable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in one of the stanzas that are always too high and disassembled, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can also be allowed to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, stickers or scraping.
With this lot of information and figure types, I'm glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to create it in the light of the homework set up.
Each of the participants was awarded a prom for which they should think of suitable outfits - day clothing and abendrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the style of the appropriate star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to "draw up" Miranda Kerr, who may know you from Victoria's secret campaign.
I'm happy inside, because it's a lot better for me personally than for Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent years (after all, this is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search, print and then graphically edit them on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylelist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also forms the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific default, for example trend handbags, mäntel, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overview.
The information on types of figures has been rejected by three visitors from the sector:
by Stylish Jan Pokorný, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat like usual over the Jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear it, and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to raise the sleeve or the collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with that," he stressed.
Mostly, however, I found the following advice: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"First, you may hurt her," said Jacob.
Finally, I find out why we have to break all these lessons, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often get to see everything else in fashion journals.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this in the design of the outfit.
That the image and style were made half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorny.
There is only one need for Madonna to see a not just brilliant singer, made from the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known individuals often hold this for discarded money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look twice).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect him or her to force a whole other size (smaller) than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to gloat to make sure that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has re-orientated, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylists just focus on fashion and then the outfit needs to be "combined".
In his work he must communicate with the people he stylises and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Estimates people without offering themselves and standing up for their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look for their wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't empty the entire closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few of the things that you recommend what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what such a so-called "platchet" must include.
So there's a bag that you attach to the waist and where you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scars, hair removal rollers or safety needles, they also contain tools such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is torn back if it is too large (sticks or other glues are forbidden so that the fabric is not cut) and of course nutrient.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to wear shoes properly.
Also when photographing at the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe solstice, bend the outside.
We would stick and we would stick...
With the scar, you can't even touch the shoes so you won't hurt them.
So you really need to go ahead.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This skill is not just my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we got at the second weekend follow-up course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to devote yourself to the styling on a professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race around America
Review
The original care-free journey is made by a series of completely preventable, dilettant mistakes to the routine journey to the breakfast.
Although it has succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what benefits it already if obviously no one liked to do a little more.
Before he came to the shop, the new part with the sub-title "The Run" raised high expectations.
However, he promised that the already-enhanced game series "Need for Speed" would once again move a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not actually appear to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the fit passes, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and goes on foot.
But the way you're used to NFS is in the end effect is a lot different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is painted by some surplus errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there's actually no error anymore, but rather signs of an incomprehensible failure of the game developers in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main figure is Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the highway - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be run on a different course and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently diverse and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to think that the game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics does not go beyond the previous parts of the series.
So there's no world movement.
But the journey through the desert, through eastern landscape or high above through deep-cut landscape seems very pleasant.
Incidental elements bring a slight variation in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly restricts the view.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be protected by a maze.
In addition, the individual races are well built together.
Just a few, but they're rich.
For a while you try to take over the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are trying to mix up with.
A novelty is passports in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack runs in front of someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (especially only three).
Finally, this thing is more beneficial because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it is part of the context of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The vehicle model runs in the feet of the previous parts.
That means, from the point of view of today, it does not grow trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
Whoever's looking for realistic simulations has to take care of himself.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well-equipped, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems arise only after some time.
Unlike the vehicle model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind it is unlikely that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you don't have an idea about how the car behaves, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: In the case of close overcrowding or avant-gardeing on the opposite cars, you "drive" in some places the other cars are easy, in others, but you get close to the same situation and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car goes straight to the junk.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, it's all bad.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back to the last point of beginning of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, it's all going to go away.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't be left behind.
Sometimes, however, it does not even help restarting, as nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
It is unacceptable that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be run in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not pass through.
Otherwise, you will meet at the appropriate place "civil" cars always in the same configuration, whether you come as first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly painful in situations when you see that the opponent passes before a player on two opposing cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to move them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The contractors still have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where one is always taken over at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
This is the craziest thing to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The opponent must have one here apparently come out on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then he'll naturally take a look, so you'll start driving your own car a few times in Klup.
Clear - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this purpose is so clear that it loses a quick joy in the game.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler model of driving, the game is all quite entertaining and apparently also so loaded action that you almost don't know where one's head is anymore.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what it's "in debt" - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't happen for a long time, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the race.
You can't ignore the tanks on the road, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super-sport cars for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentines in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task mode (hera challenge) - that is, the races in the individual localities you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (your challenges) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, various items must be opened: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results obtained with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible scissors is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get the car into a subway tunnel (my roads) where you spend a long time in the dark on the rails (my roads).
On the tacho look at numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (roads of mine), but there comes a subway from the back and leads a non-compromised to scratch.
In our editorial, we'll probably still be arguing about whether it was a blackout of the gamemaker or whether the authors keep us so bleeding.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appropriate and here and there even brilliant.
It's so much more annoying that at some exciting moments, the frequency of replay will be slowed and this will be somewhat dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound play is so much O.K. and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address as wide as only possible scales as young audiences, a soundtrack a la la "of all things" was created - but who buys such a game because of music already?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game wasn't painted by the total unnecessary error mentioned, we could have said with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems to be incomplete.
A class of pleasure for itself, but one should be prepared to look into one of these mistakes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions sensitive."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the roads are smoothed and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite short of her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As she took the term "understanding and open about Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual bodies of the European Union and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have benefited from it by such a lecturer of the Faculty of Law at Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was made, he was too incapacitated - a bold official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say, it has hit everyone's breath, how well he has taken the matter.
"He is a man who is preparing to listen patiently to the seven twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them, and who has, above all, clear ideas on how to move on with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step to agree and improve the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil mill Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda that the European Union lived, lived and remembered in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago referred to it as success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency was described as a major negativity that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
With the Ambassador's words, it went not only to the Presidency but also to the next crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And so the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slender and saving budget, which will be given priority, which countries will be more and less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "I understand about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's a green curly, foreign words, and magic jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how do I really know whether you really want to be in Brussels, whether you want to be a cool, round gourmet, or some big bananas or if someone really wants to ban us from the neighborhood?
It would also have liked to use the EU floor to obtain more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or more speeds in view
According to EU ambassadors, the Czechs are calling for Eurosceptics to be more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in the European institutions is much more bitter.
Many factors are due, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French next to me says, "He, what are you putting together your heads - is that your V4 again?" and making it a pretty acid mine.
According to Mrs Vizenévé, the EU is expecting, in the future, particularly strict rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As much more real than a 'European Federation' it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries beyond the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only the countries should cooperate who want it and those who don't want it should be quiet away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Ms. Vicenová.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, according to all the issues affecting the EU as a whole by all the Member States and not only the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The IBM Innovator enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is most accurate, then this would be the word "longevity".
For the general public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although it has been lost for a century since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already betrayed the slogan that countless world problems could easily be solved if people were ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" was so marked that the life of the future giant should be played (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the basic corporate culture prepared by Watson.
"For us from IBM this long-term thought means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore a success for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society during the first century.
We hope to create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company for the occasion of the anniversary.
Translucency system
Watson operates in the thirty years of social care of his employees - in a way similar to that of the IBM company in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had a paid holiday, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as a workwear and a well thought-out remuneration system for the best new and businessmen.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also elusive.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan at the top of IBM is replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometti.
It has been in IBM for 30 years, so far it has taken the position of the VE, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called online brainstormings, many of which have grown up with future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company there are almost half a million people employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unsubstantiated position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had rather the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," George Colony added of Consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company himself points out, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its family name "Big Blue", has grown to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and has already been awarded the Nobel Prize to five of its employees.
Its most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, strikecode or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars stock exchange value (market capitalisation) IBM this year was the second largest technology company (even after Apple), with its first acquisition of Microsoft since 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with the own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not get emotionally involved in the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands with its operating system Windows and falls.
Successful Technologies
IBM’s gains are largely involved in services, software and hardware involved in a fifth of each.
In 1990 hardware was represented by more than fifty percent of the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the recent financial crisis for the first time began as a storm over the world.
Here too IBM remained faithful to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the global economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be overcoming the current crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's profit continues to grow.
The company log of IBM says: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also win the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to global flights
The IBM (International Business Machines) company, founded hundreds of years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tableting Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took it in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possess technologies such as the famous card clocks to register the start and end of the work.
The architects of this new company were Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him with the company's leadership.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name has already been betrayed, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from barley and cheese cuttings, up to boxes.
In the first four decades, when Watson was leading the company, he doubled its turnover to $9 million and the company expanded to and from all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he sat in the boss's chair for forty years, only then he was disbanded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, NASA's IBM technician and computer helped fly to everything - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also to the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus became fully involved in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying for over the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet.
It is intended to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and in urban management.
In the commercial sector IBM introduced the Smarter Trade platform to help dealers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM established a settlement in the former Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a world-wide top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Richtářová over her unfaithful streets:
Iveta - this ass can keep you, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtāřová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Josef Richtář (53) from the guardian of Iveta Bartošová (45) became his lover, Darina still had the hope that Joseph would come home from his rosary dream.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Richtářová.
When Darina Richtářová of the singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, she would probably not have fallen into the dream as with her husband.
When Iveta pushed her out after 30 days and returned to Ríčany, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he's even known publicly that he loves her.
In time, Darina relegated, yes, it seemed even as if she wanted to reinstate herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář is no match for who his wife sleeps with
If Richtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive unopened arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rightářová; but she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and was alone on mutual consent.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door to him has so far brought dignity to Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, it doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I'm making the purchases."
"With Darina I'm normal, only the bed we don't share," said J. Richtář (the leaf) blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I know it's my fault, I've fallen in love with Iveta, and that's why I take every responsibility.
The worst female intruders: How are you?
When the men are asked to name some typical female intruders, they immediately shield some prompts from the sleeve.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let a few unsatisfied reviews happen again, which allow men to shed the blood in the hell?
Search for purchases
Do you expect them to be greedy?
Do you have to buy at least one hat weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more at the same time?
Then, in your case, it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their purchases half-way under control.
But hand on heart, which woman already insists on trying to look for a well-sitting upper dress just through a dress shop and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though buying for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about it, how often they've told their husband - you'd better stay out...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"Should I lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Can I ever do anything to you?"
Do they have any knowledge of this?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who have regular possession of them as they look.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more indisputable.
First order and purity
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, tear the bands - and at least this twice a week.
Swim with her partner, because once again he tramped dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you slammed the kids, because the straight-cut wash basin is dirty again and because the glass at the living room already has fingerprints again, but where does the polishing make so much effort?
If you are suffering from this kind of "devianz", then you should know that you can't overstep anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not at the top.
Finally, this immeasurable purity seal can also damage the relationship and, above all, the peace in the family.
Fingerprints
"Smooth tournaments come into the sink."
"Do you really want to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A our handle is not simply thrown on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyranny, don't be surprised that that brings him to the palm.
Of course, that's not a bad idea, but they just want everything that's in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much to mutilate.
Clutch and Tratsch
Some women would like to chat and chat, where they are swapped behind their back, or even slammed, or they're slamming bonds.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to discuss such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every woman of us has a bit of a harmless claw and a tratch in the camp.
Hands on your heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with clichés of the most precious calibers, of which nothing and no one is holy, who are probably everyone in their surroundings and who are particularly at risk for women's collectives.
Jagr and Voraček help Philadelphia with their assistance to win
The ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the NHL on Monday's game with two assists at 5:3 p.m. of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
A user of the review of the nine-and-thirty-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and was called to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jagr's co-player Jakub Voraček.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists against him, he had Giroux a great evening prophecy.
"Just before the game, I tell him he's hit a hate trick today."
I felt that somehow."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," said Jagr, after which Giroux already reached a door at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later also had the second hit "a Czech track".
Voráček won the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first-third's depiff, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hand, but the second-third belonged to the flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr, he achieved his third hit, followed by Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't fall into life if I were to play with such an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my partners put her game on me and now the spirit is turning around," smunzelt Jagr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - due to the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was suffering from a gunfight, came to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he was in too many two against a success.
"Excellently acted proger still in our zone."
"He picked up the puck, I took the ride and (read) pulled to the further steps."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it's hit," Voraček described the party's last hit from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech dissident of Montreal Jaroslav Špatak injured himself in the game against Buffalo and separated in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candys, in addition to their experience, also offered Beck their leadership an unlost in Penalty Shot 2:3.
One of the penalties could not be changed by Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related outcome in the defensive - the game only played with five opponents at the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played the meeting with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"At every turn a wave of attack after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We'd have made the game easier and we'd have to get the puck out of our third."
There were also reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the opponents.
The Czech Torhütter Ondřej Pavelec refused thirty shots of Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended up a series of five defeats, five different shields had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five registered state travel offices in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sportsman, CKM, Recrea and car tourist.
The travel offices then sold only trips to the Socialist Eastern blocs, in the West only selected at that time.
And so Czech tourists travel to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschý on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a provincial course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc (so also the Czechoslovaks).
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Since then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the west, but had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
Even so, the thing hasn't been going on for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange issue - the condition for an exit to the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not even allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to spend the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the west.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekly homes and dots - a habit that continues to this day.
The current 1989 revolution followed a reiser revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While by 1989 a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A powerful paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted to the neighbouring Western European countries, which resulted in a strong wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks just couldn't get enough of their trips to the west for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
Thus the Czech holidayers slept in the tent in the park when traveling to Paris, for who had already had the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travels from Czechs was at that time one with canned, beer and permanent cheese, etc. full-packed box space.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely interchangeable Czech Krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the averages increased, which in 1997 brought in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights, thereby allowing the flights to negotiate quantitative discounts in comparison to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had a non-monetary payment with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-total" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying each year in distant sunny countries; 12 exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic this year.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States opened a visa obligation for Czech tourists, thus finally joining our country in the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head for a single holiday stay.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again threatens a pact.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been a president, and the successor of Ivan Haszek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymbork.
So far, there is still no agreement on which electoral order should be chosen.
And without it, there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
In June Haszek returned from his function, urging his colleagues to join in the retreat and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Haszek, the old quereles between the two chambers of association again broke out, which cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This was shown to be stone and clear on 16 September when the new president should be elected.
The delegates of the main assembly had come to the People's House in Prague, quarter of Smíchov, for the negotiations led to no outcome and it was not just about the choice itself.
One could not even agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the meeting - only the statutory representatives or the officials equipped with a full power.
In this only point, at least part of the agreement was reached, which included the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not held on the basis of a representation on the basis of full power.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue to persist.
Nor did the Executive Committee give any more clarity to the matter at which its meetings - whether regular or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is, how should we proceed in the third round to avoid a pact situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the constitution or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, representing the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives higher percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Mähren is allegedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side is on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two pre-rounds no longer have any sense, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the sea side, which was best placed not to bend the electoral order, but to choose a valid statute.
Tomáš Paklík is a surprise to it, even if it turns out that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is likely to be opposed to Pelta.
"My wish is that the majority will be chosen according to the constitution."
"In order not to be considered foolish replacements, as at the last main meeting," said Victoria Plzeň, the owner (the football club) who for the first time applied and in his opinions limited himself above all to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his view, the new president will be known in Nymbork and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football-EM today would certainly contribute to the satisfaction of the farmers."
"If the football rides only on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three fans, both at professional and regional level.
Rijkl's the one that's holding up.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of bows and pearls, but there are some efforts to "justify" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a re-blocking at the main assembly is not excluded."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally prevails," said Rachel.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides will not remain.
Some negotiations should probably take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be complete until the skill game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rijkl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so they were searching for a replacement variant, but as part of the executive committee they were still able to get to the site of the barage game.
Finally, however, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, which is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association.
It is a great deal at stake: state grants, the credibility of the Czech football and also the upcoming ČSTV's main meeting, which should guide Czech sports in the face of the financial problems of Sazka.
Paklík is fighting for the president's position because he does not see any suitable candidates.
If Tomáš Paklík, the leader of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary main assembly could have formed a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), he would not have been in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good advocate, I would fight for him and refuse to vote."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an appetite," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to dueel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, to the top of the FAČR.
Paklík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will think about the role of the chairman for only one year, i.e. by 2013, until the end of the regular general meeting.
In the position of the president, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too close to the football event.
"I have spoken to some people on the subject in person."
"Near to believe that some told me that they were currently not going to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the president of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' voting on major meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paklík that Pelta would have the president's position.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in the Czech football it would not go forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, fights football twice bad," Paklík stressed.
He also argues that Pelta's name was committed some time ago in connection with telephone hearings to investigate corruption in a case, but that Pelta was punished.
"I don't know which prestige should bring a victory from Pelta to the football."
"And how would we be there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta is president," but he sees something more secure.
However, if Paclík wins in Thursday's election, he can imagine a future collaboration with Pelta in detail.
Similarly, another candidate, Rajchl, who had supported the Paclík before the main meeting in October, ended with a Fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great abilities."
"For example, I could well imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he was able to lead the union as a manager."
"But I am not in matters of which I understand nothing," said Paklík, who had taken care of the matter in September, that he was at the top behind the call of the judge's commission with Luděk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paklík himself claims that he feels that the role of the president of the federation has grown.
And he rely on his ability to run private companies, since last summer he is also the leader of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain groups of interests, which tend to influence disciplinary and vocabulative commissions, what is expected to happen in adverse situations," Paklík said, who does not make a hero out of his antipathy, for example, with the Head of Sparta, Daniel Kretínský.
As one of his priorities, he advocated the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby the political top politicians for more money from lottery taxes in sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new president should devote himself to."
"When it comes to taxing gambling as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they also have to cut and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club is also not seen as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR should be "over-shared".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rachel with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly the ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense in my opinion to transfer my shares to a third party in the Pilsner Club to return after another half years," Paklík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will exclude a pact situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairman's office, Miroslav Pelta, will be able to make sure that the FAČR will receive new statutes that will exclude disputes about the election order from the front.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's negotiations in Nymbork, and believes that the election struggle will be cut off in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus on the national team and the profit of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, and so he was able to help him to defend his two-month pauses on the leadership of the football and to present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is led by someone, the man who is primarily associated with the Jabloneser Club, who has been acting at Sparta for many years as well as at the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems with the election, the euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Haszek is responsible.
"Leaders were approved at the June General Assembly of Statutes which were not as perfect as they had all been adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a president from September," Pelta said.
In particular, he used the revision of the main document of the Association as a means of locking the delegates.
"If I become president, then I will accept his personal responsibility, and I am prepared to bear personal responsibility if it does not. "
"That's a fundamental thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to isolate himself from his opponent.
Earlier he had announced that he could present a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, who he recognized for his legal education and knew well that his opponent would be his first representative.
Even Tomáš Paklík did not attack for a long time, which did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He's been moving in football for over a year and can already refer to some success."
"But his attacks were suspended and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"That is why many doubt his real character now," answered Pelta to his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations that he had already spoken in September.
His opinion is that his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes of games to the national team.
And these are supposed to be Czech football hangers.
"I would also try to end all business - from the Cause of Bohemians to the rear of the Canal of Corruption from last year."
"At the same time, I would cut myself off on negotiations with the private and public sector in order to secure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry to the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I had to be familiar with the work content of all the employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the long anarchy, nervousness is understandable.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming main meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday do not necessarily go to Nymbork.
"If it really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the third round, then we will go over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rijkl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former vice-president, Jindřich Rajchl, was to be elected as the new president of the Czech Republic's football club on Thursday, this would probably miss many people in the association.
Rijkl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that the previous president, Ivan Haszek, started.
"As President, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Start from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"That's why I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," said Rachel in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the skills of the Executive Committee so that each member devotes itself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football can take place in every segment with miles of steps."
Many would not be satisfied with this because, rather than criticizing the work of others, they had to start working hard themselves now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered, not to run any more.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't throw a knot between my legs and any step I'm asking," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
It is evident that he is also motivated to continue the work he has begun under Haszek.
"In two years we've been doing a lot of work and I don't want to just throw it away."
"Proceedings have been launched, which are likely to come into effect in a few years, and I would only see worse that someone stopped them," he said and expressed his concern that in the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return in the days before Haszek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"He is behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
I may have some ideas, but I don't think I'd be partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not just the chosen ones," said Rijkl.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a Czech chairman.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really have to do the best for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a imperial part, whose winners then rise to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three matrimonial clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for the young players in the walls," says Rijkl.
Because even now the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paklík has joined the fight for the role of the president, Rijk is not sure to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I seek strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear success lies behind me," Rijk said, who also sees the savings of ten million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly due to the fact that the association does not draw on a single string.
While he says of Pelta, "He is previously disqualified from helping the Czech football to new confidence," he holds the second rival - Paklík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Haszek started and would obviously not change the personal occupation in the Commission."
He would certainly not want to bend things to his favor," explains Rijkl over his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
From Julia Stanek
Planchbecken in Ufo-optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Anyone traveling through Europe can experience its blue wonders - and after a tour of town or a hike the tired legs in spade baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip for the past one and a half years, one in her luggage would not be missing: her bathing suit.
Back on the water, she looked high in artificially shaped domes, swam across marble-puds waiting on them on the banks, and stood over acribically restored youth dolls.
If you liked a bathroom, she took it quickly into her notebook - as well as valuable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored Architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents in her book "Badefreuden": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical baths in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much on her hat, Meder says - just in the water, that's different.
Angry only that swimmers have to find themselves with blue cakes and chlorgestank, while joggers can breathe the influx of wild forests or a happy bird exchanger in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the woman living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface double architecture
Placers in the spring basin and essential sauna-oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are handled, so bet.
And if the builders have worked hard, the swimming halls can be a true eyebrows: "The state of a floor has a water surface in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high waves, coloured tiles, springboards.
The small-informed "Badefreuden" tape conveys knowledge on 190 pages about the history of architecture and culture of historical wellness oasis - but especially makes a leap into the blue.
Notable examples were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an early car park (Höhlenbad in Miscolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkali-containing water and found in a bottle-shaped building (Városio Termáfördö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye from the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the drive on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bath guests in the long field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three to the top of the open bowls it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ostetal reach the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector took the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell at Schwefel, in the Arpád bath in Hungary's Békessaba, it smells so strongly to be landed in a health bath, which you hardly believe to be.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing helical water, which is almost black and its sleekness clings to one's skin as soon as you get into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sunny bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrace.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
As the lake cast a glance through the red-white-yellow window of the youth style building, she saw how uncooked among the tiles waving.
On the other hand, the fall took place in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages already have this bathroom behind them; you can discover not only neo-romanic elements that came from the times of its creation in 1844, but also a maurice hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bathroom of the pool Kenner Iris Meder - and not just because it originated from the Black Forest.
"It is already a performance to blend so many components into such a great unity," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obvious only sideways.
Agra's Spectulation
Deutsche Bank lets the raw material business light up
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group Chief wants to have consequences.
Hamburg -
The case is clear for the Germans: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks with agricultural raw materials, such as wheat or maize, are speculating.
Two thirds of the respondents are asking the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it increases the problems of the world's poor.
This is the result of a Forsa inquiry on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the laws on global raw materials exchanges drive prices up - and that is why banks are guilty of global hunger problems.
The consumer's campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were intended to ensure traders against price fluctuations.
But at the moment most experts agree that the sugar has been disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the proposals and said that no business was "to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank on the ground".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the proposals from the Foodwatch report.
Until the end of the year, the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the German Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank wants to announce the consequences of the bank.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete return.
Ackermann based on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The laws at rising prices of food show particularly drastic how careless banks today are damaging the general good."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio where money is used for food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann who suffers from hunger or the name of the German Bank."
The view of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group Manager wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of Management would not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to be able to do so, he would hardly have to cut himself off - so that his followers would have to do it.
Any second would terminate the raw materials plant
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Thus, only 11 percent consider it legitimate for the Deutsche Bank to offer facilities at which food prices are charged.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each second, the survey would announce all the facilities in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43% would be charged by such a bank, 49% would be charged to consider cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The surrounding Pavilion
From Ingeborg Vienna
An architectural story with heights, depth and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 earned prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and burned.
Now he's reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous horns and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavilion then got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made architects so famous that he built the next world exhibition of Austria Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus a gun-like addition to construction in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
Pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been refurbished at the Vienna Südbahnhof after the world exhibition in the garden of Switzerland and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called.
The building was suitable but not spacious and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long that contemporary art in Vienna was given a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now rebuilt the Pavilion, now called "21th House", and is used in future as a museum for contemporary art.
The Belvedere Museum, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition there - a coincidence in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, who promoted art historians with remarkable careers, among other things in the youth as an ice artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, put the refurbishment to politicians and thinkers, she obtained public funds and private sponsorships and set up the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a café and a bookstore should exist, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strong surveillance, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "unfortunately important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "hard every weekend".
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost when he moved to Vienna and used it for generosity and ease.
The building was "an energy shield", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, the glass fibre reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled lids have been repaired.
Two underpants provided space for the new use, a reduced light grave between the house and the street provides for the lighting, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been carved in the old red-brown stainless steel color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And that's all under the strict supervision of the mental authority and with a small state.
"It often had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also true to the Mental Protection Office," Krischanitz says, pointing to a rough ground in the underside.
Despite all the constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It was hard to be with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "get a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main railway district", with office and residential houses.
And another accident may still occur: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city about a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway planted winter crisis package in millions of heights
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent accidents in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn additionally spends over 70 million euros in a newspaper report this year.
The "Image" section reported beforehand on a group-wide crisis plan, up to 2015 investment of around EUR 300 million was planned.
To this end, better availability of vehicles and rail networks should also be achieved in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snowfighting on rail stations and rail climbs to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free rails up to the start of operations and 90 per cent of the operating conditions within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Head of the Rüdiger Grube had warned after a summit with government and industry before accidents and delays this winter.
In the past winter, the train had serious problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the Railway Agency for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have ICE train axles tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in the Cologne Main Station had an axle fracture.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States
After the Tumult about Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new inconvenience from the USA: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home for the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry crisis is still taking up its past in the USA: the Frankfurter Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in a comparison to deal with disputes due to the plete of five major social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led the companies with false promises for the purchase of financial products; they would have undermined the risks.
Such papers have been lost to value during the financial crisis and the banks are rising to the bottom.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties going to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not raise any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Banks and is in charge of consulting to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billions of serious damage caused.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also had other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the mortgages in question, these are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
This is the basis for this house credit.
When the US Immobilienblase was placed in 2007, this became a number of financial companies to be hanged.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank killed Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events have been back for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have imposed countless complaints in order to obtain recovery or to resolve errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have transferred the two US state-owned Immobilier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to mortgages in the volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to complain about FHFA, which is several businesses worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters meet for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as irreconcilable and declared its intention to refuse.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only expected to be poorly forecasted.
Now, however, he has read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the sector.
He already had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighting blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US Economics Messenger CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares in value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is thus raised to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM had not even known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that he had taken care of in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
For some time, IBM has been focusing on the liquefied IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
The over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffalo fat had been used by technology firms up to now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, buff fat was added to a freight train, to a lubricant manufacturer or to a machine farmer.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded them with clever investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inconceivable sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
According to the Buffett investment, IBM's share was initially increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion at the stock exchange and is thus among the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, as he said, he doesn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates is a friend.
The threat is reachable
After the discovery of the Zwickauer Cell, Turkish media in the German rule of law are in doubt.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology", which now lives again.
The murder of eight Turkish and a Greek retailer in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremistic background.
This message is responded to in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and concern.
As a result, many German Turks have returned to their minds for a long time: since the fire strikes in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
However, the fact that there is a foreign hostility in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals the extent to which the dimension is not yet visible.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" called the internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and shows that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical soup.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted in particular: she remembered at the weekend with a mob in front of the Brandenburg gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Procurement Agreement.
In happy colors, the meeting was staged - as a story of success.
As an earring, there is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fifteenth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" is not allowed to draw this mental connection.
"It begins to smell," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The conduct of the police and their subsequent arrests are extremely critical in German internet forums.
Why the German authorities were not much more interested in looking for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some show themselves at least rhetorically ready for drastic measures: "There is still a fight here, so the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
"That will be the best self-protection."
"Of the good of the clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany is very much dependent," writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is at risk, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained.
The photo of Solingen's firehouse is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can be found in right violence.
However, the attacks strengthened the Wi-Fi feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past
In the Turkish press, the rejection of German politics after the attacks was particularly condemned: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire blow of Solingen, he sent a message to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the wedding feast in Cologne - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many contributions the Turks provided.
Just as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germans has been in the rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it takes open words.
The Scandalbank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been falling from one crisis to the next.
Now it's about to be a German.
That's what Axel Weber certainly didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that he would begin a nearly spectacular new job in 2013: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucid career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its renewed solidarity and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turn round."
"I am happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had turned all the bank's security systems around 1.7 billion euros in debt.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President-in-Office of the UBS has also been called upon - and all the questions: When does Axel Weber finally come?
Weber was already known to consult the bank in February 2012.
And the Chairman of the Board of Directors will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's going to be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and notary banker and would certainly have had a time of employment.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been cutting off from a scandal in the next years.
Nothing, it seems, will ever be so proud of the Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the slender and solid but also exploited Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, UBS managed 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 billion more money available to customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was put as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The single banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says, "My students were always the subject of the UBS at that time as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I just be so crazy?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something belonged to the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief of Management Peter Wuffli came back in a surprising way, which so far seemed to be a high-tech banker and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had gone.
The bank's investment party had been involved in subprime papers and had to write billions off.
To cover this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in terms of saying and wrote 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who would have fired on some until recently the nose: an intransparency Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so obliterated that you did not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the second-best-paid board of directors, Marcel Opel, returned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank purchased ten billion problem securities from the UBS, the Swiss property company gave six billion francs for a forced change loan that it could become the bank's mediator.
The whole of Switzerland was terrified - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet amount of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," says Bankenresearcher Geiger.
The second one joined the first disaster.
A few months later, UBS capitulated the UBS in the tax dispute with America and was willing to disclose the data of the potential customers who had withdrawn with the help of the bank's taxes.
She also agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unfair profits from these businesses and a penalty payment.
In order to make the UBS known more or less open to help with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had already been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbos of Fever.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank's secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking by lack of speculation and in the asset management by means of tax deduction.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as it was thought, now the UBS will get back to it, so this incredibly unbearable dealer story follows: A single dealer is hungry for 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going on.
And it will be obvious: With the risk management in the investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"In this case, Adolfo has to find that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Financial Professor at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been involved, to become guardians of the world's large assets: no too great risks, for that to be safe for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic, the world was allowed to collapse once.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unscrupulous reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich still fits into the cliché of the inspired Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main railway station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the sprüngli confiserie.
For centuries the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marbled, before thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo are a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes forced - or betrayed - how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds himself.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two big banks.
The UBS has become too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the Angels have also expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say.
"And if so, they've adapted to the seats of the fishing boats for a long time."
In fact, it was the German investment bank that changed the UBS, protected its first high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were authorized by politicians to save the bank that was in front of the bank.
How could it happen?
If you talk to Swiss banks, you see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large banks of Switzerland joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Swiss - and still growing.
It helped to complement the two different pre-banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came with a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Group Chief of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Opel were a dream team," says Bankenresearcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the Hochintellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Opel, the buchman, who has worked from the banking teaching to the top."
But Opel left for the conclusion on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Verud came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the leadership meetings, on which Group Chief Wuffli issued the same words again and again: Goldman Sachs came from the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She introduced the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played with it all the way up.
Business consultants, who were commissioned, however, have shown a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS moved into an adventure that it almost cost its existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgage credits and continued to hold risks - but also kept itself at risk.
Even if other banks were long looking for the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Bankenexpert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to clean up seemed more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have been at the locker and are still alert.
Whoever now runs the Grand Bank has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has come up with all the business models.
Bankensearcher Geiger already has an idea: Conclusion with the investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
That's how far the bank doesn't want to go.
But the investment banking is going to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti of the world will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was thought to be only a transitional solution when the bank suddenly separated from the predecessors.
In the meantime, he has gone through it: He will conduct the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, the Zürich Bank shared on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank in the middle of the 1990s.
It's 3500.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What do you want her to earn money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
He's publicly just saying that he's only going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe loaded US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken courage from the US investors for the weekend.
The government change in Athens and Rome remained powerless.
The dreary industrial production on the continent gave rise to hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general facilitation of government change in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still full last week, not half empty - but now the problems repressed in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were found on the sales lists.

In September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape from recession so soon, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
The investment-like Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle over the hood and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the Group's stock exchange rate and allowed him to record a slightly higher percentage compared to the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffet has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to its own data and now holds 5.5 percent.

Smart rabbits spread out in cities
In many places seeds are considered "problem birds": but from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer spread, experts claimed.
They like one, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: cows have been among the city’s images for centuries, but in many municipalities there are frequent complaints about the dirt and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seeds are no longer coming out of the cities, experts said at the first breast-feeding symposium in the East Frisian Forest.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible routes.
You are searching for an alternative in the cities.
Naturalists also led the problems in cities to flee to the land of the especially protected seeds: chemical use in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing cultivation and the cases of typical brut trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crops are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 pairs of bridesmaids are located in the western coast, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of rabbits in the country area for negative impact lines had been provided.
Critics have referred to the capture of the animals in bird traps and the defeat of knots as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the collapse, brings nothing," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from empty.
Beverage with water or fall trees, often have unwanted consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals vary, large colonies break up and distribute to other places."
Aggravation can only be considered as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away anymore."
Without the border, the problem is not solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of the city said.
It is likely that a combination of animals from sensitive residential areas and occupiers is needed to re-occupied them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens, for a completely different treatment with the animals: "We can finally draw a pick in the face of the best self-consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ascheberger Krägen-Lehrpfad, which informed the sign of the life of the highly intelligent seedlings.
The project will now be adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is every amount of communication that has much to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to come to a delicious bite, but even present their tool themselves as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge tested at least four seeds, how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a shower to the ground to reach a motten larvae.
Without much training, they realized the target size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the pffigs had to solve a more narrower problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small egg with a motten larvae.
With the rush, the birds could not reach their bees.
However, the researchers had laid wires on them.
All four animals formed a hook, with which they then swallowed the egg on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four saws even achieved this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks remained on a coup.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are at EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Guided by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.) Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after the 0:0 out of the example.
In the play-off-back game at the outside side of Montenegro, the Czech had a 1:0 (0:0) after the play (2:0) had been a clear thing.
There was no more burning in Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) achieved the next hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvězdan Misimovic with a transformed treatment meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already won the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in the Play-offs.
In the stadium da Luz in Lisbon Portugal gained a start to scale.
Ronaldo hunted a free pass from about 30 metres to the front of the masks.

The ex-Wolfsburger of the English Tablet Leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball does not exceed the torline (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
After that, Schiedsrechter Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood at the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian punishment, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese.
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial treatment meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which certainly transformed Misimovic.
However, after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Masters made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Peter Jiracek ended up in the 81st minute also the last doubts.
This leads the European champion from 1976 to the fifth time to the EM.
However, the team of Coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) had also been lucky and had to endure a second in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Chech prevented a possible owner by Thomas Sivok (9) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic was shot in the 40th minute from turning from the Straffront border only near the door of Czech.
After the break, the cross-platform had to be saved for the already hit world-class quarter of the Czechs, once again the flutter of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The door just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not leave a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to do so as well as his seat on the WM third-party bank of 2002, the Croatians may be pleased with their fourth participation in an EM end.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost gained a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met with a distance shoe only the Pasteur, attacker Kazim Kazim, also unable to lower the walker in the gate.
After the quake, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, which was made a place for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entrracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni leads to EM
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of the 4:0 success in the case of a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) for the guests.
From the beginning, Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian team prevent the possible leadership.
But it was that way in the 32nd minute.
After a disillusioned defense by Klussmann Pavel Londonk was Ward at the scene and pushed the ball at 1:0 above the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests in the next billions of years in China and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to flow, the Dax group shared on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Stunningly and magnificently Peter Englund's new book "Beautifulness and Fears. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of people who go to the heart.
Here is a tip how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will know these people in English romantic story very well. And these major people will act as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments, in which you, like English men and women, are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe inappropriately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly messengers, fast reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, rather "a book about what it was like". It is about " feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Fear" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inflatable men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, car drivers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives fades like the vocal churches in one church, some to come along, while others to be destroyed.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the defeating war on the Westfront.
"Beautifulness and Fear" walks with an expert view over other areas of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall into bee body, a festive Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsflies are an unresolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war overwhelms the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells at the cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children, and cannon fires in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what happens or why this war is being fought at all.
"Frequent facts", according to Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and rumors."
"Beauty and Fear" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories have been taken mainly by memories, letters and other material that has already been published.
Their life stories can be frightening or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in the details of the collection of small moments.
Many of them act out of lack and self-help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Expectation, everywhere."
"Resistance coffee, false aluminium, false radiator rubber, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammock fat (and lastly served with a false bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes that were contaminated with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food supplements that were allowed in the production of herbs, 511 registered coffee supplements."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to the wildness and says about the war: "I feel that in spite of all this, it is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and so do, as it meant such a facade of civilization and as if there was no barbaria behind his own reinforced and assaulted shirt chest."
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you think of sacrificing yourself, taking a distance, you want to think that this is happening in front of a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," says Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Beast of the New Century": "the word applied and ideologically convinced mass murder in the suit that strikes while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseeable way and there is also free conduct like heroism.
In England, the soldiers who were actively trying to get in touch with a prostitute with a sexual illness to escape from the frontal service.
"The great expression that can be discovered in trade with Gonocoken-Eiers, because soldiers bought and flocked to their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really disappointed call him in the eyes, which led to their being blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is ridiculed and yet unsurpassed and fits perfectly with his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "once upon all, uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as extensive historical books.
England's band participates in an unconventional rest hall.
His book has the most glorious end I've ever read in a book.
I don't give up anymore.
But it's like he took this side with his book with the main people before the nose and burned it with a barwood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned overrun
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing wear helmets.
It was decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in one exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was facing full challenges.
The events of the last few weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the desert and gives homeowners an enormous increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protestors from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster had taken place with a view to Zucotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - in order to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who was familiar with the commands said what he said for a declaration as "practice".
"The few cops involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zucotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was around the Zuccotti Park were the top officials of the resort."
One reason for keeping secrets was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14 officers wanted to spare the park, but then weeks back when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation from Tuesday, including applications from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park go in and out, almost like pendants, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the smallest number of people in the park is stopped," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready to take off at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the messages recorded in advance, which sounded out of the speakers, seemed to frighten many Protestants.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue windows, many Protestants simply gathered their things and left the place.
The police said that up to 1:45 p.m., no tents would be taken to give the protestors time to pack their habe and good together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the police president, said this was their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop them from observing the police operations in the park, and they said that the behavior of the officers was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars in the Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police in the west moved through the large crossroads to personal matters of the Protestants, including the suitcases, the arts and the cloths with clothes, their employees followed the city purification, which was lifted, which was left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of Protestants was near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some of the established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp connect to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Disaster protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until around 3:30 p.m.
The room was closed in 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "unpaid occupation and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In the case that they were to access, a second group of officers waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortland Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these police stations continued to expand the area around the Zucotti Park.
In one place, a number of officials, many of them with shields, were seen driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the north.
Some of the most violent activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 o'clock in the south of Pine Street, a protester ran on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the lot threw a piece of wood.
In the end, an officer and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Advisor's trade union will file complaints against the city due to dismissals
The trade union, the hundreds of educators who lost their jobs last month, intends to declare the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their inadequate influence on the schools taught by poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is likely to be the last possibility that the trade union, District Council 37, in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals, is still open.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst employees in the city and who lost their jobs in a strike on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political enemy that had refused access to a health fund held by the working groups in the past year, with which financial luck should be closed.
This charge was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that was approved in June.
A member of the City Council went back and explained to him that there was nothing more specific in the budget than that school aid workers would be released.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference, which will formally announce the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be made by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as defendants, and eight workers who have been released as defendants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city did not present the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals at the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more help since they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no discharges on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 assistants were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school assistants, who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of marked parents who can organize donations to receive budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each poor school registration.
The trade union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led through the language in a memo in Ireland, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German translation) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from the school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Six hundred and sixty service coordinators were released, not translated," said the draft complaint.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree with Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington had already agreed on the rise in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the rebels, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American integration.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides a resolution, which supports the President John Kerry (Massachussets) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mouth".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House dispute the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or misconstrue the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad group of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. The Chamber also passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission leads to a kind of legislative fire - with a congress which was enough to criticise Obama's conduct in the mission, but not furiously enough to finally take the ground under his feet.
Then the inconsistency of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their own liberation" and "loves the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Relations, or will they be split by the legislators, as the Act of June has done?
The last sentence is against the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the Committee.
Lugars spoke on Monday said he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, this week there is a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every period of Congress law of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or in another area currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlated change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been tabled by this Congress and include a whole range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contracting parties - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their lives - the opportunity to boast that they have 'written' such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and the Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation at two times of the President's office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a heresy among homosexuals is just like a change that prevents the burning of flags, an ever-changing template.
Some legislators would also like to allow the repeal of federal legislation if two-thirds of the States reject it.
As eager as the members have proposed amendments, they move as quickly as they have done in recent years.
At 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such changes. at 110th Congress 66.
In comparison with the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures provided by the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Founded but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her during a election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Giffford (Arizona) came up on Monday night on national television. She was alone singing the Broadway song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to the congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she called for words and needed help on her way.
The transmission showed the severe slow recovery of the damage the bullet shared by its skull, the left side of its brain, and its head crossed from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to the Congress in a surprising way to give her triumphal voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, when six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her healing as "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special pursues Gifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a coldly shaved head and a long bowl over the chair.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then their first words, "What?"
After a few days, Gifford's words are another word: "Toast". You want her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's healing: You see the congressional delegates singing with the therapists at Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just When Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Gifford, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on 12 March he had read an article on a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first six people killed during the assassination.
Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to treat medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you didn't win?"," Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will endure and you will recover, and you will return stronger than ever before.
Bodies feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and sailors gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as babies," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it was a good idea.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it really wasn't.
The striking conflicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes amazing American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly taking advantage of them as they do people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who will be commanding troops in Iraq and soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to support him is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unattainable or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger of the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, talks on compassion take place between war veterans in silence and in private.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "stricken, violent veteran under the surface" was hiding, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over a high government post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators were subtle in asking whether he was able to stop the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from fighting.
"When you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The absence of the soldier's lightness is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services in the battlefield are seen by a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely taken out as praise.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commissioned US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military forces the growing pressure to get through rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are accused of non-refoulement in the case of rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Topless Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her casino in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who brought a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if she could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texaner had removed her concerns.
I thought, "But what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd heard my belly feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a complaint they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint, it included 17 complaints, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or provide a proper remedy after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to cut off the cultural compensation of those to be executed? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs saying that their eggs are placed in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has applied to reject complaints.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are present in the newsweek, provide the defence strategy in detail, firstly, that the military cannot be accused of being injured by current or former soldiers to whom it has come in the forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called fair doctrine, the government is not liable for any damage to soldiers in active service.
"The necessary damage occurred during the military service of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the struggle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war areas.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It is at the time that the military is being modernized, says Burke.
And she's not alone in her fight. Three more complaints besides her are pending.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four most important military academys due to the need to promote a womanly hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", the victims of rape in order to get them out of service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of war veterans), in which she proposed discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who reported having been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offered a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e.: Office for the Prevention and Notification of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuses were shown.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in March also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military came before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The lodgers in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the forced rape of the military police less than an hour after the incident.
This night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut at his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six people said they were characterists in the name of the necessary actor, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day the sentence was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the waves were going to be used. I ran away from the courtroom. "
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it ineffective.
In January 2010, she was unfairly released, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaints that Lyman and the other complainants have filed are coming forward is purely speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he points out, "In my view, they should come forward."
What lies between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine in time.
The military goes back a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same fear that brings a liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important to them that they try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her way, Burke, the plaintiff of the plaintiffs, will begin with their hundreds of other complaints for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, which always comes first.
Walls have eyes: How to watch researchers on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was standing for a murder in Norway in July, when 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who supported right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log on to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report by the British Idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hidden personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the website's advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as the marketer has done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of connecting with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users are looking for an inquiry in which, after their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office only once.
"It is a rather new method of research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online leaders of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas manufacturers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this site, which you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you were trying to ask people from the British National Party earlier, it was very hard to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and have never given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook all this goes away - they go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-length on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink the problem than students who hesitated on this topic.
Moreno suggests that similar students, such as resident consultants, monitor the page and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify endangered children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly processing the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (which used first-line data to which only Facebook has access - Digital Freedom Masters have long known that the site should make its large database group available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site watches them whether or not they want it now. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey from which they don't even know anything?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it's just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and every amount of social life still takes place offline."
"Calt and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood in two ampoules where 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegian temple retreat," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassideologies and that is why multiculturalism is supported."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't blame myself."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he said, "Brievik did not want to allow this hearing to be used as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to turn to the people of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police keep 12 further weeks under investigation, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was behind the castle and the line.
All took part in the goal of getting everything out of a lockdown.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRC.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, there's a piece going on after I've seen the suspect and heard."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted quietly and professionally throughout the entire hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre remark that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
Some may think that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically make it easier for the Kummer and the confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lectures of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After Steve's death on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, and the technique as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find, however, in the most recently discovered job interview, which has been cleared up this week before special film performances on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself named hippie, but he was also an acribian organizer who based it on charts - a man who believed that many managers suffered "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Kringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Facchidiotes" about the break-up of the computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since jobs were forced from Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, and was pleased with the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidios, he says the copies of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easy-to-read film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes this Wednesday and Thursday to the ground theatre.
For someone who is known to reject detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly generous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections in which jobs clearly reflect their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes to an end when he seems impatient to respond to the questions of Kringely and suffocates him to go faster on issues or on the side of the deal of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears somehow indiscriminately comprehensive when jobs evaluates what other companies do in their opinion right or wrong and represents their own vision for the future of the computer.
It is a matter of reading posthumous values of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the desired dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he took off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to lead a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalize the book management at Apple.
Surprisingly, as costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were merely assumed and then adapted to "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
As the Pope was adjourned:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could get involved in the phone company and otherwise have remote speech.
Much has been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorisation, is striking.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another one while crossing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half a dozen times around the globe and when we went to the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," he says.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would happen without her Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the middle of the night through the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to speak with the Pope, while so well they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, they had to leave before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and did not prepare Bill Hewlett's suggestion):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and calling him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown holes, and I loved him.
I would climb up and hang on this machine at HP as a teenager and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
On several occasions in the interview, Jobs talks about how to discover new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the construction and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember beating arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he was brought back to life, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants lived with their visions in Stoplern and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copycat or printer, na and?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are people] who ultimately lead companies and the product with which people are forced out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopolization, is being cut off by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - handicraft.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They won the defeat of victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
"There's every lot of handicraft between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your enemies.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all gather...
Finally, it runs out on taste, it runs out that you try to put yourself together with the best witness that people have created, and then try to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists claw.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas diner with opponents of health laws, accepted as court case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the political question of whether to hear an attack on President Obama's health law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the office that the case will be brought before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint raised by 26 states against the extensive reform of the health system, which was decided by the Congress last year, a law that became the target of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic debate is expected in March, which is likely to appeal to the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time when the ruling is announced.
The lawyer standing before the court and claiming that the law is to be sought is likely to be Paul Clement, a general attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which advocates the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in a Washington hotel.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republicans' Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the diner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they did, they would fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events laws close to and from other organizations, with the judge not to be a speaker, honorable or according to program no guest of such events."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the related offices, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in alarming moral and regulatory activists, was the result of the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas.
"This shocking breach with morals and the opposite of the code is punishing the complaints of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with floating procedures in court."
Their actions and their support for a donation for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would be too easy to mix with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general lawyer under Obama's government when the first legal attacks first came before the court.
Their critics forced Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of pre-emption, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unintended.
Kagan doesn't make arrangements to do this.
Boeing pulls record order from 18 billion dollars to land
Air carrier Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with one option on 20 additional aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really a rare message that a company receives an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total at a record sum of $18 billion.
Also unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend his greatest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The hamer's warrant came from the air carrier Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it in 2011 at Dubai Airport, an option for the purchase of 20 additional aircraft that will increase the total price of the list to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner, which greatly improved the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is worth more than $1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a businessman of Morningstar.
"The quality of this special customer is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices is usually damaging to airlines, since this is one of their biggest cost points, not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural assurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check that attacks the A350 position.
Boeing's victory at the Air Show comes four months after Airbus announced, one would move the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was moved to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher utility and scope.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race around the Governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent national elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for government positions in the Western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the day of trial is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have only barely hit Claderon who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Party Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Party of the Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still the current Governor, came to place three, a difficult defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, lies with drug dealers and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still taking place.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates were out of fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reprehensible the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PR in the race for the President's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory will give us a good look next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its difficult debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB with headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations of the world have to do "all in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which looked at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We all sit on the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then with all the means."
The European Monetary Union has been in a difficult debt crisis in recent months.
In the past few days, Italy's interest rates have increased dangerously and the prime ministers have fallen both from Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is worried that the global economy could collapse into recession and lead to calls for the leading emerging countries to come together to support the Eurozone.
Mr Nag said that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power", in order to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the withdrawal of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we have to get a high level of growth."
"There is no option, it is an assignment, because elsewhere we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the right to help the rich Europeans when facing major economic challenges themselves.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at the American Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India to help Europe, of which more than $800 million or less per day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks go 50 to rent and spend their holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the many and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for 2011/ now threatens "risk of graduation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said harmful threshold markets had to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defence cuts
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta urged the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security undetected, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the pentagon halls to the war grounds in Afghanistan and civil river bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cutbacks of $450 billion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cutbacks of $600 billion or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot complete the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be humiliating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, leading to a so-called adoption, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a stopover of many new projects.
"Even a high cut, carried out in such an unimaginable manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unimplementable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves freely from most of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians to reach the goal with certainty of border probability."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alarm society."
The cuts were finally met by the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the attack, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and attitudes that support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be reduced, which would result in late payments to war dealers and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of an attack by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are very opposed to this draconic action," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published a letter to Panettas.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly not that we should be forced to."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senator's new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to remove the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unmistakably said the possible cuts, although he had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture that might appear - a military with a scarf, but without a kernel.
"It's a ship without mattresses."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force Squad without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paperman, an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of struggle that lacks moral and alarm society and that is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She's letting a man get really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our worldwide employability and intervention, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those that were already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the camper F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and the Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the sponsors say it is an important next step to build, so that possible dangers can be linked by China and other opponents.
How to Remove a Lie
A look at the current strike lines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate by the Republican, Herman Cain, is concerned with becoming a lord of several women's sexual assaults. Both sides face each other's lies.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Meineid, as it was reported that a retired football coach boy was sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and scare countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he turned on lies that were rejected very quickly by irrefutable evidence.
The former Presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating the campaign funding which is linked to the undermining of an exceptional affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the medical circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term of office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky.
Stories about school and college exams are widely distributed.
There were occasions when teachers gave their students the test answers so that they could do well in their performance checks themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and swings are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Like studies, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered nightmares.
Another study shows that strangers lie three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To identify lies or "to discover lies" is one that is important for everyone, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a society game such as Scaraden, where it is intended to call "Have You!", the development of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at respected universities, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths were removed from the lie.
Lies look into one's eyes.
They're stumbling, stocking, growing up and not always falling down.
However, we must not conclude that these liars are hard to discover and to escape.
A trained liar can go through the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim that fine facial expression, question and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of decommissioning, and it is clear that decommissioning is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in the truth in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at apprising other people to awaken their interest and control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men lie more "self-orientated" than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been removed as an offender, others feel less guilty of having this person angels.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called Basining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the smile, the voice quality of your test person.
You should know better when someone usually trips with the foot, so they don't blame him unfairly when he trips during a meeting with the foot.
Then look at the references of more precise verbal and nonverbal manners.
Consider these additions as alarm bells that scream, not as proof of a decay.
People who are deceived may be puzzled when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet are pointing towards the door or they refuse to go out, change their position in a significant way or show a "rest after the setting conversation", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questions often signal false that a settlement conversation is over just to keep an eye on after this relaxation after the settlement conversation.
Also, watch out for the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's exorbitant is famous when he used the form of the past, when he claimed, his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or if one repeats a clever question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a clever question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... to the best of knowledge and knowledge."
As a result, the answer will be seen rather than true, so the alarm bells often scream.
There is no magic means to get rid of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which it is possible to get rid of them.
Thanks to these abilities, anyone who is rarely a victim of fraud can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is processed by late US approval after risk
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, causing trade unions to become angry and at the same time to be relieved of environmental protection, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills will be transferred to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Parbax from TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline would be finally approved, even with a different course.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision was made regarding a federal permit for the project until the new possible course was checked, which was the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline had to go through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska's legislators, who are against the plan, weigh down the laws to force a return from the Sandhills region and Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the environmental impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the head examiner of the Ministry had requested a separate survey of the verification process, which focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was set up by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant for Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an unmatched choice as it is in contact with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complained that she allegedly forced a child out of fear to break
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a fatal accident, which would have caused her little daughter to be so afraid that she would have given up in fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18 months old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10th when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Rosane Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Rosaanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You should not delay your daughter near the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to gossip - she used the F-word and the A-word and was very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was shocked by the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to refrain from accompanying her and be dragged to a waiting car," said Rosana Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a non-injurious claim, but the family attorney Sam Davis said he did not count an honorary and plans the family, the money they get, the child cancer aid will be paid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is placed on the day a child gardener wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate bias slows the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year, in which Mario López Valdez, who himself referred to himself as the initiator of the change and who was concerned with great hopes for economic growth, is at the government. However, due to the climate bias, it cannot be the speech of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of agricultural heights, but also the growth of the state economy narrowed and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which has been slowing down in other sectors of the economy.
According to a report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity in the Mexican state has steadily increased unemployment by November. In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Statistica y Gegrafía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloas had no employment, corresponding to 4.53% of the population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in funds by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the congress, because for those who prohibit the dollar, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest it or use it for anything else," he explained.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also includes a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has dropped. This is on the one hand due to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which allows unemployment to rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the people in the country who work without paying social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, are for unemployment and black labour, according to the statistics of the Instituto Méxicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat del Labora y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the total national average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to the decrease in economic activity and the growing unemployment, in 2011, the highest drop in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretariat de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted from January to June 630 597 dollars, corresponding to 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143 312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from enterprises in the Tertiary Sector.
The Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, in July, the Government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to re-activate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The country Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November there was no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic interests in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, Mario López Valdé's first year of government was apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the country government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really sensible this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and we need to make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-established government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to call for an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. We will therefore close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of the Patronal Republic of Mexico (the Association of the Interior of Mexico) in Sinaloa, stated that it was necessary to start the state to make more productive activities more dynamic.
"In general we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic occupation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts to improve railways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current government has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that the work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still much work ahead of it," he said.
Prison for 8 kg Marihuana
At five years' imprisonment and 100 daily sentences, a resident of Navolato was sentenced because of the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The Public Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health - here the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers in the monitoring of the street Cipriano Valdez in front of watch post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white delivery car in which he kept a black cloth in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the goods seized were handed over to the judge of the district and the penalty is still in the courthouse.
Debts for construction work
The social constructions provided for in the Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Publicos and 3x1 programs run risk for migrants, not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the municipal social development authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it has provided for the three programmes, which exceed 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federation and the community had committed funds to the construction work, so that it was expected that the construction would be delayed.
"12 million must be taxed, and although the year is about to end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a share in July," he said. "To be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already progressed far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to meet its obligations, so at the beginning of its reign, the community had to take up a loan of 7 million.
"This has already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have enough economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the State had not put up to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the State authorities were obliged to pay this appropriation, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Just 12 million must be taxed, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Palace and gave rise to the submission of the conversion of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for the enforcement of the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the Bill with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to enable the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the bill of law against constitution, since the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulations, which would therefore be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the rule of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero agreed to the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives filed constitutional complaints against the Bill. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero did not object to the Bill and put in place all the activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the House of Representatives, without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed no agreement with the project's arguments, meaning that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if one would do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because it leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it has made better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The increase in translation, she said, was a shift in the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which not only has technical points of view, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "make the whole system work necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics which lay the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital conversion, although they had high specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government, with the issue of the bill under appeal, would enter into the powers of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting list in Michoacán is considered individually
According to the PreP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the voting lists is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Program de Resultados Electorales Preliminaryes (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governors' elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes not yet counted in total 6074.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that, just last November, the electorate had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise the local regulations with the reforms of the states in the long term.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Range avoided publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits provided for by the argument or dispute.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative authority and considered the official's vote on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "decisive or impose a veto against it".
Maria de los Ángeles Landeral explained in an interview about the possibility of the individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, the possibility of the local electoral authority being able to count the voting list in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be counted in part The results in the protocols may not be agreed; the vote counting and counting protocol is not in force or is not owned by the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, the total number of fully completed ballots may be calculated if there is a difference between the required winner and the second-place winner, who is equal to or less than one per cent, at the beginning of the meeting, there is an explicit request from the party or coalition president, the second of which is the said candidates.
The voting count may also be carried out in its entirety if, after completion of the proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the required winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become a second candidate. In that case, the electoral packages that were subjected to a partial calculation would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second seats is less than 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés made this Sunday's day at Saltillo, his place of birth, down. On Monday, the death scene and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant was that his ash would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After a funeral, the family of Bacio Cortés returned, along with the others, to the capital city of Coahuila, where they took part in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the mayor's ashes landed on the hall at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends arrived.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. His former teammates of the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, were involved in his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always told his family and his friends that," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believed that he was standing in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to join the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even sink him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream to be a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagú to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old after Zapopán, he went to graduate from his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what was best for him: fly a plane.
A final separation
The commander of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all due respect under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honors were granted to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leader and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985, and he also found himself outstanding in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter that he was flying destroyed, including the State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority.
At 6:05 p.m., the secure remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings, and other members of the family, students, and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military personnel presented to the media eleven persons arrested in the same place in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a graceful escort in a deserted Finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

On Wednesday's education of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the end of the economic collapse is to offer the battle.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the end of the economic collapse is to offer the battle.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm government training.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats-combined cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on government training.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to complete these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government training, but his comments show that the obstacles are overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. In the meantime, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to adopt a strong savings package required by the Europolitans in order to regain the confidence put forward in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's tail was still increased by the declining market situation, due to the Italian state bonds being charged with 7 per cent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government according to all the forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success of Montis was greatly enhanced by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who had to return on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, as so far many of its members have voiced their opposition to a majority of technocrats, the Monti itself.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unfavourable savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the rise of reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks exercises with its notice, a defeat Montis is a disaster, too.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The round of sessions shall be closed on a working day.
Monti was named this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has put an extremely rapid government change in progress.
After a short blow at the end of the last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would withdraw, the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached critical limits for the Italian state bonds.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the process of printing the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spanish have more games than the ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the Buckel.
From the sides of Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 called 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at the San José National Stadium at 15.05 a.m., players from both countries are compared.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selections, the three-coloured team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the British Premier League have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-class European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complex exclusion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings within the Concacacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, which reached an equal standing with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (low level 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will record 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a UEFA recognition last week, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle stormer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Inista with 62, Cec Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Junior Díaz with 48 games and the tower Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team's pages come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have her debut yet.
The historical Torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 matches followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot nine most doors, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett referred to Costa Rica in his tour to the celebration of its twenty-year existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream was realized for them when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who spent the last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will join the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 7.30 a.m.
You are reading an extract from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you realize what that means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to a vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely out, and they experience the most intense days before the concert.
What do you have to say to your fan?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it makes us feel bad to have taken so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're having fun playing there.
We love this country, we enjoy surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the great things about surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered her giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't set limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play each is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played in the repertoire for a long time, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons for the memory why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could have gone into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
For the first time, I think that no one of us has imagined playing once in a great rock band, and that for over 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on these blessings and find it wonderful, even now to be able to make music together.
We like and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have an active share in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Again and again, a band goes out of a city, but it's unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are glad to be still friendly with them all and it is our honor to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has been together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands have spent.
For the first time, I believe that we are all happy to be still alive, and we are also caring for each other.
We are all close friends, so we have opened up musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grow has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be on tour too often, because it's too easy to lose this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as people think they're here because of the music, remember that you have to watch the music and what it has called into life, without neglecting to be a famous rock star. We have never been interested in that.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never issued a record until Andrew Woods died.
We were disappointed to have used it for so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or photos, I think about what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The Las Robertas domestic band is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band has chosen to open?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow's text better when you're playing live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Veder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who are you influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first ones I feel are Geezer Butler, John Etwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the groove alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is rewarding to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, and now she's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there's a few songs on the new album that could work slightly. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing. It's very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly affect me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor informed him.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has been in prison for violations of human rights during his term of government (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tooth cancer, which operate four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would investigate in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Nursingades Neoplásicas for three days in order to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he felt that Fujimori could be approached for humanitarian reasons. However, he did not want this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on Zung cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Further diseases such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the stomach, kidney stones, blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Haftanstalt National Police Special Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official approach by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, launches its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican official Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his published timetable with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the president of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support regarding France's case when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy set up a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear to be tax havens from the international community.
Since November, Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to accelerate the conclusion of agreements for the exchange of tax information to be deleted from the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been at business level since 2004, which has contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cutting-edge installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which this month comes on the charging themes of the world, has been cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which it can be played without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that needs to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game by Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console", because so far, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have already been titled.
Nintendo's speaker stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "successful" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in one included: the first part is "light", to capture the less bad users.
Then the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of games that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can actually choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without the "optic effects" victims, three-dimensional plays must always be played.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo bends the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The narrow-weighted installer must overcome dangerously spicy platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player resists news on the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom provides for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would be responsible for the delivery of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States of America for a 70 million US cash-laundering vow.
This is the end of the trial on the US's request for a release from Portillo so that it can be brought to justice there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government, he did not interfere with judicial decisions and held all the extradition applications he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colums proceeding is a governmental act which is carried out if all judicial and constitutional courts are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000 - 2004).
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be issued when its legal situation is clarified in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his term of government. This debate was preceded by the extradition, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was called into action to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organization Trinijove have led to important results: 6,000 young people were supported in this quarter of the year, threatened by social exclusion, in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the jobs created for this social group are over a hundred.
On the occasion of the annual day yesterday, at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, at which more than 300 people participated, a balance sheet was drawn.
Trinijove was called into action in 1986 in the city district of Trinidad Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the feast held in Sant Andreu, a large number of officials from institutions and institutions who have worked together with the association in these 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives of different directions to election times led to the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist education ministers Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-wing city council Richard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that the present times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the Presidents of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example of how to fight difficult circumstances and provide people with hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
The occupied house in which giant parties were held was spaced
The houseowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
It is clear that the alpine trees of the neighboring house 51 on Balmes Street have found an end.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the building they had illegally held and organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room was held on a fair basis without police intervention.
After the room, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," confirmed the house manager.
The houseowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them had lived - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of mills, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business would have fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house arrest.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the homeowners were making their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Furthermore, the owner of the leisure space was shown by the neighbors because of the disturbance of rest, while according to her statement, the noise did not come back from the disco visitors, but from the housekeepers and in particular from the guests of the feasts that were organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became increasingly and longer in the last few weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the damage was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from her neighbors in the last few weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested that the building be immediately removed and the problems of civil society as well as the disappearance of the city district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the houseowners had been forced into all floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some it had even come to animal count.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against social activities in the building."
Yesterday, another building was cleaned up in the Nou Barris district by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached the street Montreal No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the struggles over the honorary, agreed with the invitation to tender.
The city's call for the 16 doors opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new ones.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the recently disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the New York Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many people back to the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is among the few that do not extend in the north-south direction, but to the upper (geberge) and the lower (the sea).
The Colslerolas classification as a nature park is playing with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park was no longer used, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of Yogibar.
So far it was when the city in September issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
No doubt a door refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's going to put a door on the ground.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection about the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring subject that can be taken back to the two members of this old cast, who meet in the elevator.
And precisely this fact offers the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary", after the attack on the coast to speak about the "front of the mountain", unless the discourse of Ildefon Cerda, which has been delivered over the green apples, has been delivered.
"It should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore von Collserola" gives a "lexical case": one must not imagine "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to be dealt with."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
Risked by the "uncertainty that brings together the design of a public space today" after the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swing" in the forum area.
The first fear is the own restriction on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to define the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [taking advantage of the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is closer to the question, means simple, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modola recalls that there is already a study by the patronate de Collserola that should not "blow ears", although he was grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the closeness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter is that it enables architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "fear" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams (“just the right”, he says) "We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the terms of the tendering, there is no global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions on the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there are no long-term perspectives that consider the area as a whole."
This at least led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would also collapse with the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should without a doubt guarantee that the strips are so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length that a smooth transition takes place between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the officers of the Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is being led against him because of the need for repression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released, after the officer of the Casino Red has given him before the District's Second Criminal Court, which leads the trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey because of oppression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel jonás is to be seen, which forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the house.
After the trial, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal procedure against the Panist Mayor's brother, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministry of Public 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo district of the capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had rejected the crimes for murder and organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he had to have occupied the owner of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the Medieval Security Treaty, since he was threatened with murder.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an instigator of the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, issued a prison regulation. He found that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was provided to blame Jonah for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the court to open it in the opposite direction.
This Monday, the commander of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to be punished, so he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, García Gomez, asked whether he had done any harm and who had apologized to the owner of the court. However, the lawyer kept the name back.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal will be spoken freely. Also, no objections can be raised against the process, and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the House's Plenipotentiary at 3.50 p.m., Larraceabal Breton was immediately set free.
The Registrar, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonah that he had been released and that his case would be put to the record.
He also informed him about the legal order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others came to life.
The Secretariat de Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons came to life indicate that the helicopter was directly involved with his entire unprotected structure against the ground without the pilot being able to launch a emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing at 25 meters high had contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the ramp, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 jobs, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no anti-circumvention components were found in the field in which the machine was found.
"In the search, no parts of the aircraft were found at other locations, the seizure affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 seats, so he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a range of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is preferable to obtain the results as soon as possible, however, these several months, perhaps even a year, could last.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aeroplanes and Aid Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the state of Mayor Presidential was flying at a speed of travel and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the landing."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, counted six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Search speed:
In line with the flight schedules, it was a flight according to the rules of sighting. This means that the crew had to have sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM listed suitable weather conditions at the start. During the next flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexican State, some deeply dependent clouds appeared.
The selected volume size:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Upload location:
The landing coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. It may not have given a loss of control over the aircraft before the landing or a deviation from the flight size.
Distribution of the rest of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was declared in a direct and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was blown on the ground with its untended structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft does not allow fire or explosion to be closed at the accident site.
The last survey results showed several soil contacts.
In the on-site investigations, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above the sea level. The site is off-site and shows a gap of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information indicated that the helicopter could have had several ground contact.
After a detailed search in an area that went beyond the closed area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unprotected aircraft structure had been plundered against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She conducts a research project to find the gene for fertility in children and young people, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Méxicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Pregnancy in Childhood and Youth", with which genetic markers should be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unit de Investigación Médica en Biochemicala (Department for Medical Research, Biochemistry Focus) at the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate study program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports spots of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 a.m. to test with children and young people.
He stressed that the study began at the sport site of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and was continued since 8 October at the sports site of Nezahualcoyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
If the objective of 500 to 600 researchers is achieved, the study will continue in the sports area of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and in the area of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of fertility and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that it would be sought that three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 should comply with the consent and under the supervision of their parents on nutrition issues.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It further indicated that on the said Saturdays, subjects were measured (weight, size, size), blood pressure controlled, and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (try to identify genes in connection with child fertility) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the health care of the health staff on the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of fat-eating boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity increased by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from that of the other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) average was 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African descent, which was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are forced into the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calorie) that we have taken, so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were contained in a comprehensive study of the children in which they would determine whether they showed a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin defects in the neck and inner arms (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the default.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which means missing movement every day, most of the time of the day before television and using transport equipment, instead of walking shortways.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
UNAM's asphalt prevents loopholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 holes if the rainy season in the Metropolitana del Valle de México (city of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warns that if the landing and maintenance of the waste tank is adequate, the number of holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Schlagholes of Technical View", which he held on occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which shows greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of roadblocks and avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a hydrogen connection, some of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a lower - the so-called malthene. Together they give its characteristic numerical behaviour to the road surface.
The zelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very similar and at almost 50°C, while at very low temperatures it is broken.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not the same, but one day it changes depending on weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico-City were mostly a flexible road block consisting of six layers of material, of which the last three asphalts included.
Among the top layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt-based and then solid stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer, was built in asphalt.
If vehicles continue to move and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the roadblock.
"If it were a modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"About the wear layer", he said, "will be a last layer, the so-called wear layer consisting of small stones, i.e. sand, which was also built in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
This road block receives and distributes most of the forces, and also requires a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the ground is wet, water penetrates into the layer and turns out just hard again. This causes a variation of all layers of the road surface, resulting in the appearance of impact holes.
When a blow hole arises," he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be damaged afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs in the first signs."
The member of the System Nacional de Investigados (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important reason for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road block must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this system is respected to prevent frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still waiting for, for example, about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the impact holes could easily be repaired without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty when giving the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be happy to stand on the winning stage, to present a silver crown and the band that she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
The result of this night's Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took over the crown and the cedar, the Department is already engaged in 14 mistletels and melina, the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the famous missions are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. No wonder she was elected to the Queen of Police and Major Rostro Jolie by Vogue, title that also had the beautiful queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her as the First Miss, is that she did not believe in the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the most and why?" she was asked by Martin Murillo Gomez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca addressed the Frastor:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much the literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, finally I think that the book, which was the most important thing for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a pretty deep book.
I'm currently reading `scule and sonne'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called `Leadances'.
One answer, which arose in a little hostility, first because of the term 'civilizing' and second because she had not specifically explained how each book she had influenced.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite is burned by El Valle.
A journalist from Bogotá pointed out that the fact that she was the favourite of all the events and that she had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had been jealous of what the queen was stressing, so she could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathroom on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two lifts at the crowning festival.
Although she was safe with both of them, you lacked the strength and strength that Magdalena and Atlántico represented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a bride "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition will not eventually become queen".
In addition, Valle went to close the press out of the way - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn't convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essential part of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason already that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was involved in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look at the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her flaws of the derriere and fibrosis that you noticed in the stomach area. But that is contrary, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, added that Melina didn't have the best body that there was any better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was hardly to be noticed for me, pressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Chrome magazine of the view, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this price, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bath suit, there was a gruesome prediction that should be true at night. It was assumed that Raymundo Melina had given a bold price so that they would not be allowed to enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, it is true that Melina has since her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent, at the appointment of Colombia's National Beauty Competition in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the Queens, who, despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena, would go to history.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A Lophoscope from Cali went into history as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophopist of the State Prosecutor's Unit (CTI) from Cali confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionaryarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had been a volunteer, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to be in the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to the cracks, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliezer was instructed to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be taken with the Ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, for this was not the least of the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
He armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell, and a pocket lamp compared to Eliezer the fingerprints of the body with those on the printed sheet.
He saw it right: It was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was to inform the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Search
For a dactyloscope from Siïn in Cali, the award that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González gave at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The Daktyscopy is an accurate science without an error rate that can be a key factor in the resolution of a penalty.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many criminals present or do not have false identification papers.
We take the fingerprints off them and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house when he was a thief, because the thief had just stood up at this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe with jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
By means of fingerprints, killers can also be released or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by vials.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be guilty, and in fact a fingerprint was agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it will be linked to the place where the penalty was committed.
A Dactyloscopeist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or band will be used for intake.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the personal unit.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," the CTI expert explained.
He didn't mean it was all the way it would be shown in the SCI TV series.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The "Emphorten" calls out the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zucotti square.
A large part came to the room command and changed its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities this Tuesday to re-enter the Manhattan Square after they had been evacuated from the square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were forced to join the Zucotti Square, where they had a direct arrangement that allowed the "Emphorts" to enter the new tent in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained in the room order and occupied a park further north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zucotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray claimed that the answer to the "empirits" to the space of her tentkeeper, who was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent space of the place and approved the tents to the demonstrators.
The "Emphortes" also occupied a new park, which is located at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could hold the place for at least an hour. But then the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can't give any exact numbers. He assured News Agency Efé that among them he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people were found in this place, where religious leaders were also involved as signs of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zucotti Square (a place in private property) remains closed in the expectation of a proper hearing that is still set for this service day, and the legality of the space in the morning is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the space brought photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave some police officers who were watching the place, which resulted in "some small clashes" as Bray reported, who had shown, some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The directive prohibits the authorities, members of the Occupy Wall Street from being removed from the place and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had already used."
Mayor Bloomberg, in front of the press, explains that the new opening of the public transport space and the demonstrators had been lifted because of this legal arrangement. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-enter tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the space of the Zucotti Square, which was held by almost 200 people in the morning, and which was decided, because the demonstrators "against the right."
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the order for the space of the place because it had " turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to add harm to others", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were afraid "to their quality of life".
"The room in the morning was noble and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of not respecting "the freedom of the press".
The leaders of the "Occupy Wall Street" reported that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actor and model at a Canadian television Christmas season will be the Virgin Mary.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "croner" (balladenshender) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st, will take place in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" and will include a very special young woman Maria's life.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson - also for the Internet distribution of a porno itself, in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a young woman Maria with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comicist of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen as a child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March in Buenos Aires married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and which is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé named North American Kim Kardashian as "Hour".
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spirals of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake that erupted in an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300 000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult economic situation in the world.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were finally completed: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the re-establishment of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital plants recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsustainable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Kenyan attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been raised, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The label for the link to the website of the program
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - to one of the "air-flight currencies" of the investors who fled before the Eurozone debt crisis and the heavy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a tombstone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen score.
While the markets continue to occupy the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda continues to grow.
"You must take into account the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown more clear signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator that predicts the world economy's turning points made it clear that the greatest economic potential would have been the brake.
For he fell about four tenths to Los 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Can Return Doubts
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be confused in the Labyrinth, which emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels is a real conviction of the political forces is slow by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days that were possible for their implementation were too short, the conservative leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in any case, withdraw his request for new elections to the scheduled date on February 19th.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's message does not resolve the doubts in his view: "We have committed ourselves to support the Transitional Government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs the 8000 million Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that he would not have a declaration of commitment to the implementation of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it would not be necessary to address its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties "would not sign an explicit written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika "come back very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what for the payment of the sixth section" amounting to 8000 million euros", although there is no final date yet.
The Greek kneuel still has for a long time threads.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position on the role of small-scale financing worldwide".
The Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has developed into the second donor for this resource for international cooperation. "We are" is based on the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on human confidence."
Yesterday the Queen praised the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "inexhaustible" in order to reach the tens of thousands of years set by the United Nations by 2015 and "particularly the goal of the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than a dollar per day, so below the "poor limit".
Spain "is also continuing to work" on the expansion of the benefits network "to the last corner of the world and it is responsible for this task", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions to the summit, which last Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have noted many successes" and "many challenges are facing."
The Summit on Small Credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for meeting "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would be beyond the poverty line.
The concept of small credit goes back to Spain and the rest of the world on the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus" that Queen Sofia considered a "Act of Justice and Recognition" years ago.
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "beautiful idealist who has been committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project was presented to her yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "the head of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the leaders to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Command"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical order" for the entire democratic state.
In this regard, she stressed that there was an error in linking development aid to economic booms, because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans were a "north and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall on the victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, highlighted "the success", "marginized" people, "who always stand before closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the residents in a city that "your door, which is filled with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes that EU presidents be elected on the basis of a general vote.
The first day of the Congress of Christ’s Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
Europe's future was originally not provided for in the programme, but was spent in the autumn, in particular to provide enough for those activists who regard government policy as being too lax today and possibly Italy's tomorrow.
The European Commission's Presidency proposal proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which, due to their intervention leave, Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, loved no doubt since the three ministers of finance in Europe.
The main idea of the chancellor - like the application - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by strengthening the revision of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but this could also be done in the choice of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote"to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely it is only unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is facing the thing, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the millenstein is laid.
The delegates, in a overwhelming majority, also rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the ECB's budget according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned about calming the climate within his party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sickness reports?
According to family aid, the UMP and the government are now attacking the health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid fund and to give a talk about the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the State - which has always been in the process since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is due to the effort to put the economy into a test of hardness, on the other hand, does not mean that the majority will focus on labour market reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day before taking into account a health report on workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a disabled worker would lose four days' wages without the approval of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A wave that threatens to provoke anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", would, however, help put in EUR 280 million.
And those who have a different symbolic nature: to give the public officials an unremunerated quarantine day in the event of illness (there is still a time for them, in contrast to the three quarantine days in the private sector, no quarantine period).
While these issues are in the debate, the majority also emerges from again the subject of fraud, which this time is aimed at the abuse of employment.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, these are to be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13th in front of the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports appear to be a little unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives, which have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, we are first of all in the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Fund, more than 237 million Euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily findings in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion Euros 5% of health expenditure.
Of these, 46% fell as regards maternity leave, as well as occupational accidents and 54% as regards sickness leave, which amounted to 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted an average of 14.5 days in 2009 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average of some differences: another, in 2007, published by Monster.com, a site for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 respondents, French workers, said they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study recorded this time by the health insurance revealed that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
So, compared to their European neighbours, the French workers are no longer prone to inability to work elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers from the French State Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of absence (founded by disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France and 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in disease reports is a very low share of the black work.
With regard to the occupation, only a weak ausmav is reached here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for training and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 of the implemented short-term sickness reports, which was in 37,050 cases "unjustified or too long".
In the case of systematicly controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days, among 1.2 million, 11% of cases were "unjustified or unjustified", which amounted to 132.000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have made a health report valid.
A figure representing only a weak scale compared to, for example, that of black work.
According to the UMP, Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defrayation in the last name.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to tackle its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, adding the fact that his government did not spend hundreds of days in the Union to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the Head of Government said in his first public speech in the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the euro area decisions taken on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the Eurozone "is at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit by 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his consent to the approved adoptions in respect of an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but provided that his party would not be prepared to make an additional withdrawal.
"We will not vote for new elections," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary meeting of his party's New Democracy.
However, he was prepared to explain with regard to the budget deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, a trusted EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan over 8 billion euros without the written guarantee of all parties on their support for the planned acquisitions, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under the pressure of Auves.
Euthanasia and accompanied freedom must be legalized, such as an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as emerges from a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on painkiller treatment to provide the best painkillers, and this went beyond cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians are able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in order to allow accompanied Suizid and Euthanasia to take such a decision where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to do so.
The experts quoted a recently published survey of the independent EIU society, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself here on the 10th grade, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting down on the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painful resources, so tell us the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of those in the hospital die.
In all countries, the rate of death in Quebec is the highest with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
In the issue of euthanasia and accompanied Switzerland, the authors of the report are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already taken up no amendments to the criminal law on Euthanasia and accompanied Switzerland.
However, there is no evidence, according to the experts who have similarly inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalized Euthanasia and accompanied Switzerland, that such decriminalization would lead to abuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied Switzerland by unqualified or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations in countries where Euthanasia and associated Switzerland are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signor of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasis is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied by Suizid is practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Support Euthanasia
We are aware that according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already drowned in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe it allowed people at the end of their way of life to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the practice of legalizing euthanasia does not have the effect of conveying the message that the life of older or disabled people is of less value.
With regard to persons who have already practiced a accompanied Switzerland, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintaining or setting up the funds in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, so the authors of the report.
They also point out in their recommendation list that the criminal law should specify that the suspension of the funds for which a legitimate refusal has been lodged should not be regarded as criminal.
In addition, the expert body calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting an end-of-life suspension, and must fear this without criminal prosecution.
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated on painkiller treatment in order to provide the best painkillers, and this went beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to the funds already used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the Board calls on them to take into account, at least as little as the Euthanasias served to reduce physical pain and to deal with the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the area of health have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the attitude of reporting experts as "extreme" among other things, since they do not set any limits on euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is pregnant and older than 18 years of age is asking another person to be helpful to him in his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deshamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values that are involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "Pro-Euthanasis-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is in particular in doubt about the reporting of non-absorbing abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated Switzerland are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to join power.
Damascus requires a "compact"
Syria is more insulated
The partisans Baschar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auven Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bashar al-Assad, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "complet" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the removal of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the former Arab Prime Minister, President Bashar al-Assad had called for "to put down his power in Syria", where about forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Baschar had the interest of his country in his heart, he would have withdrawn, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had complained that since the beginning of the year, Turkish mediation attempts had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he said in a statement on Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is constantly taking a more and more harsh attitude.
The United States, on the other hand, has examined the "enhancing of the consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in the face of the repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in the city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Auvene Trade Minister Walid al-Mulim was nevertheless the view that the country "taxed at the end of the crisis".
He also stressed the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which reflected his assessment of a "hazardous step".
He added, "If Syria were not to comply", adding, "the plots against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Auvene Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of the sending of UN observers to protect himself from the regime's repressions that he was encapsulated into his "Paranoia".
A new summit of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on 2 November on the rise of the crisis, but in particular the controversial, predictable withdrawal of the military troops from the occupied cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Auvene Minister Sergei Lawrow made the decision of the Arab League 'incorrect' yesterday in order to protect himself from any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets to be patient and Italy to be prepared for sacrifice
Mario Monti, a future Italian government leader, has asked the markets for a little more time to form his staff and implement a programme to demand "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a debate with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to invite a cabinet to Parliament, which consists of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, on the other hand, agreed to put Mario Monti to Parliament by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The talks will take place in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of strikers, which will undoubtedly be rich from a dozen ministers to head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the tight nervousness of stock exchanges and bonds markets required their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will be clear and understanding".
His order by the President was examined by the markets, but the unrest had intensified, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The Acting Prime Minister was intended to establish a staff composed of major technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, so it was estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should be given a certificate of trust by Parliament until Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself since taking up his role to work in all the urgency of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
One speaker from Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis against the Italian economy has not changed even in the light of the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013 despite the savings plans that have taken place in recent months, has applied for new sharp cuts.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of the heads of Italy, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, is also aware of the need for economic convergence, as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit figures".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "responsibility challenge" as well as another "Italy", so the lead authors.
The gross unknown was the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections, as from now until April 2012 Italy has to pay 200 billion euros for state bonds.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-enabled spruce, so on Monday, a US NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety of IAEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA had announced its "resolved concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents from ISIS, the Danilenko born in 1934 had evidently worked in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produced the "Nano Diamonds".
His company's economic difficulties had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who has not only been highly modified in this technique, but also, as a member of the Agency reported, has worked directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin in an essential way to this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
From 2009 to 2010, the crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by 50%, while other racial or religiously motivated violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday either slightly decreased or only slightly increased.
According to this data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 was 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hass motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak Mave, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, so the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes again growing," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," Paul Legendre, an organization responsible, added.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these violations," he added, considering that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards the "haast" crime.
The "Hass crimes" is in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther Kings' death to punish violent people who are directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and are now also involved in crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes the platform and likes more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform in order to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "name" allow better reader-friendly live reflections of the activities of other "twitters", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") are persecuted and who follow your messages.
This allows us to determine whether they allow us to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August at a low percentage of users", Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its few instinctives Functioning, it comes with something esoteric anmutendem Wordlaut (RT to the referenced repetition of the contributions of another person). follow-friday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiés, so opens a wider audience with a more comparable handling of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" over the Internet.
"It is useless, urgent and equal to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me to better track certain elements of my flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Austrian Government of the Great Socialist/Christian Democratic Coalition decided to include a "Golden Budget rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid possible degradation of rating agencies in the Austrian top-bonitation (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria was 74.6%, so far above the criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, 60%, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not been reduced to AAA on AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in interest every year," Michael Spindeleger, Vice-Chairman and Christian Democratic Minister argued.
Austria also requests the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone from 26 October: the Heads of State and Government at that time would have required the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
As Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule" in the Constitution, the adoption by the Austrian Government of the 'German model' is similar to that of the 'German model'.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the Federal State should not exceed the 0.35% GDP threshold, whereas the regional countries should have the same budgets as the municipalities.
The objective is to reduce budgetary debt in the Horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would reinterpret on the monetary markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"If we were to place an excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was in close proximity to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced on 31 October to intervene.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which has been spending a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has regularly increased over this, dwindled by the purchase of investors, who view Yen as a "flight value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has been used under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had affected the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was recorded by 120 yen, the euro over 160 yen.
This beam fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the Archipelago, as it consumes the costs of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income derived from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in foreign currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11th, which devastated the Tohoku region (Northeastern) for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who fears that this tying of Yen could kill the weak rise already in the chemistry.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the exploding export gains and consumption of the "lumbbed" households.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the tenure of the yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
On the other hand, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to take all earthly measures to eliminate the yen, which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has, however, been aware of this, that BoJ has already initiated "appropriate acquisitions" in order to make it clear that there is no additional currency lockdown on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting, at the end of October, the Bank of Notenbank had increased its public debt purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) that it had spent on various purchases of financial assets to exceed the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast in height, exchange make return
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly determining the European identity numbers.
Despite the recruitment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
The exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also run this Tuesday, November 15th, a little more in negative direction.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions with regard to the return on public bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their short-term profits.
"The investors are nervous and only aware of the risk of accumulation," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which, in turn, in the renewed fear of market participants in terms of the capacity in Europe, suffers that the debt crisis continues, has closed with a 0.7% share.
"Japan has focused its eyes on Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade moves towards a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone is damaging the unitary currency that continues to be based on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for about half a month.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it remained 0.4%.
According to the stock exchangers, they withdrew after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had made an application, which in particular provides for the possibility of leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The interest rates of Italy and Spain continue to be at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85%, the Spanish title reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti asked for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt relief.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions of the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, since on Sunday Parliament elections take place in the country.
The interest share ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old bonds has again reached a new historical high.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
Statistics show France's economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the basis of the figures of the second quarter, with a negative of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most economic experts worry about.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first calculation of the entire Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a re-retirement.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate to hold a meeting on the occasion of this issue and to reflect on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it investigates the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a duplication of electricity demand by 2050, it is not necessary to ignore a huge proportion of the world's population as a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate problems.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refuse nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitute source of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
In order to name only a few states, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided to join its park by re-launching the Three Mile Island plant that was closed after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model is sometimes set as an example, the reality of renewable energy sources, however, contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will result in a deterioration of the electricity price, an increase in energy dependence on imports, particularly from Russia, resulting in an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for thought.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European wind energy table driver, with 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, which is used in contrast with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness as well as the stability of the industry at national level, the French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would read the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Investigations showed that the price that the gross majority of French people are willing to pay is as little as possible to identify their resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are faced with the fact that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial hub with 125.00 direct and 410,000 incentivised jobs.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them a number of jobs to be created.
If France had decided to rise from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would have fallen to the victim, and the EUR 6 billion of annual investment and nuclear energy exports would have collapsed more and more.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to function for six years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must agree that there is as little a miracle as a devil's work to produce electricity.
The solutions developed by Areva, CO2 poor solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
The maximum level of safety to be maintained is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have carried out a security authority that has been able to carry out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made themselves a name because of their professionalism, are to be seized by the security presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disasters.
Only one, although in Three Mile Island, came under normal operating conditions, so he left without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was defeated by reactor construction as well as innocent human defeats.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it had done in the past.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
As it is considered desirable among the electric technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction site in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free railways to travel the leadership position in the unrivalled nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy building for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country as well.
Is Immigration Last or Chance for the Economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised for a number of angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a number of policies, the compatibility of these policies with the status of a "human rights country", as France itself had.
Recently, the government-oriented harassment against foreign students had marked the weekly sights, the Interior Minister had recently announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talent, Maureer or Kellner from abroad".
But this policy was only rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
This is the subject of a broad consensus between the right and the left.
On the right hand, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", said Michel Rocard on the left hand, who indicated in 1990 that France "could not take up the whole of the world's poverty".
The only difference exists in the degree of pregnancy
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Hord of Polish Klempner was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were seen as a burden to the economy and to the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greed that immigrants are willing to face.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, limited itself to banalities that indicate partnership development, allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work, which summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration ( Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus amongst the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Restricting immigration would lead to growth and damage to the labour market situation.
Concerns about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace domestic workers, especially those who are less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
The experience shows, however, that immigrants are in reality much more complementary than domestic workers, since they are heavily involved in sectors which are technically unemployed.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where domestic workers travel less, which are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not available to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where a lack of anesthesiists prevails, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wage and domestic labour market growth between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows leads to a significant long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this is not to take into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is acceptable (higher proportion of immigrants among American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute directly to social systems, in European countries, on average, about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person from 30 years of age to Germany will, on average, provide the public budget with a net contribution (income less expenditure) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to carry out the missing interfaces "with the teeth" at the start of his term of office.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants should fear, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, and now it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had left France in Spain, Salazars in Portugal, and the ruler of Greece over himself, the tragedy of World War I, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulf.
Some would have believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy obsessively over their enemies for all time.
You know from Napoleon "the little one", that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which represents the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also be well expressed as the "depressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, education, enlightenment, economic and social community, a legal process.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a very, very tiring political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change of mind of the Greek True-False Reference would have had a double degree of absolute character: once the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inability to draw.
This ambivalentity should be considered as an overriding concern.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have fallen today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which has been organised depending on the needs and traffic patterns.
A freelance for the European single ruler or a linked eye jump into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, with full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows no more where to end the census - because there is only one crisis, and it reigns in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is committed to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is losing its sovereignty at all times, and thus each of the nations involved in it.
The urgency is to give people sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to hand.
It is up to the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to move forward with investment.
The rise in the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without being sure to lead us into ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought for a long time, everyone today is pressing for the European economic leadership.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it bids the citizens - would be a new mess and another gas.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it is necessary to "make Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This training remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a political and democratic Europe, a truly European peoples' sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chips cards become the general good
The world fair for Chipcards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
In 2011, according to Eurosmart, a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM cards) was expected to end with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or comparison of purchases by simply keeping the card on a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million contactless chips should be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and over 10% of the global chip map market (6,925 million cards).
Europe will win in terms of contact-free payments on the ground after a long delay in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the initials are modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
It is now necessary for banks to provide their customers with these cards to move to a higher speed.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to providing their customers with systematic bank cards in the future that are equipped with contactless chips," Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
A declining percentage of devices is still equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But at least next year they should experience a real development."
"We are counting in 2012 on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will take place from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Generale had said yesterday to prepare the introduction of an offer that allows their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front is understood from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria has now reached "Sureness".
"The way in which both organizations and the relations of the secret services demonstrate clear cooperation," he explained without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigations on the withdrawal of two Frenchmen in Niger in last January have promoted interfaces for days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to be killed on the following day at the same time as several of their exporters on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the drums at the site of use several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorism
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several conversational partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in the numbers of two interview partners in particular: a number leads to a Nigerian who had stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the rampart of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is in close proximity to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there must be no doubt more clear evidence before you can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, however."
"I have known for years that the sect has been engaged in financial and intellectual support of Auven and that it is becoming increasingly active," explains Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly apparent in their course, as well as the responses and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the raising of suicide killers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been pressuring Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminati for a long time, which should not be given particular attention.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emigrate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this medium-term region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It is politicizing and demanding strict compliance with the Sharia, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visionary.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their attacks on the Commission's Office.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as common as indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, including 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in prison, will be killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its castles in the north.
Last Christmas, she was known as an attacker in Jos, who claimed 80 lives, so to another in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram will be blamed for a suicide warrant, which occurred in the secure police station in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is geared towards the leading international target disc.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, has concerned all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria about Boko Harem and was willing to give all the information.
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and Israel's assistance.
Can a crisis-weak America have a complex world with easy to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days now, in the midst of Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-rapporteurs, and their states with regard to Auve policy, a traditional Republican focus, they have repeatedly made their statements.
About China, Iran and Israel's help fall - often in no way undermined - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party, in the middle of the course, Romney threatened to quote the Chinese from the WTO and to address them as the "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America - that is to say, by the emigration of all industrial routes to Asia at the top.
Stupidly running, if this is supposed to involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have a well-defined vision of Auven politics, almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions that made fun of him.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive conversation with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obamas).
But Huntsman will not be heard as he stagnates into the depths of the questions of opinion.

Romney also had a military battle against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I offer Iran content," he said.
"Berd Obama re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel reinforced military aid, and Obama claimed to be guilty of this partner's obligations.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, is, on the other hand, wearing a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat to counter as Beijing "try to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to me that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is too willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 refusal to respond to torture against mute terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry as well as by Michele Bachmann's candidacy.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an Aubenpolit weight.
The current presidential opponents rejected, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama was also an amateur himself and had to give water in his wine, which affected the topic of anti-terrorism.
They are right on the wrong side of his naive bickering with Iran, the early withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enmity is not so uncompromising.
The population appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been protecting herself from military interventions that lead to the dawn.
And Obama is surprised by his argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to raise its leadership to a new life.
North Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed and connects western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It is to deliver gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to do this event with glanz and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four heads of state and government, have spent the last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestral slamming and at the fine taste buffet of the dedication of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch official, Mark Rutte, have symbolically combined the valve's tax, which drives Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gases per year are to be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already apply the possibility of building a third line on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this huge construction works is like a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any transit through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the ground.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close the accession to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not allowed to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the subject has been seen politically too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This is, however, at the cost of the decommissioning of European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have a strong gas consumption and whose gas presence is changing.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon in the adoption of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the gross gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gas-prom manager represented in Lubmin with regard to the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It runs on the sea floor, in about 200 m deep.
During its construction, data mining fields from the Second World War had to be developed.
"Approximately one hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, enhanced measures were to be taken to protect the Fauna and Flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by any length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided for in front of the Swedish coast, but the project managers took a step away from it, as the Swedishs were unlikely to expect a Russian state company to sit on their coasts in a permanent manner.
"In the case of a Havary, we close the gas pipeline in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline is thus in the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be only unlikely, as the swivel nose was estimated to be a resistance of a leak for 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot controlled for external observation by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, has a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to be subjected to the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are included (any to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas industry and the French group GDF Suez (any to 9%).
These five companies formed a company called Nord Stream, which is commissioned by the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom thus rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a two-year extension contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the overall capacity, no matter how gross the real transporting amount of gas disappears," Jens Müller pointed out.
The financing of the gas pipeline was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are committed to reinstate their exposure, since Gazprom bears the risk of liability alone.
The gas line meets a sandy coastal line with pine trees in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gasustritsfort.
Sensors shall measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the gas in question before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand-new book.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give new style to write again.
It has a flair of adventures, with a candlelight with writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the egg-scaling-coloured pages, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, which has its seat in Milan, decided to place a distinctive design note on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant of the company, is commissioned with the introduction of the new product.
The note was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshuut), which is called a cotton lacquer, which is used for example for the purposes of poles.
This type of notebook was very much asked by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible at Mode Mode.
Success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyers, since the memobook is also entertaining business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals like Fnac, in small boutiques of the city center and intends to carry out its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the rise of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: The brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Overway)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
On the occasion of the film festival in Locarno in August, the company also placed a link with Leoparden patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood it to diversify his products: pockets, calendars, fillers, computer holes... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that leads to a decline: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased from the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntegra Capital, and thus opened up a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouragement?
"No, that's how Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adaptive Association, points out that the "week of work for the disabled" is.
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not doubled, but three times so high."
"There's still a lot to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
The elderly are more often affected: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no qualifications and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-engage, and that create the "core of the problem", said Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based association that is helpful to companies.
So much for the real brakes.
The unprovoked one, the mental attitudes that are certain to develop, but slowly develop.
A study carried out in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge about disabled people", the "overrepresented" was "by people in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a broad way to achieve the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last-mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that did not consider this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially of the gross corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs between 20 and 49 employees are disabled, companies with 100 to 199 employees, on the other hand 82%.
Hazard: "What for a Happiness"
Before they offered the "Blue Service Days (20:45) the stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not spared their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game.
It would have gone too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bonds.
On the side of the view podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been well and happy to close peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had not earned anything as a praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the noble liller on his side.
As for the contrast between his performance at the club and the National Self, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I've been in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come after Saint-Denis, released against Romania on the match against France in order to "finally shine".
However, without leaving the note of "gloriousness".
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7 years, leading its victorious troops between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We've just been on our way."
"To be able to play them means great luck!"
On the other hand, reading read read with kindness "stolz".
"The pride, a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbourly" - that France "has become a team at a very high level" and that this is little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium is going to fail in the next European championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French National Elf) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out rough," he stressed.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal very reliable
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, sees the back game against Bosnia (2:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the case of the two teams, the skill had failed.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selectçao" will qualify for the 2012 European Championship, his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and to serve a opponent, and that's Bosnia.
Considering the example (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes are not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated over more than an hour clearly the party, but the team was unable to push the thing out of the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which presents a certain risk, because we have not achieved an external shock."
However, home, in its bright city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they should be beaten in front of a public who should also be in the game, even if the party was declared "very little", the optimistic but clear bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but they are completely convinced that they can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
On Friday in Bosnia, the Portuguese are forced to reach and win a gate.
An inconsistencies can already be enough for the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, which presents a certain risk, because we have not achieved an external shock," says Bento.
"We are being attacked by a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already begun to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "give no time to think."
A good idea, provided it is implemented this time.
