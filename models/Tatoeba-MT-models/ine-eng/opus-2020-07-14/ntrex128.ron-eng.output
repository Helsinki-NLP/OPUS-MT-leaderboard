The members of the National Assembly of the Netherlands are concerned that they may feel that they are "marioned"
Several members of the National Assembly of the Galos are constricted because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of the Galos Country).
This problem has been caused by the plans to change the name of the meeting within the Gale Country Parliament.
The members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political stage are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that it "removes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside the Netherlands: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Galos Party of the National Assembly of Galos said that the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternative.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that he also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the Gala country as the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name change, said: "The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend even on those members."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, which made it clear that many of them wish to use the "Parliament of the Netherlands".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of the Netherlands, the Commission preferred "members of Parliament of the Netherlands" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received most votes in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales suggested alternative options, but attempting to reach a consensus could lead to Elin Jones, the chairman of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the draft law on amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word in terms of their title when the law is being debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province, Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim about its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's EU and NATO membership .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change of name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bishops of St. Martin's church stopped beating as a result of the problems that the churches in Harlem face.
"In historical terms, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are neither bars nor churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing otherwise today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually stretch."
And with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent more quickly than the leaders expected and that, " sooner or later, the delay will be the same".
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condoms filled with people who would not support the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the closing of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condoms will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by white - colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African - American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, after a decade.
The original Methodist Congregation, formed of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, who carried out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
Church of St. Martin was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for purchases from Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but the proud parents Johnson made plans to rebuild it and included the caravan in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father's son Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin, named the charilon "the clopoies of the poor".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural fair" and "a historical instrument of unreplaced importance".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, further stated that it was the first carilon in the world acting by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed on to a larger carilon, to the Riverside church, 18 years ago.
Merryweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard by St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others of episcopal diocese.
The priest, the government of the parish, formed of deacons, wrote diocese in July to complain that the diocese "was seeking to pass the costs" to the priest, even though it was not involved in the engagement of the architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some of the fans complained about the lack of transparency that proved diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the post KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, with his friends, on Saturday morning, when he heard a boy screaming for help and that he then moved along from a group that helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that, initially, he thought the boy was pleased that he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that the scream "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire key was finished, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I screamed at all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles has mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Teller Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty products and fashion in the UK
Sainsbury preia Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, making available regions with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a position-building in the UK’s beauty products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion products sales are not in measure, the largest beauty products regions will be tested in 11 country stores and will be integrated into several magazines next year, if they prove to be successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of which supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the retailer Sainsbury said that the number of beauty products he offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also reopens its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a growing demand among young buyers.
In addition, products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the retailer Sainsbury, said that the outlets will increasingly appear as universal stores, as supermarket chains are trying to cope with the struggle with large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales and increased profit.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reinstate its pharmaceutical and pre-flavouring compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a difference on how to share Boots' revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, Celesio's company, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four magazines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, retailer director of Sainsbury, said: “I have transformed the appearance of our regions with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations turn us into an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds sterling.
The protagonist of the TV "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is angry after the presentation of the TV Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his life-style company, to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to involve in their project concerning Truly brand, which includes accessories and home-use items.
The couple's company was compared to Goop's brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presentation of the “This Morning” show, 37 years old, announced to Instagram that it would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the leading player of the "Dragons' Den" show, in the final moment of their business that offers life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when one of the most in love with people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense sitting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds sterling, no longer allow them to dedicate their brands, True, which includes access and home use objects.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's property, with estimated value of 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, at the age of 37, announced Instagram that he would give up the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities far away.
She had to be her future in the long run for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday, it was less until the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's office that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the present issue "This Morning", which is among the best sold in Britain, could lead to millions of damage to the company, as a result of investments in products such as feathers and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible additional delay in launching.
It can also represent the end of a distant friend.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand bases together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, at the age of 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the Ambassador of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the "I'm A Celebrity" show from the ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider to be "renderable to a president" and that he had such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump was imitating a voice as a "presenter of news".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denouncing North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
At the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "responsibility" from the United States regarding the former nuclear-delaying regimes of North Korea.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on that point.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"All goes well with North Korea," he said.
"Urma to go towards a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning US troops.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but if I were to act like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this uncovered arena, it would be around 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the majority in front of him.
A tsunami and a storm in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of people to die
According to the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their help is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a necessary condition for the launch of international aid actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save the Children" Foundation is trying to train a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed to access the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said that the authorities in Indonesia evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the relief efforts.
In view of Indonesia’s constant shocks, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be inadequately prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not often met on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this more complicated.
A hospital that has settled in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed improving the security infrastructure in Indonesia to be the central point of his election campaign and allocated funds for roads and railways.
But lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressures from the Indonesian sectarians, as the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, because the bands of Christians and Muslims were on the streets, using swords, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the rescue goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in 89, on Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.

The mine reached above which, facing to the corner of the right of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed from Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
"I should just try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, just, I took the ball away."
Chelsea drove 1-0 on a break after Belgian star Eden Hazard marked in 25 minutes.
The blue team's attack sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the ground and ran to half the Liverpool team's ground.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the ground.
Then he sent Hazard's ring, which came in.
Hazard went beyond the defense and sent the ball into the field, able to hit it with his left foot and get past the player Alison Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team in the League of Champions leagues at 15:00, at Stadio Sao Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday at 15:00 in London.

Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the alterations on "historic writing"
The removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban of all the cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a fool" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The English Civil Wars Iconoclass was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for his uncle Thomas's actions in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and a part of the story of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith stated for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
However, the conflict since the mid-19th century has certainly led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only by the name of the family ‘Yuan’, was found dead after he was scutted and covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, according to the Sunday editor of the Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs vaccines into a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he came with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
She said there's a pig in the container the male of large blood sizes in the mouth.
Legal doctors have confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and blood," said the cousin, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A representative of the market said for Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police pulled evidence from the scene of the crime.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported that have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig of 300 kg, a man in the Netherlands was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and take the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions."
‘It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them due respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who lost her intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As foretold, the Rosa hurricane is losing its intensity as it moves to the most recent waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the next days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressing area has begun to form across the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, months, in the form of tropical storm, will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rains in the south-west in the next days.
Local, precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste streams and possibly desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of between 5 and 10 cm are expected in the south-west part, especially in most of Arizona.
It is possible to have rapid floods due to rapid deterioration due to the nature of the tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture in the desert below, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
The mighty rain could cause the canyons to become violent rivers, and the storms would bring local winds to the reefs and dust.
The depressing area approaching will bring torrential rains to the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of approximately 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor flows of waste and ale-coast roads.
These will be the first precipitation in the region in the wet season.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of the Sunday day and in the first part of the month, before the rain spreads more Mondays and Tuesdays.
The intense precipitations will spread in the so-called "four corners" Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes will occur in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the central U.S. area level.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern US will face a hot start of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from south to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a great chance of temperatures above average for the US by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault, which is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-hour news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation by the FBI over a week.
Ford told the jury that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had pregnant her while she was in a state of drunkenness and that he had tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense witness, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have been followed up on Friday's hearing.
The company included the average vision of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble concurring people who see from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose audiences strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, it was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
The ABC was located in the second place, with a number of viewers of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was tracked by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
The interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was in the center of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS chambers Friday morning while the protestors called on him and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a sitting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were fighting him, and everything was broadcast directly to the CNN.
"I'm right here, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You are powerful, while so many women are incapacitated."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote directly within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he'd only do this if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, a request for minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of the discussions with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
The election of Flake was an important one, as it is clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accused Critics of "political Games" About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that is next to his photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on his plan for Brexit, so-called Chequers Plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the European Union collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arresting Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in case of the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player at the age of 20.
Diteon Simpson, aged 20 and over, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the filming of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the meeting.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated to CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say she confessed to killing Wayde.
His claim was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medical Office Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, saying death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department deserves the Louisiana police force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area, for the aid provided for, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "dignifying and looking for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attack with a height of 1.98 m grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "damaged" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The ashes from the Volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern areas of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep the distance from the volcano after the event was launched in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded over 24 hours.
The center monitors several uruts and vibrations.
The images on the socialization networks presented thin layers of ashes on car parks in the streets of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake swept the Mexican center in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Integrating between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protestors met with Jandarmies, at the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, forcing thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separators kept far away from jendarms bombed those with eggs and powdered cows, creating clouds dark of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
Intensification was later intensified, the police using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups called "Don't forget, we don't forgive," while union Protestants called "Living Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen, in a comprehensive majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote has been reduced, and those against the secession have boycotted, largely, the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the polling centres in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we don't have what to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital victory, but narrowly, in the regional elections in December last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties have tried to maintain the prosperity of this year, many of the most well-known leaders, either in exile or in detention, awaiting the trial for the role of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after entering a house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged at the door level and even at the building.
It seems that at a given time, an ornate was used against the car.
Menga's strike helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingstone left the Rangers unrepeated team, Steven Gerrard getting to the second defeat in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second replay.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League in this season and confronts Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unwinding in the division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the pleasure of defeating because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the Crown visitors
Holt's team would have had to advance a long time before registering, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cross and tried to land on the gate, then Alan Lithgow managed to land long after he entered the landing to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halket's head.
The guests were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for the visitors at the free hits.
And it was the way the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free strike, and Livingstone managed to open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to pass on to Menga, who shot and marked out of the center.
At that stage, Rangers dominated possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and Liam Kelly's porter was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second replay, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't make it against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgov gave a long shot from another liveston team player.
The diagonal passages continued to come into which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two demands of penalty - after Halkett blew Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Femenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward path.
Their game style and team haven't changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for how he trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organised defense, while Menga made it difficult for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they succeeded only once to catch the port of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the class.
Joint reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to take breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO alliances.
These are not satisfied because of problems such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, most Kursi, heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with open arms in the country.
The contradiction protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died in front of the scene.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured following a blackout
Six prison officials were injured following an inmate to a high-security prison for men, a representative of the prison said.
Sunday, a meeting was held at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9:30, this being under way.
Specialized officers have been brought to take care of the crew, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in an arip.
Officials were treated on the spot for minor injuries on the front.
A spokesman for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after they were injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules about the officers, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after the gratis."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, officials dealing with disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (the drought zones can enjoy the benefits of this thing)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month she will cause a rush.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a Twitter message that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Uragane predict precipitates between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim from Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Stâncoşi and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in certain areas, the torrential rain will be beneficial because the south-west is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Secte Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona is faced with at least one severe secet, the second largest category", information on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to field landings in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, with 19 km per hour.
The oven will meet fresher water in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce land dumps in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
The torrential rivers in Mexico could be significant, presenting a risk of high flooding.
"The torrential rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the north-west of Sonorei, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south of Utah on the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, the north-west of Sonore and the South-West of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Uruguay.
These rains are expected to produce sharp floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams into the deserts, as well as land wells in the mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area tonight, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officials have asked for the help of citizens who might have material on the mobile phone, and then to submit to the police department.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "empowerment and mania" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the "empowerment and hand" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Joi, Kavanaugh testified to Congress, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's statements about having sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the sitting on her statement.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lies in the legal field of this generation," he told the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but, in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my full positive opinion on the candidates I consider to be extraordinary."
Trump argued that democracies are in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is anticipated that the first procedural vote to the Senate since the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place on Friday, a GOP driver for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesia's earthquake, the number is growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people were held Friday at a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said at a Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami has brought cars, trucks, houses, hitting everything that is on the desert," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami has travelled at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
It added that some people were forced to rise into trees to escape tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and stores, torn and broken bridges, as well as a pool surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to wake up the coastal town.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said that the energy emitted by the strong winter earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Atomic Bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
It is likely that the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, intensified the volume of the tsunami, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and pests could be larger than the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" in Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get hurt."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized because it did not inform about the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the positions of socialization networks, you can hear a man at the top of a building shouting brake warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the ground, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declared, but the evacuated people still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are placed in improvised shelters in the office's court, they passed the devastating scene, said Doseba.
She added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed. ”
The situation is very serious.
Even though the aid groups have begun to remain in the event of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia regulations, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only reach the place of production of a disaster if declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government will say, 'Yes, this is a national disaster', we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.
After the second night from the earthquake and tsunami of Fridays in Palu, the friends and families of the deceased hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a channel.
Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who was in ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to this.
Gendon Subandoro, coach of the national parachute team, trained for the Asia Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parachute pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of parachute activity, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel in the community of sports practitioners with parapanta, he sent desperate messages to whatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in his right message there was only one grey birch, and not two blue birchs.
"I think that means that the messages were not transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a banker from Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, cars stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who fed a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "runs through the back of the Brink" and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the report, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport police at the phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his scene name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his scene name to "Ye".
It made a Saturday announcement about Twitter change: "the person known as the Kanye West."
The West, at the age of 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for emotional reasons", the producer mentioned the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current name of the scene, West stated earlier that this word also has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly met word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, in the discussion about the title of the album with the head of the Big Boy radio.
"Because I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it reached "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, bad, nebula and everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He's one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his scene name.
Sean Combs had countless scene names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cream, sometimes without, as well as with large letters.
Mexico's President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as soon as the country's 50th anniversary of a bloodthirsty reprisal against the students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops led a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were reduced to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has undertaken to support Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He said that the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for the IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come as soon as more US government members have made announcements about the IA, even if there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first in terms of IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubleding the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far more behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the chances of the next major IA performance being done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's leading companies, Face +.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat American player Othello, which was the best in the field at that time and was later executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the following visions.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government funds, Lee said.
"China doesn't put drinks in the hands of academic leaders, but corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US intensify its IA efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in the IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the New Art Intelligence Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people from similar academic institutions in how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
NSF also now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in the legislation of the United States aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wish the country's name to be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the new proposed name, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycotting campaign was doubtful as to the voting presence, as it could not reach a minimum limit of 50% necessary for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the ballot to the referendum will be: "Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the desolation of Yugoslavia, in order to be able to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the names to be changed, a quorum of two-thirds is necessary in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of those with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, a Skopje voter, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of name of Macedonia, allowing them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small-sized scene and took a seat in front of the high courts of those who will boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said accession to NATO will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after expressing his vote.
He said that a result of the change of name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious strike at the level of the pro-vec government policy since the government's adoption in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to go through the entire Brighton team's defense and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were able to go to Brighton's defense team and win Manchester City on Saturday with 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero's was incredibly easy to walk in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack took place in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton, before he got to the free part of the ground.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he passed over more warning players on the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he took a turn left, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attack sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, trying to avoid the porter from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few problems on his feet," told reporters Pep Guardiola, team manager Manchester City.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a goal at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for Azuri in the game of the Premier League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a deep passage on the Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he took a look at Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane blew the balloon a few times until she sent a passport to Sterling, who sent it to the gate.
The Azuri attack hit the balloon to the place just before it went out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, with Hoffenheim in the group phase, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the ravages in the match against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the competition in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in the game-off for Rockies, which holds an advantage to the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unpredictable place, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep his first title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point in this year’s time.
Why would I not want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player that will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is intended to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game with number 34, had a heating session Thursday and would throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington Middle House has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ratings in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation of a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh as it dealt with the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
“All our efforts are in the game in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big ones, not candidate, but actually candidate, so I try out of scratches to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "See this horrendous, radical group of Democrats, see what is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power again by using any means necessary, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to grab to get power and control, they want to have power and control, and we won't give it."
It also said that democracies are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "fragile and evil, foolish and liars."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who is part of the Senate Judicial Committee, which was strongly hated by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship movement with regard to me.
Finally, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment, because it was very much about anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion represented a criticism of my address that I didn't agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
As for the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which Jeremy did not share his views with the previous leaders.
The Friday meeting of Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentioned the fact that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evenings were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are not taking place in this way, and the promise of a "better, lighter" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things began to be so when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common view of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things that I had not previously agreed on, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the de-socialization networks that require my removal from the party, denouncing the central policy, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Actually, I know I'm happier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination I give my colleagues to face a sexual or racist abuse, but I keep their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have recommended that I put my head down in the last two years, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labourist Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the neglect that the Thatcher government has shown has led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my opinions on politics and the issues that I do not agree with regarding the current leadership are negotiable.
People who have supported Friday's motion can only say that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, what will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not I am a member of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be of your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the classes
Despite the fact that two late attempts have influenced in some way the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive match today from Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything was summed up in their better defense, as well as in the fact that they benefited more from the opportunities, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests on our matches so far and we continue to be innocent, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The medals are given to the Ayr team, they took more chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow cartridge received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot benefited from an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to register, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second one very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to Ruarid Knott's serious injury, which was pulled out of the field with the plate, and since the start of the game, Ayr has been disbanded by trying the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cardboard and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unprocessed trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a completed pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he placed Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to march, offering him the advantage of Air.
Climo transformed the experiment, as he did again almost from the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe had run a box kick movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The "Still Game" website is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, star of the Still Game site, is ready to move into the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC-loving show, writing his script and playing with his partner for a long time, comedy actor Greg Hemfill.
The two have announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, it is the director of the company Afringingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "industry in the development of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a shipyard full of macarales in La Paz.
Public buildings build the blue flag, like the ocean.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Along Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary maturity, a spirit of unity and senate and, of course, expects the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign release to the sea, Bolivia.
Here Morales , the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial battle for the coming year – also has many winnings following the month decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change too little things if it happened.
The United Nations system in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final appeals have been heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not succeeded in causing it, but it is possible for the last four years to have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been distorted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' s belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual charity, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk after this.
The two countries have not changed the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was unusually fast.
On Monday he will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutual disparity," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said his country would never disarm his nuclear weapons if he could not trust Washington.
Ri talked about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect its promises during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic action on nuclear threat after more than three months after a meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
It stated that it is a "real visa" that the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war will ever make the territory of the north surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant steps first.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics who don't think that the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends with regard to decks and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to extend your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagance hats for their Spring 2019 collection.
Practical payouts have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators have sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, realized by Valentino, was an extravagance, bej-coloured hat, with a large boor, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models were melted.
Other top-sized accessories included peppers decorated with margues, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bisque fairs, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored muscles had ribs and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessories, and did not fashion high knives.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sinking equipment, having a oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cone with ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you have luck.
Stylists require a return of huge dolls to luxury fashion stores.
The above-sized garments return after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the paddle hat with a large boor, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the completely practical hat that appeared on all socialization networks caused the appearance of another super-sized creature on the podium, each of the people's pay for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathroom suit that wears it.
Portocalie bag of rafie, with rafie brakes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the Spring Spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus's "La Riviera" at the Fashion Week of Paris
The star stylists, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the hats and beachmen oversized in the luxury shops next summer, because the fashion creator had such a powerful impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level of their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and higher education, chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak his own language, words will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classes, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher degree A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are held as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Commission on employment and skills in 2014 found that 17% of the employees were attributed to a lack of language skills due to the reasons for the fight against job vacancies.
Hence, more and more linguistic skills become imperative for the preparation of young people for their future career.
With many job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a greater chance of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with the teaching framework that are specialized in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the country's future, so that it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well (True).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will make the debut at Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Expectation is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play at the opening of the Sunday press against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will the game remain to be established.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers 6 games program in the press.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare," he said.
Time for the election meeting of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings scheduled next week, which includes stops in places where the electorate is favourable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for the candidate chosen by him for the seat of the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections by mid-term mandate, as the Republics are at risk of losing control over the Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, Virginia de West, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast hour, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can follow Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, a candidate at the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense due to improper sexual behaviour charges, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI will investigate the allegations.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are faced with hard elections in November, to win a little field.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "the energy of volunteers and supporters, while the Republics are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel in as many states as possible before entering the highly crowded campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said to Reuters, who did not want to be named.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's meeting could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits Virginia de West, the state in which he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being investigated.
"The fact that the president came to try to move him in the poll is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple trials that start Sunday
After three clear mastered sessions, it is possible that the foursomes on Saturday afternoon would have been the exact thing Cup Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players actually believe in it, so much more in competitions than this.
So where's their motivation now?
"We were running six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're based on this drop for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points in play.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game is beginning to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage, of which is the most important form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three out of four.
Speeth sent the minions to the green zone with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those Gutular Celebrations became increasingly loud as the progress was moving, especially when he wrote a crucial point by which he re-evaluated the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar ullet, a ullet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry only about your own game," Spieth says.
So much for these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
Singers with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems I can't make a mistake.
Moliwood was the only pair that did not need any additional hit on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid both for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new points of Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to run towards and towards the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would lead to a successful victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different doors.
Discussions on the glory of Europeans remain premature, at the same time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly from Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs test, when she made a pair with Alex Noren.
An additional strike and two doubles at the first nine holes have sunk Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve to be followed closely because of the interactions between pairs, data and nude tips and the way a strategy can be modified on-the-spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this forum session has shown and that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubt.
Europe runs 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it's finished fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning's fourballs trial and won the 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European news that wins four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair named "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pairs that win four of the four opening matches in the entire history of Cupei Ryder.
After they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs' test, they were super-assisted to defeat the downfall of Woods and the American newsmen Bryson Dechambeau with a score even clearer, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional scissors of genius, but so far lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs session, came back with partner Henrik Stenson in a foursome test and faced Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder managed a team to recover a deficit of four points in simple trials, although, because they are the current owners of the trophy, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after being in place the second two days in a row, a Sunday contract seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions will deepen confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the North Korea Global Council that "significant measures have been implemented to prove good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and testing of missiles, dismantling the nuclear testing site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated the family's objections to Washington's opposing resistance to a "exampled" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in a summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was committed to making progress towards a "declaration of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump offered guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end of the Korean War from 1950-1953, but the United States said the Phenian had to give up his nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington has not made requests for the relief of the hard international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The US insists on the option of ‘first denouncing’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coherent way, even objecting to ‘the declaration of the end of war’, Ri said.
"The impression that the sanctions can fend for us is an illusion that only people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
He did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader referred to in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malefic President Trump called Kim a "man-received" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to launch the disarmament process, but pointed out that the work had just begun and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said there is no scheduled period for this and added: "It does not matter whether it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say the Phenian should be compensated by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be effective and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denouncing."
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea from 2006, in an attempt to block the Fund for Nuclear Programmes and the ballistic missiles of the Phenian.
Pompeo met Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that he had made "gangster threats".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to decommissioning a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate meat".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate tables" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students do courses on how to rest enough
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of "macho" that makes them present themselves to learning sessions "all night", energetically with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist found that, often, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even possess the basic concepts of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on learning ability.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, 'Why is this said to me just now, in the last year?'
She told me she was never talking about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced first this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that takes an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents a picture of a room, and students can click on coffee houses, losses, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know we can’t immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says it, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
The sufficient sleep, of a good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes students feel that they are hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to create the course after participating in one of his first courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is acute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for the awakening hour, and to know what the harmful effects of the "blue light" are from electronic screens and LEDs, which may disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal earns Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of displacement depression because Dolly Menga's strike condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to get the first victory to move from the 4-1 game won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authorial leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and uninvited players from Rangers didn't seem at any time able to equalize.
Rangers fell so on the sixth position in the classroom, while Livingston went to the third place behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also deal with other problems, because the Calum Spence cough arbitrator had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown into the hair of the visiting team fans.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot that won easily against Air in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a match with Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot drowned his opponents during the match.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingstone had more efficient use of the mines they had.
It should have been only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass moved Scott Pittman to the defense gate by Allan McGregor, but the middle house missed a very good occasion.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep-fighted strike found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that more hope than trust in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought that he should have received a penalty when he was harassed by Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed only two hits on the gate in the first review, but the former porter on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibally's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the goal of the 34 minute livers at Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, or just for the effort made.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted on a break when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibally; this move almost gave way, when the extreme focused Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the boots to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match she prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted post-centering.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, then Lithgow sent with his head next to the corner gate.
Glenn Middleton, reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty for the end of the game, when he was hit by Jacobs, but again, Thomson didn't agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger office
And now, a page of our Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the numerator continues...), is the day that was born in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger count.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger County has become essential for pop culture, as was the case in the movie "The Clopotes of San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with improbable advances to science:
The man said, "What's this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, there's a lot of noise!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory in such a way that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn them" to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West maintained a Trump's support diet, while wearing a MAGA hat, after the appearance at SNL.
He didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was huddled in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a show that praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, while wearing a Make America Great hat, the artist resigned in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Many times when I'm talking to a white person, I'm asked, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, filming with West Diatra was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to take the West on this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in colleges because of his superiors.
"They tried to intimidate me in the colleges.
They said to me, "Don't come out wearing this hat."
I was attacked!
They've told me I've come down a lot," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how much I have come down?" and then he said, "I'm going to get Superman's blanket, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted audiences from the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed to be shy, Variety reported; a person from this team said to the publication: "A full silence has been found in the studio."
West was invited as a last-hour replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose lover, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of shocks when he played the song I Love dressed it as a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits of us: I'M MULTUMES AS A GLOATA INFUNTA."
Karen Hunter, the owner of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that the West simply "was himself and this is wonderful".
"And I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") about whom I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that he is now "the son officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; the West is walking behind Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into "the earlier known artist as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for an injection into a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer was expected to be in front of the Belfast Court for months.
The allegations will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Urzeala Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of macho hero, saying the presentation of these roles on the screen makes the boys think it has to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something wrong has happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo can be managed.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Thrones Bridge, Rose Leslie, who is only 31 years old, admitted that it is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about it now: where did I fail with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, considering the problem we are dealing with now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing male toxicity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and from the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
'Cause it's clear something wrong happened with the kids.'
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any series based on the Urzeala Thrones after the series ends in the summer of the next year, saying he “ended with the battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will play in a new production of True West play by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a chess player.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series of the Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played in the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple got married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines against HIV, as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous minors" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations on Saturday that a member of his team provided personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were made by analysts and websites of the "right extreme".
"Minions, Lies and Other Miserable Lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The published information included the personal address and phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The briefing took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and presented the information of a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The crew member, whose identity, personal and safety information were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial is angry," Flescher wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
He doesn't have to be a challenger.
He must not question the accused's motives.
It must be calm and calm."
Flescher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the mid-term election, also commented on Twitter.
"Importing, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned “the proper legal authorities and entities regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be responsible in front of the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English again hits: flagless parodys with spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit's associated meanings in any new British film, but this also does not apply to the new film of the series of parades of action films which has as its main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Could this blizzarding satire of how strange we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the blind eye and the rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to destroy everything. The name of the character means, firstly, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the secret agent who, despite his claims at luxury and extravagance, has a little from Clouseau, a drop from Mr. Bean and a knife from that guy who contributed with a single note on Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which left a mess behind.
This last adventure of the EU has one or two beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor's palate hit his coif easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the mood is quite weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, offer comic moments as an ingredient with confidence.
The death seems to address more children than adults and, for me, the tragic adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's dumb movie gags when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies and revealed the identities of British agents under cover, towards the disappearance of the service agent, a pitiful role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis because of the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can with his similar character Teresa May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
Its experts in the field of classified information inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so that an agent found in the reserve must be activated.
This is Johnny English's uncle himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, but also giving lessons about how to be an agent under cover. Here are some nice gags, because English conducts a school-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then met with his time partner, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little crazy.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of the creation of interferences in the Secret Service of the Sale Majesty return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls in the pursuit of a billion-dollar charismatic technology industry that claims to be able to solve the IT problems of the United Kingdom: the Jason Volta puzzle, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough enter into an odise of Burlestic adventures: debossed in waiters, giving fire to a French restaurant in fashion, creates chaos when he scurries on the edge of Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when he tries to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, as a beautiful and colorful film, it seems to be a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other films with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't the British cinematographic industry actually give Rowan Atkinson a role as its talent?
The workers deny that they have plans for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labourist party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party seems to want the company's bosses to benefit from the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) by giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be modified.
The sources say that the idea would be "appropriate" with the party's economic programme, which wants to focus the balance in favour of workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way in which workers can benefit from the change in the economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership stated for The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a suitable aspiration in the approach of the economic recovery party in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall strategy of the industrial party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "The week of work for four days is not a party policy and is not taken into account in the calculation of the party."
The cabinet's Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labourers' conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is decided to take back the power of "no-faced directors" and "profesors" from utility companies.
The Board's plans for the office's cancellation also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions could not recover their shares in full, because the Labour Government could perceive "deductions" due to established offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds to provide 10% of the own capital of private sector firms to employees, who will receive such annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reconsider.
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether the Republican senators could be convinced that he would no longer support the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast Sunday interview, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reconsider.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearing; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, quickly, without mistake."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be buried in a rock.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would need some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that: Brett strongly rejects the accusations," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons named by her have confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars, with a mission as impressive as the elimination of world poverty.
Until the seventh edition, the Festival of Global Citizens will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park Square, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things to help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Global Citizens' Festival when I'm only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organisation says that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or tight.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the UK headquarters of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow up to their full potential", who promised to offer Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition to become only a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the majority during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But like the great movements for civil rights or anti-apartheid that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will sing the event this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval forces for a "block" to exacerbate Russian energy exports, says the Interior Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I'm in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia "knows one thing" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of Nord Stream 2, which will double the capacity of existing conduct at 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin stated that the fierce US opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument that puts pressure on consumers and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industry in Germany (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "serious" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "consider seriously" if he is to run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the headquarters of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our strict rule, and for that it takes a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will think seriously if I apply to the presidential elections."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during his first meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey published Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren's electors do not believe it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk Political University Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of well-known democrats who could run in 2020 are Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome she suffers from at a Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after it crashed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused in a case of domestic violence
"The lightnings through which my own son passed, through which he passed after his return... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the traces of the wounds that our soldiers return with," said the assembled audience at a meeting to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant of the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "will come back a little different, harder, wondering whether there is more respect for what they and their military and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country."
It was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states and Columbia District contests a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from domestic or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a friendly request for care Friday in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union organization initiated in August against federal politics was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons, members of a guest," abused her, but US officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-owned lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a generalized problem with domestic hospitality and violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has annulled a 2014 Council decision on appeals to immigrants who have allowed immigrants without acts attempting to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a restriction violates this principle," he writes in a friendly appeal.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses immigrants' entry affects the US economy, saying it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who were trying to escape the abuse and violence of the guests.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave the country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June when politics announced.
The role of asylum has never been that of solving all the problems people face in the world every day, not even all the serious problems.
Rescue operations lost in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a timer run to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who relieves her baby from suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"The ambulatory brings corpses all the time.
Drinking water is not enough."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flood-free assets, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated in the open air due to strong and continuous replicas.
It has eyes full of tears when she remembers how she felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room from the fifth floor that she shared with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "absorbing" of "advertising advertising"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. of praise for the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to blend in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in a escalating campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in a growing trade war, which involves price increases for imports.
The prices imposed by China as a revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the USA.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing injured US workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a Sunday editorial in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "remains this abuse by publishing advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a advertisement in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression in America and of free press," Branstad writes.
"In return, at the newspaper shed on the street here in Beijing you will find a few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic path, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspaper is about.
Republicans draw female voters before the mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, by several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a reaction, especially by women, during the next half-term election.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"This will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the recent initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (the representative of Arizona) on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker of the progressive group, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors called for "Come November!" while demonstrating on the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue the Kavanaugh nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is not part of the news site.
"People say they were already very large and that is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female indecisive voters from the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not attack the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed charges of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it could be a counteraction if the Republics continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a riot for Republicans," said Michael Steele, president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how it was treated," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group of electoral support for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided with regard to the party that should believe it after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seems to believe it afterwards.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in State or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said that I believe in State or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably lied, or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford vowed in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination at the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs to her when she attended a party while they were students at Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data archives or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, musical libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to the company CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely datad out at once.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Crucea Victoria in World War I is celebrated
The only religious Church of the Anglican Church that won a medal Crucea Victoria as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in its native place after 100 years.
Lieutenant-colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
It was killed by a lunetist four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor of the Great Britain.
A memorial stone was developed on Saturday by his two nephews during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it is "wondered by symbolic" that the stone will be developed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal of Saint-Quentin "with a very nice glass and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he quickly reached the line first and, with a "fiancious good", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked only one barrel of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the detachment weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be equal to him, but it makes me feel bad".
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it is highly honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give it".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they received animated drawings with Peppa Pig, in exchange for
Imagine you stayed up all night following Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, exactly when Gegard Mouusasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, the spectators in the UK were amazed when the transmission was replaced by a Peppa Pig episode.
Some were not thankful because they stayed all night to see the battle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to animated drawing for children as "a kind of stupid joke".
"The government regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of the Belator company, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can be followed by viewers from the UK.
"When I'm thinking about the revolutions, I think we could probably solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen the next time.
We're going to sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We've tried to offer the fans more and we've exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says he's grown feeling that he's less than anyone because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she spoke about the rights of gay people to give them other "sperence".
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he took less of the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the tradition show, will disappear for a few months because of a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "low" because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to gain success.”
He wanted to prove that it was "someone," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of the LGBT campaigns and benefited from the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask several countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
She said she decided to speak because she felt lucky that she could live free, without a trace, and because she wanted to give other "spears".
The triple world champion said that he "was taken by surprise" because he fell in love with a man, American cinematologist Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married Oscar's winning cinematist last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you get through so much to such a freckle age," he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years, he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's going through the same good and bad times.
The two became the parents of a boy in June named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his perspective.
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father's name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to find out if he got tickets for the 2012 London Olympic Games, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "you couldn't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and just after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of a whole life going out in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there's no nicer feeling," he said.
This inspired him also in selected music, Proud by Heather Small, a melody that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still excites him.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mikkelson, out of shape, went to the reserve bank on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seven games in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to go back to a good form so that it won't be an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, another record, has been on the reserve bank of Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been many times for the United States team, the major tournament winner has divided the day between being a major for the team and practicing his beats, hoping he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the right drivers, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain from Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the ground isn't a big enough challenge, in Sunday's new match, Mikkelson will face Francesco Molinari, the mythical champion of the British Open, who joined with the newsmen Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mikkelson's match could prove absolutely crucial to Americans, leading with four points to the entry into the 12 simple matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Fury declared himself confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't say anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on my shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Fame member and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but this happened and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's memory for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which no longer rose to the level of his personal memory.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some tangible benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's smart, it likes to play with players, it's a great guy in the team's vest," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with it, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
Its role is more important, it's not just about the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish started in the 1997 game at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to overcome them with a minimum difference of 141⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember having a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where we could barely win," Bjorn (in the picture) said after pursuing as a 2018 team, who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and now leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my teams, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the top of the race.
Let's get out on the ground and do everything perfect.
The game is not ready until the points have passed on to the table.
We have a goal and it is to win this trophy, it must remain the target.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know and what is expected of us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Glad to see how his players managed a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a different situation.
Individual performances are important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now he leaves their partner behind and has to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at a simple test than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns the last day: he was in the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing one when Europe succeeded in "the Miracol of Medina".
"I remember every word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some fast wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-range matches.
We created the appropriate lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for a simple test.
The new German warship, again delayed
Germany's newest fleet of naval forces should have been operational in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen year by year, due to defective systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the standard ship of the new Class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military speaker.
The vase should have been introduced into the marine forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a strong tuna, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a radar, infrared and low acoustic printing.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; new frigates should be possible to go to missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these last-generation war vessels, which are said to increase Germany's maritime force, will already be old before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 was discussed in the press last year when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marine Military returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the teams of the older crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel has too much weight, which has reduced its performance and limited the military capacity to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000 tons of Rhineland-Pfalz vessel is twice as heavy as the vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the cost of the whole project, including equipment training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an estimated EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest sailors are of special importance in view of the latest warnings that say that the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Military Navy "started to remain without vessels that could be sent to missions".
The official stated that the problem has grown steadily over time, because old vessels have been removed without being replaced with new ones.
It noted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered into service within the Military Marine.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the Lilies
Our research that is carried out on a property in Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how fairies use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these uninvited flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will examine common, pigme, and earded, and waterded flowers from the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the auctions during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of the sounds made by the rings and what species emits certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on conservation of nature for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for mammals and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of the area, and which is the best way to maintain forest parcels for lilys and other associated species.
The lily populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have fallen considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the caves, but also by the loss of the habitat.
And the wind turbines and the public lighting are risks, as are the traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, the lilys are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the capture of the press.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thought very seriously of lilys.
They have ten trained experts, who carry out periodic studies, control the cubes and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization has created the first and only lily reservation in Scotland, on the Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten lily species in Scotland.
Moose manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for the Lilies.
"Here, in Treve, the area is wonderful for the Lilies," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about lilies, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of seeking lilys before carrying out property maintenance work, as simple unintended destruction of a maternal cube could kill up to 400 women and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
The Lilies are protected, and the killing, torture or disturbance of their cubs, as well as the destruction of their cubs, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help him.
He said: "Now we have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how the populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to give a journal in Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will "make an ad" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to refer to the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team were accused of rapeing a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the gold balloon winner said in front of the video camera.
"I want to make a commercial using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get the celebrities by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel on the basis of these accusations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will ask for compensation for “equivalent moral damage with an appropriate amount for the severity of the fact, which is probably one of the more serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped anal, according to the documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after an accident, Ronaldo fell in front of her and told her that she was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that she was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later she accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "defeated by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be humiliated by the public".
A 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the charge, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian youth giant, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "and regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain's Great "would regret forever" if it lost the world's lead in car production after Brexit, said the Business Secretary Greg Clark.
It added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnston, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fix at the time" principle: for the machines manufactured in order to reach 37 minutes' intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border problems could arise which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of funds.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more of the inventory for a day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "accompanied precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today 4 issue.
"The evidence from not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we need to continue to use what was a set of successful supply chains."
Toyota could not specify how long the production would have to be stopped, but warned that large prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the production in the long term and would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience taught me that after the loss, these jobs are no longer coming back."
A spokesman for the government said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "flighted another week", because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the House of White Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's electoral interference, the links between Trump's and Russia's assistance and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about the possibility that Trump would grant the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, circled around Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president by means of Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations.
Trump said "would prefer not" to grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump requested an FBI inquiry for a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, which, again, delayed the vote in plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the press on."
Some reporters would contest this claim: Sanders had no press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Mr. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy against TV reporters, who liked to be in the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to be in the show."
Then, he suggested he'd increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analysed the figures."
"I'll have some more briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this most often and you have noticed that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with the debtors visiting him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president has shown why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre sites, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude for the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of Parliament in Scotland, has sent the letter under the conditions that are less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to bear the costs of requests for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, awaiting decisions in this fall.
However, the UK government has begun to prepare itself more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for leaving the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.

Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a headache
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he had suffered a stroke on Saturday, in the match that his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Master Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"He got to the pipe line and just broke up," Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical preparations and medical staff, on the line, before sitting on a stick and transporting it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/width of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to make five total plates before leaving the match, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will receive a higher stamp tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp judicial tax will be applied to persons who are not tax payers and taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasures are expected to reach 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of stamping on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as is expected to announce today Theresa May.
The exchange will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote, promising houses with more favourable prices and targeting people with large incomes.
The higher stamp tax will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers of taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help the homeless.
Surrataxa, which adds to the current legal rate of stamp, including levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a 3% value.
Treasurer expects this change to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first house.
More prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "great ghosts" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending a large part of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first house.
It accused large construction firms of maintaining high ownership prices as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresei May to give up tax on affordable houses in order to solve the "home problem" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive reforms in the real estate area, including the control of rents and the cessation of uninhabited evacuations.
He also wants to offer the councils greater power as regards the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my first mandate to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying existing problems on the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a very far away, and living in vain is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scottish National Team"
Jack Ross, Sunderland's football team manager, said "the ultimate goal" is to become, at a given time, Scotland's national team manager.
The Scottish, at the age of 42, enjoys the challenge of "renewing" the North-Estic club, which is currently on the 3rd place in the First League, with a difference of three points to the first place.
He moved this summer to the team at the Luminian Stadium after he managed, in the past season, to return the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I got to the national B team and so on," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound of Scotland.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood chasing Scottish matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I'll only have this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as Sunderland Club managers, are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former club manager Alloa Athletic said he has no emotion to be the successor of such sacred names and to such an important club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that worries me and could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a success is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in driving, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the club Alloa come back after he went back to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a crucial moment," he said about taking over the leader of the Alloa club.
“I just thought that my role as manager was more appropriate than the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, as far as stress and pressure are concerned, but I feel that it is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel that it's the best thing I've ever had in my adult life."

The perfect time to drink a beer half is Saturday at 17:30, according to a poll
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in revenue in the British public, but putting more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars have increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues have decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA, who provided business consulting services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than the expected period contributed to a type in July, similar to that in the previous month, when the pubs recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while the restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has decreased and more in July.
The pubs and bars that serve only drinks have made a much bigger profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as restaurants.
Looks like people went out to town just to consume drinks.
The sales of drinks at the level of all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, the representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of sports and social events on scale remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% of the year will add to current cost pressures.
The summer canal can't come at a worse time for food industry operators, and only time will decide whether the most moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official industry standard.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socialization network he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 gymnastics students revealed an increase in Insta's false accounts.
Knowledge increased fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "main" account shown to parents
One of the five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialization network that keeps it hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 gymnastics students revealed a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students have said that they hold a "principal" and "clean" account shown to parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who discovered her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret account wrong, observed the position of a teenager who asked to be “violated”.
According to research carried out by the UK Digital Awareness Company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have acknowledged that they hold secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletes' commission
Elid Doyle was elected as the Director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletics Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field athlete and track in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activities to benefit from the vast experience it has gained at international level in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, Britain and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once they are included in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and can help the way sport activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American Nationality athlete, who won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, has remained invalid after he suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “After a month, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide whether I would recover or to what extent.
It was a Titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement comparing women with cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A blood pumping company has caused public opinion division in the online environment with an advertisement that compares mothers who breast-feed with the multitude of cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable health pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full-blown cowhouse on a melody that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm soft, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not sore, they're my breasts."
The report goes on to say: "Spring, pumping, breast-feeding, pumping, pumping, milking from girls."
However, the claim, published on the Facebook page of the company, raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video has been aimed at mixed reactions from those who have seen it, many of them stating that it brings out the "ororie" from the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, except because they are stolen children only a few days from birth," one person wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breast-feeding support (Elvie/Mama)
Another commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep babies?"
Someone else added: "A highly inappropriate advertisement."
Others have defended the claim, claiming that it seemed to him to be a "hillary" commercial.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a witch.
The claim is a bit inappropriate, but I took it like that.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertisement that targets mothers who use pumping (unless at work or in toilets) and who feel like “wages”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced in support.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use a blood pump say they feel like insects.
But Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a breast support, offering women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in their arms and even going out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and designer at Mother’s project, commented: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breast milking mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give him.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to hiding in a camp of refugees from the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have led to the collapse of the child placement procedure in sponsors.
Many sponsors are usually themselves immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will be in danger of staying in the country if they ask to take children.
The risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult members of the family, should register their prints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking customs and immigration officer, told Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of the minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous penalties.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsors' family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to accelerate the process of processing in the child system, the authorities have introduced new rules that require children to be present in court at a month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case by means of a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to request the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to the employees of the shelters and reports issued by the system in the last few months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are accentuated in a larger unit such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without providing them enough time for emotional preparation or to take good care of their friends could cause them trauma, many of which are already suffering.
Syria requests the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria is in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be adequately managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said during the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died from the year 2011, and millions were distraught from their homes.
It further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are about 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-spulbed country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem stated that there are conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "dispersaling Iraqi fears", which has allowed refugees to stay away.
It added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return".
"Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war end opposition.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to extend the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale assault by the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which will "be eradicated".
The Staff of Mixture, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee formed by members of the government and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the area for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "revision of the current constitution" and issued a warning of interference.
Why will Trump win second term
If we were to take this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the removal procedure or scandals would end his term of office earlier, which much of the liberal hearing is expected to happen.
In this case, it would certainly be "the most dramatic final of a presidential mandate at all times!"
Until now, it seems that the hearing is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audits have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the early days, the Fox News television station was followed, on average, by 2.4 million people, over the past four years when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the drama series "Chair of Reserve" from ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and driving the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
In chaos, entertainment is appreciated.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action taken at Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if the immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Exchange of post is a luxury that can only allow the privileged audience.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of debate by a committee of experts in how Bob Woodward uses sources "deep background" for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 electric skin jacket ("an object of opulent clothing", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels' "anatomical parts" of Trump's actress.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way.
"A lot of what makes you feel that you look at a reality show and feed you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Ashii Amaneto", about the constantly changing distribution and the daily disturbances caused by Trump (the launch of a fight with the American football professional league, praise given to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let you lose an episode, because you'll feel you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees out and there was the sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
It was not possible to slip out of front of the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and had to decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some of the issues that came out of the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seemed to be right."

Complementary external financial resources for the narrowest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders in an electoral course for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys comprehensive financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh has brought the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another term holder in the exercise, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly superior to the 17th.
Election cards were re-configured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional and that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The course of the 17th new electoral district has launched a competition in funding campaigns between key funding bodies of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, at the highest hearing, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade, the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the criminalization of El Salvador because of its understanding with China, but then abandoned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Steering Team.
The State Department officials decided to call American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But only sanctions against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support, were considered.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for the country in Central America and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considering a step forward in preventing migrants from being directed to the United States.
But by the mid-September, officials in front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, seeking to highlight the importance that the administration has given to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American ambassadors returned in peace to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without getting new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is an appropriate administrative officer and who also spoke on the condition of keeping the anonymity.
History study
The next thing that might happen is the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now strong public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation and investigation into the existence of a plot between the Trump campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he prepares to present himself before the electors and, if possible, a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a "fall" of Trump is inevitable, and it is also valid for its homologies in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on one side and on the other side of the Atlantic and which will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and lost such an opportunity to avoid the massacre years that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of these critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump abandons Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year it suggested the secret registration of the President and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of the President.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Research Office regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the election for a Congress that's going to get Trump to answer?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakian origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath on the table with the candles.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Gamer Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Joi, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will put it in a strong position to qualify as a Group G of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play in this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the player at the age of 31.
"We started the match thinking we'll get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could've written it down at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a correct result.
I think they were better at first replay, and we've noticed better at the second.
Joi, it's gonna be an important night for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel and more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let's hope we're going to persevere, leave the past season behind, and have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pensions
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how to be concerned, few people talked to family members about this.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the Nationalwide company said they discussed the cost of long-term care with the husband/society.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not initiate this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to offer you the care you need if you do not know your desires from time to time.
You work with the counsellor and the family to discuss the place and how you will get care, because these choices could be a significant factor in costing.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real help with regard to the payment of these expenditures.
Your long-term funding options can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy in cash, to help you cover these expenses or you can provide your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Put your legal documents to the fore: you come in the midst of legal problems.
Get a boost on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Consider, too, the implementation of a mandate on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that you have the facts, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer his questions about his medications and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are taking care of it?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle compressed in the Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while going to the house after a night spent in the city.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as being "accursed at random".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
The wounded didn't put his life in danger, and the police called the witnesses to make statements.
Storms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of the communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, an area north of the city of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, which is at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrates 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Doggala is a region on a coast of more than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region located at the bottom of a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular in the coastal region of Dongala.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of the Dongala Regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit the southernmost Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra de West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands along the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing damage and panic, because people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami hasn't started, but more than 100 people have died because of broken buildings.
2018: several strong storms took place on the tourist island Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily blocked under damage.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate to the post of vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska state policemen.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this female woman tried to call the police to claim alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in the custody of the police, at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting the trial, and is held on the basis of a bail-free bank, worth $500, according to the KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where "100% innocent" was declared when the complaint was requested, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A offences, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to a year and fined at $250,000.
They have also been charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's been charged with such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, it was accused of domestic violence, involving a claim for domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a state of drunkenness related to an incident.
According to his lover's statement, she gave him a punch.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after becoming part of the military forces in Iraq.
Cutremur and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead people
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are broken down and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred far away from the central province of Sulawesi, which is located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On socialization networks, video clips present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the plague.
The federal prosecutor wants a capital punishment for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor wants a capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to launch an attack on a motorway on the West Side motorway of the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trip in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has "intendedly killed" the eight victims and caused "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the request for capital punishment, filed in the South District of New York.
Both the accused may receive a capital sentence, according to the Court's document.
In a few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges including eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "substantial planning and premedication", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as "hate, cruel and demeanor".
“Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, according to the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy in the commission of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He testified to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the applicant.
Also, according to the police, he asked to drill the ISIS flag into the hospital room.
He pretended innocent about the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to implement the capital punishment, instead of accepting a life imprisonment petition, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutors not to apply capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians must "sympathize" with Eurosceptics, following the statement of a member of Parliament Theresa May who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" until now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge that May faces in relation to the extremely divided camps was emphasized by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the exits of the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying out of confusion that his compromise plan, called the Chequers Plan, is going through properly, facing attacks on those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it and on the European Union.
The alliances have stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptic and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and its 'chaos'.
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihul that he wants to "relevant to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough County, added: "I support the Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "I have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestion of changing the public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have reconsidered and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public is not in agreement with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party is not in agreement with it and not our activists who go out and support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, it added: "The prime ministers who keep their function are those who respect their promises."
As part of the meeting, Nigel Farage said that politicians should be put in a position to "sigh pressure" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"He's trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let him do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: "You want to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union marched through Birmingham two hours before a meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised the ban on "Conservator Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, met with the members of the Conservative Party and the security issues encountered in the party's application at the start of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running to the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running to the presidency after the November elections.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a summit in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chaired by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was in the center of speculation that could beat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was a meeting with number 36 with citizens with the right to vote using the first format since Trump took office as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes finding a woman in his forehead”.
A suspect was arrested in the event of death causing the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of a death that caused the death of the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting of Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the picture.
Sims, at the age of 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wade tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the original lot in the last season and playing on average 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Prix from Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team would have a key role in the process.
Looking at the first position in the classroom, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two tours and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first one who stopped at the box and left Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the box later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the driver of Ferrari to leave the free interior, after making a double move to defend himself at the third verse.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back of the carriage and was in place near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he found himself in the front for a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to cross over Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the 44th round, but he couldn't make the move in the last eight rounds, Raikkonen remaining in place four.
“It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a true gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to get victory in front of the Ferraris and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A terrible body language
President Donald Trump ironied Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, as part of a meeting on his insistences, as she did not facilitate Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting in exchange that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "living, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see handy, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and lying," he said.
“When you see that they published and obtained information and then say that they did not.
They're not the responsible ones.
Do You Remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easier to get the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..please?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating senators.
Feinstein was sent to the letter detailing the accusations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "suffered" in September, but Feinstein denied that "suffering" occurred in her office.
"I haven't hidden the accusations that I'm looking at Ford and I'm not the one that made it easier to get away from her relationship," Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep the confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have been well-informed by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “If I am honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continually defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democracies use accusations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any possible way.
Observe evil, immorality, they don't care who I hurt and who I have to destroy to get power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.

The Stars team in Dundee paid for the loss of Fridays in the Elite League, winning in front of the giants team in Belfast in the return match on Saturday, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the opponent team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the elite League of this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who regained the ground by winning the team from Dundee on 2-1 Friday night.

In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan re-readed the host team at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie an opportunity to register for an equal score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he registered his second goal at the end of the first rebate.

An air traffic controller died after ensuring the derailment of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers during a disaster
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe decoupling of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a strong earthquake woke up on Friday the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful replicas in the area and many people are trapped under the rest of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonious Gunavan Agung, at the age of 21, refused to leave his post from the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which woke up strongly.
It remained in place to ensure that the flight of 6321 of the Batik Air, which is on the track at that time, will be decoupled safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
The word provider of the Indonesian air navigation service provider said it is possible to save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared an helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, it died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will rise, because many victims are still under ruin and we have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The valleys up to six meters high have devastated the city of Palu, Sunday following a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the mini-archtics are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rapidly offering help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but you might get hurt."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", announced CNN.
Indonesia was awakened at the beginning of this year's collapse in Lombok, which fought with more than 550 deaths.
Avian accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane crashing into a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declared that a person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
This further mentioned that he is trying to find the man, along with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing track and arrived at a lake next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane was over the end of the track.
American national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the well, and reach the emergency exits of the landing plane.
He also said that the shipmates panicked and yelled and that he had suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Naval Forces said that mariners who were working close to reinvigorating a shipyard jumped in aid, using a ship that was inflatable to transport people to the shore before the plane sinked at 30 metres below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents by air companies registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its proceedings with regard to the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used mobile phone records to put Quinton Tellis' actions to the head, at the age of 29, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night he was killed, which was in contradiction with his previous statements, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had lied, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin on Sunday's final plea.
The judge has stated that he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop conscious?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of positive tunes.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues as it did initially.
They want to return to origin and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Commons in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?
A New Yorker judges a couple because they fired her after she received a text message "racist"
A New York judge gives a couple for the award for discriminatory reasons after she has received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that it was "for a color person".
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had given them in court for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her appreciation when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colorful when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUU, without a color person," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she realized that she was embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the tax, which is African-American, did not properly pay her taxes and that she was expected to receive a tax of Philippine nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she judges the couple in order to be granted compensation for the grant and asks for the sum of 350 dollars a day for six months, the period in which they were to live with them and carry out their activities, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do things like that," she said Friday for Post, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the claims about being racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared that I could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My sister sent her a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, his husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But have you left your children on the hands of a person you've been wrong about, even if it's wrong?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process of "extortion", Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to avenge a person in such circumstances?
It doesn't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is under way, the public opinion has accused the couple of socialization networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proved.
Paddington's editors were afraid that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear speaking, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
This further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would be optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60-year anniversary of the publication of books was a "dark-amarie" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success she later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to praise," she said.
“But, because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give him the merit of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to take a good call.
Upon landing, her daughter was transported quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in the tandem.
"It doesn't call often to tell me it's very serious and doesn't think it will survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me that he'll die in the next two minutes and that I have to take the rest of it from her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines given to her heart to continue pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
Murise a little while ago and the organs started to fail.
I was forced to stay there and wait, aware of everything that's happening.
I couldn't smell or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, being in the valley after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I held my head down and tears did not stop running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two pregnant women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they killed themselves trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in the Gali Country, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a molysing smile.
"Everyone appreciates the smile.
They always said that his smile would change your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died, because he arrived at a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said, "I still think you will have a domino effect."
This created the messages “for conveying to people that I can appeal to someone or that I can talk to someone, even to a friend.
Exterior yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, at a time since his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he's not feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children performed their gifts and she didn't even look in her eyes."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “He caused a huge pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Research Office
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking – an investigation into a limited period of time and a reduced extent – we could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the commission is about to "disintegrate", on the basis of a partial blocking.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks to the November 6 elections - if, as recommended, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner of the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weak.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators, to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in place.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to make the difference in the case of equality and to confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea unification ministry, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were more severe border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates perceived by those who transport illegal persons across the border.
The Phenian made no public comment.
A large majority of North refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
The Seoul officials declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees to be more illegal than refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still practically in war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Phenian for a few discussions on the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed, in general, to cooperate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of failure to progress ever since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security and, in such situations, we won't be the first to be unilaterally disappointed," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "steric", saying he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "isteric" and said that his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "sister," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal committee, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that Christine Blasey Ford would have been sexually harassed when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats within the Commission, calling charges against him "a wholesale and coordinated murder", organised by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has shown that he cannot serve at the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he has a participating character against the Democrats.
"I believe that it is downgraded by those statements and by the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi turned from the subject when he was asked if he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just wanted to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be reversed.
"It is not the right time for a married person to go to court and wait to say "woi! what a wonderful!" said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diet, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, right?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who has an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
Lacrims are allowed for the outsideing of anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I started crying because of an inexplicable rage, is that I was caught by an older woman's head, a cold manager I've always felt a bit afraid of, and he took me to the house of the stairs.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be happy to have caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democrat in Congress in the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extra-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as White and the Seven Pieds".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn't get in if she didn't make $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they only gave them $250.
"Do they think I'm getting reductions?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, it was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice due to emotions .
"You would have said I have a nervous crisis," recalls Schroeder about the press's reactions to her.
"You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my funeral stone.
"A cry?"
How can the commercial war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
Savings that announced the start of a trade war between the United States and China were austerity and, although there seems to be a long way to its conclusion, disputes between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, I say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, first issued a warning at the beginning of this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), effectively applying taxes for half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has been rebuffed every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10% for American products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit from the United States and is unlikely to make the world's second largest economy a step backwards in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but the public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its books well, the U.S. pressure on trade war could support China positively in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been suggested so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert group.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister states
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the devastated country of a war that lasts better than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to bring things back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and of unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 team after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American Star Phil Mickelson, who put incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water at level 3 from the 16th, giving it to Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golf player Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the resurgences, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at the 5th and 4th doors in front of the player from the last place in the European team's ranking, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at 2 and 1 holes in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match from Ryder's cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became European player with the most winnings, recording an average of 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy I could win again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, excitedly after the European victory.
It teaches his countryman John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the streets 2 and 1, at the individual, Sunday game.
"I'm very proud I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a kid," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being only over Jack Nicklus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinaryly throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have indeed done their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
We've gone through a fight.
Out of the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us."
