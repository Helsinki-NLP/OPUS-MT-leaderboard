Valiant additional MPs are concerned about what they look like as Marines.
Some Members do not understand why their status should be changed to the "member of the Wells Parliament".
The MPs were upset about the plans to change the name of the local east to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of all political views believe it's a disgrace.
One of the librarian's MPs said his colleagues were concerned that it was rhyme with the words "stupid" and "stupid."
For readers outside Wells: In the Welsh language, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "stupid."
The MP said that her group was not entirely satisfied and suggested alternatives.
The Valiant conservators said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the east, but they noted that it was a short verbal transition from a member of the Valiant Parliament to the "marinet."
In this context, the waly letter in y speaks the same way as the Yorkish English word u.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now developing a draft law on the amendment of the name, has made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what Members of the East call, of course, will be the question of the members themselves."
Since 2017, the Wells Government Act gives the Valiant East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals in which broad support has been found to be called the East of Wales.
With regard to the title of an additional deputy, the Commission has given the Member of Parliament the preference of Wales or the CPU, but the CPU has received the largest support during public consultations.
Additional MPs obviously suggest alternative options, but the way to reach consensus can be a major pain to the elders, Elaine Jones, who is supposed to present a bill about changes over the next few weeks.
Reform policy will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on disbalancing additional members and changes in committee structure.
The additional MPs have a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they are doing their preliminary work.
Macedonians vote in favour of changing country name
On Sunday, voters announce that they have changed their country's name to or against the Republic of North Macedonia.
National voting was organised to resolve a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens for a long time, they insisted that their neighbor's name is a claim on their territory, which prevented Macedonia's EC and the North Atlantic Alliance from being included.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, a rapporteur for the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the sponsors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeev, claim that the name change is simply a cost that must be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The called temple of St. Martin's silence, the churches in Harlem struggle for existence
"Before the old people spoke to me, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today here is neither what it is nor what it is."
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and relationships now," he said.
"There are only no more pleasant local guests, where people are always going."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale had been active for as long a period as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would return to where they had started.
Churches, – he added, – can be replaced by living women with kanaminiums, filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of the people who buy candinaments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it will be a speedy day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these candinacies will be adopted by these churches."
Both churches were built with a set of whites before Harlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870, the Church of St. Martin in ten years.
The first white Methodist crowd left in the 1930s.
The black crowd, who prayed about, had the right to own a building.
Saint Martin's Church was fascinated by the black-headed community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who appointed a bunch of merchants on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or ask black-suckers.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the shipyards under the direction of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the corals into operation.
Similar to David Johnson, the son of father Johnson, and any successor to the Church of St. Martin, pride called the coral “the called poor people”.
The expert who played on the coral in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable hysterical tool".
An expert at Tiffany Ng at the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first in the world to play the blacksmith of Dionysius A. Lind, who 18 years ago went to a large coral in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriver said that in the Church of Saint Martin had not replaced him.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complicated story between architects and advisors, some of which were attracted by false church leaders, others by empiricalism.
The turn of the heroes, the governing body of the army's assistants, was written in a campaign in July with a warning that the race "trys to translate expenses" into the turn of the believers, although the turn did not participate in the hire of architects and advisors who sent the march.
Some of the prey complained that there was no transparency on the part of the eparchy.
A 13-year-old boy's shark was on a dive to hunt the cattle in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting cattle in California on the day of the opening of the season hunted cattle.
The attack took place about 7 o'clock in the morning near the Bekon-Bitch beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hemel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been dealing with friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he went down with the others to help get him out of the water.
At first, Hemel thought it was just an excitement from hunting the cattle, but then he 'understanded that something bad happened: 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his key was broken," said Hemel, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" he added.
The boy was transported by air to a baby's hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The diversity of sharks that have been attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' rescuer said on the media briefing that the shark was noticed in this place a few weeks earlier, but was determined that it was a safe diversion.
Giles added that the suffering had been caused by the traumas of the upper part of the floor.
The officers shut down the approach to the beach from Ponta-Bich in Kassabilade to theirs in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct research and security.
Giles pointed out that in this area life is more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, opening sections with shops of beauty in the universe where trained specialists will work.
As a result of a significant increase in the British beauty market with an estimated 2.8 billion pounds of sterling that continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothes and household goods decreases, more large beauty houses will be presented in 11 halls across the country and also in other new halls next year that demonstrate success.
Investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on police stations that used to be used by television, microwave ovens and caravans for home.
Sainsbury's said to double the amount of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear first.
An existing assortment of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the firm departments like what can be found in stores like Boots.
The big shops are also relaunching their cosmetic shop Boutique, so most of the products will fit for the veganzas, and this trend is becoming more and more demanding among young buyers.
Besides, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the second is opened in Sali-Ouk (Birminge) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local shops around the house leads to more efforts being made by the supermarket to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, running director Sainsbury's, said the trading points would be increasingly similar to the universe, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's disconcertors, Lidl with the help of a large number of services and non-cash merchants.
Sainsbury's placed Argo's trading points in hundreds of stores, and also placed several Habitats points from the time that two years ago acquired both networks, which, in his words, encouraged the growth of sales of food products and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous Supermarkets attempt to reconstruct their beauty departments and the optics didn't end successfully.
Sainsbury's was a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share the revenues from the pharmacies ended after a number of divorces in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its pharmacies business together with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds played his role in this plan by extending the range of delicious brand care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We also invested in teaching our employees to offer their recommendations.
Our brand range is designed to take account of any needs, and a pleasant stay and a comfortable location make us a better house of beauty to resist the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was upset after Holly Willowby refused a deal for 11 million pounds of sterling.
Dragons Dan Peter Jones stared after Holly Willowby's television broadcast turned down 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowbie there is no time for brand brands for home and accessories True.
Business couples became like the brand Gwent Peltrow Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now breaking up with his profitable business to create brand clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source reports that Jones was upset when the "golden" girl of television admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow's (Bakingemshire), her new deals of up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling mean that she would no longer have enough time to deal with the home merchants and accessories of the brand True.
The business was similar to the brand of Guineat Peltrov Goop and was increased twice to double Willowby's benefit at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced in Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew out of the United Kingdom and headed into one of his homes for rest.
The source of the message: Truely was the main priority of Holly.
This was her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely insane.
No one wanted to believe what was going on on on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
Marlow's apartment has a warehouse full of shops ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of this Morning, which comes into the number of the most important British stars, can cost the company millions because of huge investments in various camps -- from pillows and candles to clothing and household stores, as well as because of the possible further delays with their execution.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Willowbie and Dan Baldwin's husband were close to Johns and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willowby founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the mayor's estate in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40-percent part of Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will be the representative of the M&S brand and replace MacPartlin's father as the leading ITV "I'm a characteristic".
Last night the source, close to Jones, said, "We won't comment on his affairs."
A sincere conversation, "after what we fell in love"
He sacrificed a criticism from the mass media for his comment, which is considered as "unpresidency" because it is always about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Tramp much refuse?
The tramp said to his "discreet" voice.
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the debate on denuclearization went on.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Li En Ho announced to the world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday that the North night was not expected to be the "proposal" of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the area of disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We will be very successful in communicating with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had led to the positive results: the completion of the missile trials, the help of the publishers and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"Being on the President's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people there," Tromp said, pointing to the crowd right in front of them.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have devastated islands, killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on Mr. Lambock's outside organization, they said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lamboca population were displaced, there was no noticeable national disaster, which is the necessary condition for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they did not seek international help, so it was a bit difficult," Mrs. Sumbung said.
Even the Children's Education Fund (Save the Children) and she's taking a mission to Paul until she realizes whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for the Suppression of Sick Disasters, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to find out if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that still survive in Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for unexpected nature.
Although in Achehe there were built shelters, in other coastal pastures they were almost gone.
The obvious misappropriation of the siren for warning of the thunders in Paul had led to a greater number of victims, though the warning had.
Even in better times, moving between many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And stressful disasters have complicated the logistics of moving.
The hospital ship, which was located on the island of Lambok for the treatment of the earthquake, is approaching Pala, but the path to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Jock Avida has set up his pre-convention campaign to improve the destroyed infrastructure of Indonesia and to spend money on automobile roads and bricks.
But the lack of funding is followed by the administration of Jock, as next year there will be new elections.
Mr. Jock also faces pressure from interconfessional tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives are taking on more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Starj from Liverpool pushes a ball far away from Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's defeat in the Prime Minister, equaling the number for 89 minutes on Saturday at London's Stemford Bridge.
The old man received a transmission from Gerard Shakiri, when they were about 30 metres from the "Chelsie" design gate, which was led by the number 1-0.
He made a fine ball left of himself before making a shot into a distant tinge.
The attempt ended by killing high under the top pole when the ball flew to the right top of the network.
The sword as a result flew over the head of Cape Arisabad, which jumped directly into the net.
"He just tried to get in this position to play the ball, and such players as Shak always tried to swim as far forward as possible, so I just tried to win us as much time as possible," said Starj in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running Cante made the dog easy, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
"Chelsy" was 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Azar was killed.
Attacking the blues in this match, he made Matthew Kovacich's dog before he returned to the semi-married zone and ran into half the Liverpool field.
The cook quickly found himself in the center of the field.
Then he made an effective blow, conveying the sword to Azar at the door.
Azar ran to defend himself and went down to the lower left corner of the far side of the pond by the guard of Liverpool, Eliza Becker.
Liverpool competes with Napali at the three-hour championship league in the middle of the San-Paul stadium in Italian Nepal.
"Chelsie" meets with "Videaton" in the League of Europe WEFA at 3 o'clock on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths caused by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported on Sunday morning by the Agency for the Eradication of Pacific Disasters.
At the press conference, the representative of Sotopa Purvo Nugroh said that, according to the news, many people found themselves trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-ball earthquake, which took place on Friday and called for a height of up to seven meters.
The city of Pala, where more than 380,000 people live, has been blocked by broken buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man who was suspected of murder after a woman was killed.
The murder investigation was started after the woman's body was found in Birkenhede (Merciside) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with a sharp wound in the Grayson-Museum area on John Street Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called for their people from this area who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhede or who saw or heard something suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on everyone, in particular, a taxi driver, video recorders who may have taken away some video, to contact us, because they can have information that is extremely important for our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenheed and was found in her own house.
Today's day friends came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said it's in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museum just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he learned what had happened.
I want to say now that there will be another few hours before they can let them come back.
The police have explained to one man that the whole area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "It's so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police personnel were inside the perimeter, investigating a multi-dwelling building.
All the information you have must contact the @MerPolCC police department, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue, Cromwell, has become the last ever-lasting hit in the history story.
His removal would be poetic justice for him like the Taliban's destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
"But the Society Plus described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the memory of Oliver Cromwell around the Westminster Palace would become the object of these acts.
English civil war icons were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his cousin Thomas in the previous century.
The clear presentation of Mr. William Hama Tornikroft about Cromwell is a witness of the 19th century's ideas and a part of the history of the action, which, as many people think, needs to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than today, as a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a manarchy.
Or is this a very accurate presentation, a subject of continuous historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually familiar figure that represents one of the sides of this encounter.
His achievements as the Lord-Protector also deserve to be noted and respected."
The pig-killer has made up for the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media reported, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in the south-west of China.
"The man, who only knows the name – June, was found dead with broken artery and yellow blood, next to the bread on the market of Ljupanish in the Gujjow province," the newspaper South China Post reported on Sunday.
The Swine was ordered to introduce the vaccine in May 30th 2005 in China's Chinese province of Kinha.
As reported, he and his cousin in the middle came from the neighbouring province of June to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pigyard was open.
He said that there was a great rabbit with blood on his sand.
According to the report, the medical expert confirmed that the 550-pound prince had abandoned the farmer.
"The feet of my cousin were covered and damaged," said a cousin named Wu (as quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John went to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager reported on Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the messages, the family of the Union and the market administration are going to negotiate compensation for his death.
Even if pigs attack people, they're rare, but they've been before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a weighing 650 pounds of lead pressed a cattle farmer to his tractor and kept it that way until his wife had fired the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Aregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act as a drop in the throat.
"They're just playful.
They're clever and very interrogative... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Rose hurricane bring strong flood rains to the south-west of the United States.
As a result of the forecast, the rose hurricane is weaker because it moves over colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days of Rosa, she took a hint in northern Mexico and in the south-western United States.
The speed of Roses, the hurricane of 1 category, was 85 miles per hour in the morning at 5 o'clock on Sunday, and it was recorded in 385 miles south west of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico.
"Rose," as expected, move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the low-pressure area, which moves east to the western coast of the United States, begins to form. When, on Monday, roses approach the south-east of California like a tropical storm, it begins to push a deep tropical wave toward the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will take in some parts of Mexico up to 10 percent of the cases.
Then the tropical wet, which interacts with the surrounding area of low pressure, in the nearest days calls for strong rivers in the south-west.
Places from 1 to 4 percent of accidents cause dangerous sudden floods, deserts and possible deserts.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to the number of accidents in places will reach 2-3 inches an hour, especially in some areas of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the north-west, especially in most of the Arizona, it's expected from 2 to 4 percent of the inheritance.
Due to the disaggregated areas of tropical rains, a possible sudden flood, provided that the conditions worsen rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go out in the empty foot due to the possibility of a sudden accident.
A strong rain may lead to what cannons turn into brute rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by a fair wind and dust.
The prevailing low-pressure area takes place a strong rain in the part of the coast of South California.
Possible nightmares more than a handful can lead to a minor stream of garbage and make the slippery roads.
It'll be the first drop in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains start approaching the Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
A strong rain will spread in the area of four corners on Tuesday and continue to Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature fluctuations in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature as soon as possible.
There's a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in Central America on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahi, Nebraska, St. Louis and De-Mynam, Iowa, the temperature range is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer heat will try to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in many Central and Eastern states the US will start a warm, 80-degree temperature-heated October, from the South to the North-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees per day, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the east of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavana’s hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting demonstrations of witnesses in the Vyrhov court on the matter between Brett Kawan and Christian Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, political resistance continues, the observers have interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news in Friday: the suggestion, developed by the Arison Senator Jeff Flakem for the FBI, was to carry out a weekly prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kawan grabbed her and tried to get her clothes off for dinner at the older school.
The coffee in his bare testimony said that 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen reported on Friday were looking at him.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, there's usually a problem with people who watch television in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the playoff or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported the assignment of Kavana, guided all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million spectators.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of the Kawan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protests shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator for hearing at the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was laughed, and it was broadcast in the direct ephrine on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
‘What do you think he is telling the truth of the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but many women are free of it."
Flake said that his office had published the application, and had announced before the elevator closed that he had yet to say in committee hearings.
All cable and cable networks for a few hours led a direct broadcaster, when the Judicial Committee had to announce the question of the selection of the candidacy of the Kawan at the Senate quorum.
But Flack said that he would do it, only by understanding that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which the Democrats call for from a minority.
Flake was convinced by a partial chat with his friend, the senator-democratic Chris Kunsam.
After the conversation with Kunsam and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not vote to confirm the Coffee without investigation.
President Tramp started investigating charges against Kavana in the FBI.
Prime Minister of Great Britain May accuses critics of "playing in politics" because of the phrase
During a Sunday Times interview with Prime Minister Teresa, she accused me of criticizing her plans to leave the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with the future of Britain and are destroying national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Teresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her in the first field of the newspaper, she was the Foreign Minister of Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "breeding" plan, saying that the suggestion that Great Britain and the EC have the only tariffs was "very wrong".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested a suspected LSU player, Dayton Simpsan.
The police arrested a suspect at Wade Sims, 20-year-old basketball player at the Louisiana University Command.
"The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for murdering a second degree," said police chief Baton-Ruz.
The officers showed a video of shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the shooting.
"The police took the oculars out of the scene and said that they found the Simpson DNA," reports WAFB, the CBS branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police said that he had confessed to a deadly shot at Wade.
“The cost of the building is set at $350 000,” says the Lawyer.
A follow-up to the East Batan-Russia report published on Friday in a previous report stating that the cause of death is a fire wound in the head and neck.
The Department of the Operational Police Group of the state of Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University Police are asking the residents of the area for assistance in research that would support the arrest.
A sports director at the Louisiana University, Joe Aleva, thanked the district law enforcement authority for "the care and the pursuit of justice".
Samsus was only 20 years old.
On the rise of 6 feet in Baton-Roz, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University Command.
In the middle of the last season, he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 points for the game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana University told Will Wade that the team was "depleted" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
Volcanic ash in Mexico
The ash that emerges from the volcano of Papacathepetl has reached the southern regions of Mexico's steel.
The National Center for the Warning of Sick Disasters on Saturday suggested to Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater found activity and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded for 24 hours.
In the center there was a squeaking and squeaking.
The images in the social media have shown that in the neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Sachimilka, there are thin layers of paddle cover on an automatic windshield.
Gephysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the steel post-magnetic earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has remained active since 1994.
Match police with Catalan separatists prior to voting for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the independence supporters met with the police on the grounds of public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in appointing the first anniversary of the polarization vote in the department of Catalonia.
The group of cooperatives in the masks that were held by the police on the grounds of public order left them with their eggs and dyed them with a purple color, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their depots to hold the ammunition.
For a few hours, a group of struggles for independence, which called for "Don't forget, don't forgive", met with the professionals present who shouted, "Live Spain".
As a result of the local press's messages, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received during the protest.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was marked by the sepharatists.
The voters in most cases were far from independent, although the electors' eggs were low, which was largely interpreted by the polling party.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting at the polling stations across the region as a result of the acts of disarmed demonstrations.
Groups that speak for independence spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narsis Termez, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expects to gain independence from Catalonia.
"In summer we survived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired," he said.
In spite of the important but minor victory of the regional elections in the past year, the Catalan parties that stand for independence tried to preserve momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile, or in exile, waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the next declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean-Puch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was reported by politicians on both sides.
"Be more and more stressed," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junckeras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who are in SIS at the end of last year, announced that they will participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The choice as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we saw on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after they had demolished the house on the car
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car had repeatedly been hacked into a house in London.
The Indent took place in the Belinagard-Cresent area on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said it was damaged by the gate and the building itself.
Maybe at some point in the car a bullet was released.
The result of the Lvingstan Meng's hit is a winner over Rangers with a 1:0.
The first goal of Dolly Mangy for the benefit of Lowingston won them victory
The success of Lvingston was the Rangers, and this was taken to name Steven Gerard after him a few injuries in 18 games on the Ibrox Club's estate.
The fall of Dolly Mangy was great, because Gary Holt had risen to one level with the "Hibernians" in the second division.
The Gerard team in this season won't be able to go to the front line, and next week it's meeting with the leaders, the Harts team, who's staying at eight points.
To this end, Rangers in the League of Europe receive Rapids on Thursday.
"Livingstan," meanwhile, continued his unforgivable series in the two-thousand-six games, and Chief Coach Holt still felt right after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Lowingstan misses opportunities for rough visitors
The Holt command had to warn long before they were killed, but such a move called for "Renders" a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke down, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halket's strike.
The gentlemen were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest in a few moments.
And that's exactly how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers were allowed a fine strike, and the Lioningstan was working on the debat, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to overcome Mango, who made a dog and killed it from the center of the field.
So far, "Randers" has been fined, but it has been found that the defense of the command is impenetrable, and the brothel of Liam Kelly was practically inactive.
So it continued in the second half, although Alfred Marelles really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pittman was painted by the Rangers' bracelet Alan McGregor, and the Litgos went far away from the second set of Lionstown.
The swords were constantly in the gate of "Levinston" and they were deposed, while two demands of the penalty, after Halket was called for the replacement of Glen Middleton, and the demand for punishment for the hand-playing, were rejected.
"Penome" from "Lovingstan" – analysis
BBC Scottish journalist Alessdair Lamant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Famous productivity and results for Lowingston.
For men they were wonderful, continuing beyond the expectations of this outgoing trajectory.
Their style of play and composition practically did not change from the moment they returned to the top of the stage, but it was worth giving the right Holt for the way he stimulated the team from the moment he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was huge, building a well-organized defense, while Manga held Conor Goldsan and Joe Urall all over the field.
Rangers didn't get the inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Jared's, they didn't meet those standards.
In the last match they didn't own, only once killing at the gate, which was something like an alarming call for Rangers, who appeared in the middle of the list.
Mixed View of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, they were smiling and felt unfounded when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's recent visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They argued about the human rights problem, the freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdagan headed to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey lives.
The police have fled for security reasons not to allow the crowd to gather in 25 000 before the ball, but a lot of supporters have been gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politician Erdogan and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect the diversity of the guest, whose one German Turks announced by hero, and the other condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: The user died when he was in a car
The user died as a result of a car crash in London.
Avarya took place near the crossing of the streets of Bejudd Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, on the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the nurses arrived, but the man died in the place.
Avarya happened a few months after another rival died as a result of a meeting in Chile's Street, about a mile from the site of a Saturday accident.
The static police said their employees are working on identifying a person and informing him of his closest relatives.
Around that place there are road lanes and bus stops, and the car driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Tower: Six workers injured during a series of riots
"Six tourism officials have been injured as a result of irregularities in the strict regime for men," the Penitentiary Board reports.
The unscatheds rushed into Long Lartin's prison in Austria at around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue to do so.
In order to combat the disorder in which the eight prisoners are placed in one wing, a special group called Tarnad was drawn.
There were minor injuries treated by employees at the scene.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: “The specially trained tour operator was directed to combat those who had committed disorder in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees were treated after getting traumas.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we understand that the guilty will be handed over to the police and can spend more time on the shorts."
The Royal Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the arrest.
And in October last year, police officers on civil order were called into prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were attacked with water pellet bullets.
Hurricane Rose threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong causes (which may be useful for drought-ridden regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week, because there are traces of the hurricane "Rose" in the south-west part of the desert that poses a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on sudden floods in the western Arizona and in the south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Rose is expected to take a straight path through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Center of Hurricanees predicts the fallout from 2 to 4 inches, and this can reach 6 inches in individual locations in the region of Magalion in Arizona.
In other regions of the south-west of the desert, including the number of central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with this individual results can reach 4 inches.
For those beyond the risk of sudden flooding, the rose hurricane could be prolonged, because their regions suffer from drought.
Although the hint is a very serious problem, some of these accidents are likely to be useful, because in the south-west of the present time droughts are being observed.
According to data from the American Dry Monitoring Agency, almost 40 percent of Arizona's territory survives the extreme drought of the second category," reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the Rose hurricane leads to the peaks of the Mexican peninsula of Southern California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a maximum wind storm of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico, and it's moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore calms.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, there will be a river going out from the shores of the day or at evening on Monday.
Accidents in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which will create a significant risk of flooding.
"The total number of accidents is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Southern California to the north-west of Sanlar, where possible accidents up to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then the Rose will move north through Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning like a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue through Arizona and south of Utah until the evening of August.
"The main danger is expected from the Roses or its remains, it is very strong rains in Southern California and in the north-west of Santora and the South-West desert of the United States," the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and floods in the upper part.
The attack in Midsummer Norton: four assassination attempts
Three boys and 20-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of horrible wounds in Summerset.
The three boys were found wounded in the Teras of Excelsior area in the Midsummer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in a stable state.
"The 17-year-old boys and both others, 18 and 20 were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summersett," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the cell phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"Cavendo is choking from the heart and anger of the Democratic Party," Tramp said.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for the rejection of the unsatisfied and absurd tactics of the Democratic Party," Tromp reported on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Tramp said that Cavano was "suffering from pride and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his election by post.
Cavano gave a statement in front of Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the charges of Christian Blaise Ford that he had been sexually assaulting her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence during the hearing of her accusation.
On Saturday, the President stated that "on this day the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and courageous character" Kavano.
"The voice in support of Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most excellent experts in the field of the right of time, a lawyer from the excellent history of the state service," he said to the crowd of supporters of the West Bank.
The president turned his attention to the Kawano election, discussing the importance of the Republic's expression during the interim elections.
"Five weeks remained until one of the main choices of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for big candidates."
The tramp disagrees that the Democrats intend to "oppose and obstruct".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level following the Kavanovo election will take place not later than Friday," CNN, the senior deputy director of parliament, announced.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of people suffering has increased
"At least 384 people died, many people died as a result of the flooding of giant waves on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi," said the government on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday, when they boasted six meters (18 feet) high about the beach in shelters, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake, a 7.5 - magnitude magnet happened to the tsunamis.
"When the threat of tsunamis came up yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run away right away, and they became victims," said the Press Secretary of the Indonesian Disasters Agency Sotopo Purvo Nugroho at Jakarta.
"The tsunamis drove cars, bears, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunamis were passing through the open sea at 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the crash on the shoreline.
According to his words, some people survived just because they got up on the trees to run away from the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 cents.
The aerial photos, published by relief agencies, showed that a lot of buildings and shops were destroyed, the masts turned and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next strikes continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday, about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb, dropped on Hirasim in World War II.
According to his data, the city's geography, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunamis.
Nugroh called the "wide" damage and announced that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and guesthouses were destroyed.
According to him, the whole of some victims were found under the cracks of broken buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 disappeared without notice.
"Average and damage can be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Paul, the area called Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," said Nugroh.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," says the Red Cross, adding that his associates and volunteers were headed in the suffering range.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the noises in the floor, but the reporters claimed that the waves had come when a warning had been given.
In amateur photos published on social media, you can hear a man on the top of a building screaming to people on the street of a warning of coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, pulling behind the building and the car.
Reuters could not verify the validity of the rejected material immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a serious power failure that disrupted communications around Paul, so the government was hard to remember saving actions.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but still evacuated very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The city's airport has been opened for help only and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vada planned to visit the evacuation centres in Paul.
As a result of tsunamis in Indonesia, more than 800 people died
It's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Danggal were successfully headed to the city of Paul, where the workers were hiding in the brothels of their offices, on their way, they saw the scenes of desolation," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even if the relief groups began to act in a dark way after launching disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers who have deep knowledge would be prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, supplies and personnel outside the border can only begin if the disaster area is announced by the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a crisis at the government level," said Aulia Arriani, the president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Paul, after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, the friends and families of the missing without information hoped that their nearby wonder would be among those who would leave the unsatisfied alien lines of the stressful disasters.
On Saturday the little boy was expelled from the sewer.
On Sunday the saviors fired a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her there was her child's body.
Hendon Sudan, a coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanarism Command, prepared two of the missing paraplans for the Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandago, in that number and the others who were in the trap at Roa Roa's hotel, were his students.
"As the oldest in the branch of paraplanarism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how in a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had spread among the communities of paraplanetists, he desperately sent messages to whatsapp participants in Palu who were at a beach festival.
His messages, however, had been marked by one grey branch, not by two blues.
"This means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling the ATMs in Newport on the left.
"The morning of Friday the robbery stole $26,750 from a Brinco employee who had invested in a bank account in Newport on Levi," reports the Newport Police Department's press release.
"The driver dropped a bank member in a fun complex and was willing to deliver more money," wrote Denis McCartz.
While he was busy, another man "run away from the brink's employee" and stole me with the money destined for delivery.
According to the message, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police didn't notice the number of incident participants.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kany West: Reper changes his name to Ye ("te").
The Kanye West rapper changes its name to Ye.
He wrote, "I'm officially known as the Kenyan West."
West, 41 years old, under Y, used this variable as a name for his eighth album that came out in June.
The changes are taking place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He's replaced by the singer, Aryan Grande, on show, who resigned for "economic reasons," said the show creator.
In addition to shortening his current professional name West previously said that this word has a religious value for him.
I believe that "ye" is the most widely distributed word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," said West early this year, commenting on the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So I'm--it's you, I'm--it's us, it's all--it's us.
It came from Kany, which means "one", to just ye" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our loss, our whole life.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who had changed his name.
Sean Combs was quite familiar with Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in this year he announced that he was inclined to the names Love and Brother Love.
Former co-worker Westa, Jay-Zi, also walked without any connection and with the general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful residents
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopes Abrador has never used military force against civil society since the country is approaching 50 years from the day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Abrador, the fans "never use the warheads to raise the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while the left students were crammed all over Latin America.
Lopes Abrador fans support young Mexicans, issuing monthly grants to those who are learning, thus opening more free places at state universities.
"The lack and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
The United States has to double its machine intelligence funding
"As China becomes increasingly active in the area of machine intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this area," says an investor and machine specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the various parts of the United States government made statements about ME, even if there was no official MI strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030 it will be the first in the MI innovation branch.
"The allocation of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we expect the next gap in the MI area," said Lee.
"Funding can double the probability of my next major achievement in the United States," Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, published this month by Houton Mifflin Harkurt, is the lead executive director of the Sinovation Ventures company, which invested in one of the most famous companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melean, he worked on a machine intelligence system that won the highest-ranking American player Attel, and later he was the Microsoft Research Manager and president of the Chinese Google Department in China.
Lee recognized the previous U.S. government technology co-operatives, such as the Agency's workshop on hand-held research projects in the field of defence, and asked if it would be possible to help identify the following monitors.
"The U.S. researchers often have a lot of work to get state grants," Li reported.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's corporate," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been engaged in candles from universities to work on MlCs in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should be automatically offered by the candidate in the MI branch," he said.
In July 2017, China's National Council issued a plan to develop the machine intelligence of the next generation.
"China's National Science Fund provides funding to people in educational institutions, such as the National Science Fund and other state organizations, making money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China below," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a United Nations machine intelligence center, where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on machine intelligence.
And this month, the Agency's dedicated research project in the defence sector reported investment of $2 billion under the name AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the US leadership, which sought to create a National Security Commission on machine intelligence, did not observe the actions for a few months.
Macedonians vote in favour of changing country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of changing their name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", allowing to resolve a ten-year conflict with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has Macedonia, claims that its north neighbour's name represents a claim on its territory, and has put a vow to join NATO and EC.
In June, both governments concluded a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist officials assert that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian population of Macedonia.
The president of Georgia Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the party asked the question of whether the electorate would match at least 50 percent needed to conduct the referendum.
The question of voting on the referendum suggests: "You are a member of NATO and EC with the consent of Greece."
The proponents of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeev, claim that it is a cost that should be paid for in bodies such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to proclaim the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievski, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not an obligatory legal force, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they will count the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires more than two thirds of Parliament.
The National Election Commission stated that no violations were reported within 1 hour of the day.
However, the apple had a total of 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said a 62-year-old elector at Skopje Tanevsky.
Prime Minister Zoran Zoran Zoran took over, his wife Zarice and his son Duška voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the name of the country, which opens the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Stromica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament's building in Skopje, 54 years old, Uladyir Kvardarko, set up a small scene and set up chairs in front of the tents, set up by those who would beat the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with raised heads, not through the service door," Kavadarko said.
"We are a poor country, but we are honored.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zae said that NATO's friendship would take the necessary investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be "for," because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" will be "the confirmation of our future".
In a question published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that the referendum will take part from 30 to 43 percent of the electorate, which is below the necessary equation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telephony showed 57 percent of the respondents who plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were saying yes.
For a successful egg reference, there must be 50 percent plus one voice.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious hit on the politics of the western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera from Manchester City goes to the door across the entire "British" protection.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguire and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of protecting from Britain by winning Manchester City with 2:0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At 65 minutes, Aguara made it easy.
The Argentine attackers got a tail in the center of the field.
He raced between three defenders of Britain before hitting the open field.
Then Aguera found herself among the four green shirts.
He walked through one of the defenders and wrapped up a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed his dog on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first hit in Aguer's sword, which took advantage of its right to ride the Britton bracelet, Matthew Ryan hit the right part of the network.
"Agueira has some problems with her legs," said the journalist, the city manager of Pep Gardail.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he killed a goal at the same time."
But that's exactly what Sirling gave Sky Blues the first priority in the struggle in the Prime Minister.
This show was held in 29 minutes.
Aguera got this ball in the depths of the British Territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sun.
Sean made a few adjustments before Sterling was able to reach the far side of the pond.
Attacking the Sky Blues, he directed a ball in the net before he jumped out of the border.

The Sherry wants to play the role of collecting items against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the co-operations in the play-off, there was no special reason to delay a new start.
But the ever-changing Shercer is hoping to take a shot on Sunday against the Rocky Calad, but only if there's still a play-off for Rocky that stays in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
The years have taken, at least, a unique place with the number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just so, at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will be composed so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've ever met this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this co-worker?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start on Sunday, but as reported, they are willing to give Shercer a ball in such a situation.
The sheriff who was going to do his 34th start on Thursday held the PSC session and will be on Sunday at the usual rest.

Tromp speaking in West Virginia
The President rose to the situation around his election of Brett Kavano's Supreme Court, referring to the importance of the Republic's expression of interim elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the main choices in our life.
It's one of the big, the big -- I'm not late, and I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
The tramp went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on right now.
And they're full of determination to get back to power, using any means you need, you see, the authority, the measure.
To them anyway, whom do they blame, whom they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to him, the Democrats intend to "oppose and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "bad, bad, disgusting, and false."
He fled to the Senate's judicial committee for prior recognition by the Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Feynstein, who received a sound rating from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Do you really want to execute this action?
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It is impatience for those who express their opinion
When Activists Momentum in my local party voted for me to hurt, it hardly was a surprise.
Finally, I, the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Liberian party, who are told that we are not welcome, are all to express their opinion.
My colleague at the parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship revealed to me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, similar issues that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders.
The news of the meeting, which was held on Friday in Nottingham's eastern Liberian party, says that "we want these meetings to be consistent and productive."
For the most part of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Liberian party, such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today at most the tone of meeting is not so and the promise of a "better, more soft" policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It becomes more and more obvious that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is appreciated from that side of view, it is primarily for party management or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues, with whom I had previously thought, shared the same political views, began to wait for me to take a step back, and took up positions with which I would not agree – either on national security issues or on the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a lot going on in social networks that call for the election to be cancelled, condemning the central policy, saying that I'm no longer in the Leibarist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I was more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me as a rule are political.
I am delighted by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who meet each day with the flow of sexual or racist consequences, but they never hesitate.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Leibarist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "insecurity" or change of party selection rules, we get worse.
For the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice, which have called me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Liberian 32 years ago as a school student who was responsible for the neglect of the Tatcher government, because of which my teacher in school was doing well, I have tried to resist the best public service for those who have more than I need - whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, in that number in the past.
No one in East Nottingham could ever get involved in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when the country is headed towards Brexit, which brings harm to the homeowner, to the entrepreneurship and to our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and power on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact the only message that I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my electors, it's the members of the liberator, or it's not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation will be and the political curiosity will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrous 38 - 17: Invincible Air at the top
Two late attempts, perhaps a few hits the final score, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting game of the tenent primer league.
Now they're marking a tournament table, one side of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances made by their masters, Coach Peter Morcy's death march had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The robin Cristy of Melrose said, "Give the proper Eyru, he dares more than we do."
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Clim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors, allowed Melrovus to gloat with numbers, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimov pulled the leaders of Eira with the help of the pen, before, directly in a stop, he killed, and then he made a salt try, making 17-5 Eira a stop.
But Melrouss well began the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogota, shortened the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of the Roared Nott, which was stretched out, and after the re-starting of Eire moved on through the attempt of Staffard McDowell, implemented by Clima.
Eire, carrying out Captain Blair Mcferson's duties, got a yellow card, and once again Melrouss forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However the gentlemen returned, and when Stroan Hatcherson got a yellow card for what he had shot Clima without a ball from a line of fine, McFerson landed behind Eira.
Klimov realized his attempt, which he made again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Row got David Armstrong hit in the fine and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to the fifth attempt of the lords of the field.
A Still Game star, like ready to go to a new career in a restaurant business
However, the Ford Kieran game star is going to enter the hotel business industry after it was revealed that it was appointed by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC show he writes, and he's filming with his former comic partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet reported that the next nine series will be the last in the show series, and it seems Kernan plans to continue acting after Craiging.
According to the official records, he is the director of Afringingmorn Limited.
Actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source stated that Kernan was hoping to take part in the "Flavouring Trade in the Glass".
'Our sea: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Maraki are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Pase.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In the military-martial bases from the Titicaca to the Amazon, we've painted the motto "Our Sea is on the right."
Revenge is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the shoreline lost by Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, still alive -- like the attempt to sail over the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached the maximum peak in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course she is waiting for a stable result," said the Balivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MS decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal after ten years of intense talks will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to conduct negotiations on providing Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a rival struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he observed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take a decision for the benefit of Bolivia, and it's a bit of a change, even if it does.
The organization AAN, based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the source of possible talks.
What the International Court of Justice's ruling is only six months after the final arguments were considered, to prove that the case was "not complicated", the Turkish expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate said.
And far away from pursuing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have left her behind.
"The issue of access to the sea was manipulated by the current Bali administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, the rival knight Marales lost the remnant of human well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged letters.
Former President Edward Radriges Welle, representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia "is the unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years has been separated from the mutual invention," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Marales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, used the marine problem as a political opposition.
"Balavia will never refuse his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The stop is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea King Ho says that his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Riya spoke on Saturday at the AAN General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfill the promises reached during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
His comments come as the United States.
Ry says it's a "inexhaustible dream" to continue sanctions and the United States' opposition to the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on the knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Phanyan does not start a significant process after the divorce.
And Kim, and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, require a second summit.
But there's a great skepticism about what the Pyrenees seriously consider to be a rejection of the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pampea plans to visit Phanyan in the next month to prepare for the second "Kim-Tramp".
In Paris' fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive main costumes on the way to shop in your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented an example of the number of unusually high-end suits for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
In this summer, Instagram has attracted the popularity of non-practice hats that designers have sent their faces to the floor.
Valentine's famous rice was a delicious beige hat decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included decorated precious stones of coffee, magic hat and even pineapple, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tim Brown also showed a set of wise men's masks -- just before Halloween.
Many of the different color masks were with soft lips and more reminded of Ganibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of them recalled a rifle for underwater swimming with a tube and a needle, and another similar to a frozen cone.
And if you continue to adhere to the vast attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who look at the style predict that huge hats can penetrate our entire life.
The capillary of a huge size goes on the fifth to La Bombay, a salamid hat with two-foot strips of width that can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratakowski.
A cultural label on a very uncomfortable hat, which had been thrown into social networks, pushed on another big face on the floor--a salami beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a buyer.
The dark orange bag of the Rafi, decorated with a rafia counter and covered with a white leather handle, became an excellent part of the collection Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 in Paris' weekly fashions.
Famous stylisticist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer had a great influence, and it would be hard to ignore the attempts on non-conform accessories."
John Edward: Language practice is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have achieved academic success, which has continued since 2018 with yet another excellent result of exams that are based on individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community start-ups.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools presented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further higher education, chosen by their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandel said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will remain in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder of what we can't expect only in English if I want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
As a result of this year's last exams, we see that languages take the first place in the league tables with the highest scorers in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS students showed that 72 percent of students reached higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent were German-speaking, 69 percent were French-speaking, and 63 percent were Spanish-speaking, and they also reached level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages such as vital life skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as objects are selected as STEM objects (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics) in educational programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
The survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons that employers brought about difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were associated with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for future careers.
In view of the more prospective workplaces that require language knowledge, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for your whole life.
It's possible to contact people from other countries directly automatically put a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adult Britons participated in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak well in a foreign language, and the French was the only language in which a two-digit percentage was spoken, 15 percent.
That's why investment in learning languages is now important to modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be distinguished by the languages taught in it.
A series of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will be teaching languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, independent schools will always choose from a number of teaching languages that are specialists in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to provide an environment of education that will train children and equip them with their skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what will happen in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages still have a vital meaning for the future of countries, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be viewed as “the practices of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and privilege for the youth of Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Sunday in San Diego
The beginning of waiting for fans who want to see Lebron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James was playing at a pre-season opening on Sunday against Denver Nights in San Diego.
But for as many minutes as he plays, you still have to determine.
"It's going to be more than one and less 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Corporal Lakers Mike Trudwell wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
In line with the practice that came this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season graphics.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Drop-down Timer in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a lot of company activities.
It's the first of five of the planned trampa's talks next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming the vote on the election to complete the vacancy of the Vocational Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the interim elections, as the Republics risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When does the tramp begin tonight in the West Verheu and how to look at it on the Internet?
Trampa’s performance in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 o’clock in the evening. ET tonnage, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can look at Tramp's speech in the West Bank on the Internet below in the direct email on YouTube.
Trump, more than anything, this week will consider hearings on the candidacy of the Brett Kavano Supreme Court, which has problems with the opportunity of charges in sexual harassment with the pending confirmation of the Senate vote during the week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans who are standing before the election in November.
In this way, the company of President Tramp announced that these five spokes next week aimed at "activizing the activity of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president goes to the maximum possible number of states, as we enter the tense pre-flight season," said the Reuters representative of the Trump company.
On the Wesbanco Arena arena in Willing, today's action can attract fans from Agao and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pitburg media," reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, when Tramp visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate in the Senate from the West Faithful Patrick Morris, who is the leader of the issues.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in the questions," said Simon Hedar, a pilot from the University of the West Bank, reported Reuters.
Riyadh Cube 2018: US command is being sent to fight to keep the hope of life on Sunday
After three one-way sessions on Saturday's fourth day, perhaps they were just what it took for this Cube of Riyadh.
The owner of the impulse seems to be a completely invented sports concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than co-operatives.
So where would they say the impulse now?
"They had an advantage with six points, and now four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," said Jordan Spetz, spying on the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, at four points forward, and in the game another twelve.
Americans, as Spith says, feel that they have taken the wind in their ease, and they have what they expect, not in the least, because of the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day long, and everyone can praise three points with four.
Spite was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These horrid cries of celebration became more louder than any round, and he sunk a decisive blow to play in the match on four fields when they and Thomas fell two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win in the 15th, was met with a similar cry, kind of what he tells you he thinks the American team is not off.
"You just need to get deeper and worry about your own match," said Spice.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 o'clock to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have acquired more points than Spyt and Thomas are the French Malinarians and Tommy Fletwood, the unscrupulous story of Cube Rider.
Strange but magical couples in Europe four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Malwood" was the only pair that had not made gods on Saturday, on the second half of the day, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday and on the second half of the Friday.
It happens, and as their energy, like, flows to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun rises on Le Golf National, than the Flywood or the Malinarians.
It's both wanted at the same time on different holes.
The conversation about European glory remains temporary.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergei Garcia, a hero of the earlier furthest when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
Gods and two twins on the previous nine broke the Spanish and welded it, with which they couldn't get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
With the match of four balls and fours, it's so interesting to observe carefully because of the interaction between the couple's composition, the advice they give, the advice they don't implement, and how the strategy can be changed in one moment.
Europe has thus far become a better team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth session it has also been shown that the US team is trying to fight, in which some have doubted, especially in the States.
Europe is going to the Riyadh Cube final with the number 10-6.
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Kubq Ryder after it comes out of Saturday's four-ball games and a four-man with 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet Tommy Flethwood and Francesco Malinarians appointed a struggle with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results to Le Golf National at four points.
The European side of Thomas Burn, in an effort to save the traffic they lost in Hazeltín two years ago, was retiring to an American agency in the morning's dissatisfaction with the 3-1 series.
The United States proposed a great deal of opposition to the four swords, winning two swords, but they could not do much.
To save a trip, Jim Furick's side needs eight points of 12 single matches on Sunday.
Flethwood is the first European beginner, who won four points in a row, and he and the millinary, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational exits, is only the second pair, who won four points for his first four matches in the history of the Cube Ryder.
By smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four matches, they've been wonderfully fortified to win the down Woods and the American electorate, Brian Decomb, five more and four more.
Woods, who was running after two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash, but now he lost 19 out of 29 times in the match four balls and fours and seven bars.
Justin Rose, resting on the x matches of four swords, went back to partner Henry Stanson in the matches of four swords to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky--takes one and the other place in the world.
Europe had not had its way, although it was pleasant, fresh day to the south from the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time top winner Jordan Spight and Justin Thomas set up a checkpoint for Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in the four ball games and came back later to win Puller and Rory Michaelroy 4 and 3 in the fourth, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Rider team returned with a four-point deficit that goes alone, though the owners of Furik should only paint to save the traffic.
But after the next two days, which are the best, Sunday's contract looks like if they get everything.
North Korea says "no way" won't be counted in a random order without trust
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday, the United Nations continues sanctions that strengthen mistrust towards the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot refuse nuclear weapons in a uniform manner.
R. Yun Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the World Authority that in the past year, North Korea had adopted "significant measures of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing zones and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"At the same time, we don't see the right answer from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way in the first place to unarm yourself in a uniform order."
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's 'step-by-step' approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded, as it took progressive steps, his application turned out to be significant in that he did not reject the unilateral declaration of denuclearization made by Phanyan in the past.
Ri has fled to a joint statement by Kim Chen Jen and Donald Tramp on the first in the history of the U.S. President himself and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim the Fascinators worked on the way to the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", at this Tramp the promises to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is officially attempting to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Pyrenees must first reject nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to abolish severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on "denuclearization" and increasing pressure levels with sanctions to achieve its goal in a mandatory way, and even speaking against "the declaration of the end of war," says Ri.
"The understanding that sanctions can put us on our knees is an inexhaustible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans at the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the U.S. leader had mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea leaders, Mun Jain, in the last five months, and added, "If South Korea had been a party to this question of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of South Korea would not have become such a topic."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he spoke to the AAN General Assembly stated that the U.S. contingent targeting using North Korea's missile was inevitable after Mr. President of Evil's Tromp called Kim a missile-suicide.
In this year at AAN Trump, who in the past year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there would be much more to do, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea denuclearizes.
In the middle of the Trump reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are fighting in the AAN. The Security Council has said it is worth rewarding Phanyan for the measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompey, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be active and must continue until we are sure of complete, final and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council strengthened the sanctions against North Korea in 2006, trying to stop financing the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Peñan.
Pompey met with Ri in the Security Council. The General Assembly then announced that in the next month he would visit Phanyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he left Phanyan, saying that the progress achieved from North Korea for a few hours had been over, ended with a statement by the nun that he proposed the demands of "like the gangsters."
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has pledged to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
Tramp said that Kim's "appropriate measures", which he expects, is a guarantee of security and an attempt to normalize relations with Washington, which Tramp promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course in good rest.
The new course of Harvard University this year should teach students more sleep, and my goal is to compete with culture to learn from coffee at night.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their health properly.
Charles Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical specialist named Brigham and a female hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first in his country in the United States.
An inspired talk about the impact of sleeplessness on learning, he started a course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came to me and said, "Why did they tell me this just now, at the last course of teaching?"
"She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me," he said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year, the course, taught by the student, explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sporting achievement, and also improve general settings.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to take the course after finding out that students were often sleepy for a week.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet where students click on a cup of coffee, aprons and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports shows, as well as the importance of the habit before sleep.
At a random stage, participants tell us how many years of sleep freeing can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive pictures, invites participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know that it will not momentarily change the behavior of students.
But we think they have to know it the same way everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the culture of the evening evening still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students lead to the relaxation of sleep, which is becoming more and more difficult.
"The assured adequate sleep of good quality must be "secret weapons" students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety," he said, even to avoid a false weight, as the release of sleep makes the brain permanently hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the assistants to complete an analogous pre-school education program.
Professor Chesler recommended that the students set up an hour to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, noting the harmful effects of the "black light" that is coming from the screens of the monitors and the light-emitting lights that can change the parallel mode, leading to the problem of sleep.
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Randers": Manga is killing Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered another time, when the goal of Dolly Mangy was convinced that Steven Gerard won't get the same 1:0 at the Leivingstan stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to the triumph of the number 4-1 in February in St. John's, but Harry Holton's command is already taking the second time as Gerard's 18-game manager to leave eight points on his side, leaving the top leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga hit him in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, the inspired head, didn't look like he was suffering right away.
At the same time as Rangers fall to the sixth place, Lvivingstan took the third place, and behind them are the Hibernians with a ball difference.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after the foreword of Colum Spence should be treated from the trauma of his head after he had the subject thrown out of the Tribune.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, why Ira didn't play in the semifinals of Kub's Betfrid.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 rooms, which allowed to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was in awe of how they went well at every step of their opponents.
"Renders" were more mastered by the ball, but Livigstan made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to be killed in two minutes already, when the first Mangy directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's doorposts, and then the half-witted used this chance.
A successful criminal strike by Jacob Keegan caught the surprise of Craig Halket, but his partner for the protection of Alan Litgo's was able to bring a strong blow behind.
Rangers took control, but in the last quarter of the game, they were more hoping to kill than they were showing a good game.
Alfred Marellas certainly had to be punished by the penalty for a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Steven Loveless met in the field, but Judge Steven Thompson did not take Colombia's complaints.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but there were the Brokers Liam Kelly almost gave up the goal of Lasan Kulibali and the effective father of This Acheria.
Although killing the first goal at the 34th minute of Libya, perhaps it was against a further active game, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate by noticing a good game.
Once again, Rangers couldn't break Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave up Scott Robinson's passport, which blocked Mang to get the chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced the Culibali's stop at Ryan Kent, and it proved an effective impact when the attacker struck Marellas, but the impressive Kelly escaped and blocked the strike.
But Lvivingstan continued to meet visitors, playing that game, which they loved and liked, and the Litgos and Halket continued to share the ball after a long fight.
The side of Holt could only prevail for the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to resist Jacobs's before the Litgs had gone to the bench of the spares.
The replacement of Rangers by Glen Midlands took place in turn after the penalty had been punished, when he met Jacob, but Thompson was able to defend himself.
German: Geiger's inventor.
A page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLY... the day of future physicist Iagan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring the radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of the device known as Geiger's counter.
Geiger became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Called the Karadánd", in which those who seemed to be young students Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the earpieces, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give you the radiation in the minerals."
Evans said, "Tell me, is this really disturbing right now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before 63 years of birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new advanced vaccine can help the immune system view cancer cells.
A new antimicrobial vaccine can help the immune system see bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine as if it was teaching the immune system to recognize bad cells, which would be part of the treatment.
The method predicts getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" the proteins, which are distributed in many cancer cells, and then re-enter the aid cells.
The test vaccine shows success in patients with different cancer types.
A woman who was introduced to a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has seen the cancer of the ovaries disappear for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so they can "see" HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then being introduced again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesia, Maryland, says that our results show that there is a very predictable vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of antibody cells that compete with small cell cancer, eggs, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofski.
It's like finding immune cells in patients and teaching them to get cancer cells worked well when treating the cancer.
The West Edge began a discussion in support of the Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after it appeared in the SNL.
That didn't seem good.
In a study on the evening of Saturday evening, Kanye West was despised after a speech he praised the United States. President Donald Trump announced that he would be involved in the second term in 2020.
After performing the evening of his third song called "The City of Privy", when he was in the hat "Make America a Big Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for the Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the white people, and they say, 'How can you support the Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have long left America," he said.
The SNL began a show with Matt Diamond's main role, where a Hollywood star was overlooking Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee as it dealt with the sexual violence of Christian Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of West Popala were framed and were loaded into the social media comics of Chris Year.
Didn't understand if she tried to get rid of West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They thanked me for the bullets.
They said, “Do not come out with this cup.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in the wrong place," he said, as the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: "Do you want to see the moving space?" "Says he" put on my scope of Skerman, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least two times he was heard, and the SNS representatives were confused with a message from Veraita.
West was adopted as a replacement for the singer Brian grande, whose had been a boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many performing songs I Love It, dressed in Perrier's water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative party manager, Kendes Turner, who wrote on the Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But by leading the show-off Karen Hunter wrote that West just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "arts", which I consider to be pleasing and disparaging the ideology that harms my spouse.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
In front of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he now "officially called Kany West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went after Diddy, as well known as Puff Diddy.
His colleague's rapper Snoop Dogg was named the genius Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, previously known as the prince.
Trying to kill Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after being in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on the second man on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamore, as the police report.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday in Belfast's court.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harrington's Play Throne star has captured the idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his stunning sword and role as John Snow in the "Playing Tables" series in the Middle Ages of the HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got a stereotype hero sword, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking in the Culture section of Sunday Times, Keith said he thought "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to her neighbor at the Roosevelt Thrones, Lesley, who was also 31 years old, admitted that she felt power in the way of solving this problem.
"Do I personally feel strong, when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men, when they grow up, from the point of view that we see now?"
Kit thinks that television must be responsible for the emergence of brutality because of very male characters.
He continued: "What lies at first and why teach it?
Why teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious what happens to young people.
In an interview he also admitted that the next summer the series would end, and he would come out of the field of battle the series and would not do the doxels or the cycle to the Free Thrones.
From November Kitt will be reborn by the true Western Sam Shapard, who is a hysterical director with his brother, who is a slave.
A recent actor reported that meeting with a woman named Rose was the best chance of ending the Thrones game.
"I met my wife in this show, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The Rose played the Ygritte, the character in which the hero Keith John Snow was in love with this fantastic series, which was reborn “Emi”.
The couple announced in June 2018 at Leslie’s headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to data from health care workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"At the same time, the number of people infected with HlV infection by blood transfusions has declined almost to zero," said the Chinese figures at a conference in June.
Yet, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is a major problem for the Chinese LGBT group.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people is still eating.
Because of the conservative value in the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread out of insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have universal access to HIV medicines as part of their efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the evils of the day, the danger and the theory of the conspiracy by her colleagues in Parliament
The U.S. Congressman Maxin Waters withdrew on Saturday the prosecution because her staff member posted personal information about the three U.S. Senates on Wikipedia.
Democrat Los Angeles claimed that there are claims to members of the upper wing and their sites.
"Truth, lies, and a lot of disgusting lies," says Waters on Twitter.
Published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States.
Information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate commission on charges of sexual harassment against a member of the Bret Cavano Vocational Court was on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators asked Kawano.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Weathers office and provided information to the Waters team," reported Hill.
"This unsubstantiated assertion is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my team whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these horrific and false accusations, at any rate did not respond to the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated assertion is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' application quickly called for criticism on the Internet, in that number from the former press-sacrat of the White House of Ari Fletcher.
"This refusal provokes anger," Flesher wrote.
It's to know that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone accuses them of not doing, they must not be caught.
They don't have to be adorable.
They must not question the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and gentle.
Flasher compared the Waters reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Cavano when they were accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is chatting and participating in the interim elections, also said on Twitter.
"It's a resonance if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the respective authorities and the legal authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again hits Rowen Atkinsan's invented spy.
Now it's a tradition to look for the sense of BREXITU in any new film with a British cover, and this slope seems to be in the comic and ex-French Jonny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and lasted in 2011 called Johnny English.
Can the satire be well expressed in terms of how clearly foolish we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was louder than all the comics he made for non-English audiences in cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, in spite of his sensibilities on glamour, got a little similar to Clouseau with Mr. Bin's rice and a little like that guy who brought the only note to the Hor fire at the ceremony opening the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally his character was based on the wanderers and international mysteries of Atkinsan, who used to play in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are a few pleasant moments that were not before.
I loved Johnny English, who was close to the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the day's success, and the paws of the rotor a little beat off his helmet.
Dar Atkinsan for the theatre comedy is being displayed, but humor feels weak, and so it's strange that serious movies, such as Agent 007: Mission Infinite, are certainly offering comedy as a major part.
Humor feels like it's not only for adults but also for children, and even for foolish accidents Johnny English isn't as inventive as silent Atkinsan films in the person of Bin.
Many years of current thinking are serious problems in the United Kingdom.
Cyber-hacker entered a super-secret community of British spies in the United Kingdom, opening up the names of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the daily agent, which is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Elden.
This is the last point for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and confused person who is already suffering from political intolerance: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this Quasi-Terezai-May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that, since every real spy will be discovered, she will come to activate one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English itself it's all complicated: he's now working as a sixth teacher in several school institutions and giving lessons as to being an unaccompanied operator: some good examples here, since English offers the Academy of Spynań lessons.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and joined his former friend Bo, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Now because my marriage is tied to the commandant of a submarine, whose role was Vicki Pepperdin was a bit empty.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting with the beautiful woman Volga Curilen.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire, who claims that he can solve the problems with the UK hackers: with Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their lunch from the immediate things: mask under the officer, burn the French restaurant; create a feast, fight with the smugglers on the edge of the delicious Volta yacht; English makes pure anarchy, because he tries to use the beauty of virtual reality to meet the interests of the Walt home.
All the moments taken for the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, where there's quite a lot of kids on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other films about Johnny English I couldn't think of: can't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Liberian Party rejects that a plan is being developed to pay the British for a four-week work week with a salary of five days.
Jeremy Corbin's job party has to consider a radical plan when the British only work four days a week, but pay them for five.
As reported, the party wants business managers to hand over the work results of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an additional day off.
It was clear that the workers would enjoy three-day outdoors, but they would still get the same salary.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to a party's economic program and plans to focus the country on the support of the workers.
The trade union's ride approved a four-week transition as a good way to use a change in the economy.
An older source in the Liberian party reported for The Sunday Times: "The planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but the four-week work week is an idea that matches the view of the party and the overall industrial strategy for regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian Party is not the first to approve such an idea, the Green Party promises to run a four-week work week during the 2017 general election.
However, the efforts of the Liberian Party in general are not supported.
The representative of the Liberian Party said, "The four-week work week is not a party policy, and it's not a party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that he had decided to return the power of "beginners" and "managers" to municipal entrepreneurship.
The plans of the black office also provide that the current shareholders of the water resources may not be able to get back the whole package of shares, because the Liberian government can make a "teach" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring employees into company councils and create a joint property fund to hand over 10 percent of the own funds to a private firm, which will contain annual dividends to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Grem, John Kennedy, spread for 60 minutes, that following the FBI, working with Cavano, would have to change its opinion.
The FBI's prosecution of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano has put the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court for at least a week. This raises the question of whether the Republican senators' office can be supported.
In an interview with Efir on Sunday, a 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pauly, asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "Sense," or could the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the South Queen.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going to the courthouse: I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after it happened, and I asked him why the charge was made, and I said, "You did it?"
He was decisive and unique."
Grape's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Bret Cavano has decided that it will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett firmly rejects it," added Graham, referring to Christina Blaze Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, there is an International Festival: an annual musical event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, over the past seven years, the World Citizen Festival will be held on a large corner of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the Jeanette Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, as well as to learn about the real purpose of mercenary -- the end of poverty and mourning by 2030.
The 2012 International Civilian Festival is a continuation of the Global Project against the Challenge of an International Propaganda Group, which hopes to stop poverty at the expense of increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket on mercenaries (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors had to do a series of tasks or be a "right of action", be a dancer, write through an e-mail to the country's leader, call any other person and raise awareness about the end of poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and could it achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a cost-free center in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivity" -- people feel that they're doing the right thing by signing online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, festival organizers have reported that more than 19 million “actions” have been committed by their supporters to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to push influential leaders to meet their responsibilities for more than $37 billion, which can affect lives more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group brought 390 comments on responsibilities and claimed at least 10 billion dollars that had already been allocated or collected.
As a result of the group's assessment, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and performers based in Great Britain, "helping children to develop in full," a promise to secure Rwanda $35 million to help prevent the country's mishap after getting more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"By supporting the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eliminate social injustices in the history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of London said in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the United Kingdom, which called for better food for the property and children, the government announced the financing of the "food aid" project, reaching up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival answered, "This will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we will endure at once and in the right.
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to be successful, because together we're stronger.
Jeanette Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Jeannell Monae, one of the many people who speak for merriment this year in New York, who will lead Debara-Le Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use VMS to prevent exports of Russian oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, turn to a military-marriage fleet to prevent the entry of racist energy into the EU and the Middle East markets," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, are the basis for studying new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as much as in Eastern Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the historian, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the possibility of using the Navy to secure the openness of the seaways, and if necessary, to organize the blockade so that their energy is not likely to fall on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed mercaprimity participants, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially equal.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more balanced and replaces the fuel," he said, calling Russia "a single country" with an economy that depends on the exhausting fields.
These applications were made at a time when the tramp administration wanted to significantly increase the exports of its confused natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much more expensive option.
For this purpose, Tramp administration officials, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "wrong" project of the "Mission 2" newspaper, which, according to Trampo, has turned Berlin into a "fired" Moscow.
The mask repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is starting in the economy and is an example of uncompromising competition.
"I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the US Energy Minister in the fall of Moscow.
The Americans received a hit in response from Germany, which again confirmed its propriety of the project.
The main German organization, which represents industry, the German Federation of Producers (BDI) has called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supplies," said Dr. Kempf, head of the Federation of German Manufacturers (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to seriously discuss his share in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator from Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the presidential election after the interim election.
During a conversation in Halioki's mother's state of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of his participation.
"The time has come for women to head in Washington and arrange our non-existent government, and I also talk about women on the highest seats," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to be very serious about the possibility of going to the president."
During a speech in Mary Wayne, she turned to President Donald Tramp, saying that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized the Trump and his candidate at the Brett Cave Court.
On Friday in his TV, Warren wrote, "Of course, before voting, it is necessary to conduct an investigation by the FBI."
However, the results of the questionnaire published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be discussed as presidents in 2020.
According to the political research centre of the University of Safalk/Bostan Globe, 50 percent of the "possible" electors of Massachusetts said the senator should not be involved.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The question showed much support for former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent were behind, and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among the democracies that argued about the potential overhaul in 2020 include former vice-president Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Byden, he officially made a decision until the summer.
As a result, Donald Trampa Sara Polin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Polin.
The 26-year-old Track Polin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in the truth.
On Monday evening he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What goes through my son after his return, I can compare with the results of the cash flow syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers return to, in other families," she said she would gather to leave in support of Donald Tramp in Tals, Aclahom state.
Palin called this arrest a "good question" and said that her son and other war veterans "returning to a bit of others, stiffened, returning with a question, whether there is that respect for which soldiers, refugees, other warlords have fought, giving themselves the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and he was accused of domestic violence against women, hindering the attempt to report domestic violence, armed robbery in a drunken state, according to the information of Dan Bennet, a press officer of the Police Department of Wasil.
18 states and District of Colombia support the prevention of new port-based policies
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a new U.S. policy that refuses to be a victim of gang pressure or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and districts of Colombia fell under an analytical note in Washington on Friday to support the prevention of port delivery policies, reports NBC News.
The full name of an actor in the case of Grace against Seshns, which was opened in August by the American Union on civil rights against federal politics, was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused on 20 July in the port.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with the largest number of requests for asylum in the United States, such as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American port policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which has allowed immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to go to port.
Colombo District Attorney General Carl Reisin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades-long experience of states, countries and the world".
“Federal leadership requires the application to be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” says an analytical note.
Jurists have also stated in a note that a policy that rejects immigrants is worsening the economy of the United States, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "make necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Seshens ordered judges in June on immigration no longer to give a docking victim of domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is a gift to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Seshns said on 11 June, announcing this policy.
The port never meant a solution to the problem, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
This is the hopeful rescue work in Paul. As you try to find those who have survived, the number of those who have died has doubled
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," says a 35-year-old mother of Russian Kusum, confiscating her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Paul.
"Every minute a car "fast" brings a cell.
Clean water is very small."
The lodgers began to return to their broken houses, picking up dirty things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 balls, were filled.
Some of the wounded, in number Two Harris, who broke the bell and the shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Paul, where patients are being treated on the street because of the strong blows that are repeated.
In his eyes there were tears when he recalled the feeling of strong underground blows in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard a woman call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of using propaganda advertising to "fear threats"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of the American-China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Tramp in the past mentioned China Daily's pay add-on in Des Moines Register, the most sold-off newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China's prosecutors tried to get involved in the U.S. Congress's election on November 6th.
The accusation that China tried to get involved in the U.S. election meant that American officials were called in a conversation with Reuters in a new phase in Washington under pressure on China.
Although the location of a commercial by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have launched a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposition of import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts, were introduced to harm such an exporter as Prime Minister of the State of Iowa, who supported the Republic's Tromp Party.
Terry Branded, the US Ambassador to China and the governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by printing propaganda in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Brandt wrote.
"And if you look at the newspapers in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real display of other opinions that Chinese can have for a dangerous trajectory in the economy, bearing in mind that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to propose" to print his article, although he did not call it a newspaper.
Republicans avoid women voters' early interim choices from the Kawano community, warning analysts
While many well-known Republicans are defending a candidate for the seat of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano in front of the face of several charges of sexual violence, analysts warned that they would get hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most Republicans already show that they were ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Rhysar, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of The Hill for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
The speaker said that he is not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arison) statement on the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, chief adviser and national press secretary of the MovementOn Progress Group from Washington, about Colombia, on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesting campaign was launched on November! During a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to resign the candidacy of Cavano, despite the statement of Dr. Christian Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be extremely big," said the new St. Rottenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 years old, who don't even like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before the open Ford's statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a candidate in the Criminal Court in sexual violence, analysts believe that if Republicans will insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in the response.
"For the Republican Party, it has done some mix," said Michael Stett, who was the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the voting of a committee or about the final vote, or about whether the Cavano is going to be held on the floor. It is about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they came up to it," notes the new Hai Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select the democracies.
However, it's like the Americans are divided into the rights of Ford or Cavano, which is a little bit more speaking than the last.
A new question from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the pensioners are sure of whether or not they trust Ford very much, and 35 percent said that they are sure of whether or not they trust Kawano very much.
In addition to this 38 percent said that, according to their opinion, Cavano may or may have failed in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a strike on the part of the Fleke FBI, he investigates charges on the part of Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's Legal Committee, that Kawano, when he was drunk, was seeking her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate in the Vyrhov court showed her his genitals at night when they were studying in Eile in 1980.
A world-wide network inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
This Berners-Li, a world-wide network inventor, launches a startup that will become a Facebook, Amazon, and Google competitor.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Le Solid platform.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store the data and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he sacrificed that, creating the Inrupt, he meant "remind over the world."
"You have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own Internet or POD repository.
This can contain contacts, mailing lists, calendars, fanatics and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available all at once on one browser simultaneously.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to the information type.
It's called "personally boosting potential through data."
According to the executive director John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt allows the company to communicate together resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms bought by IBM, a number of developers working on a contract project and a collaborator.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Li said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not complete changes if all their business models were immediately reviewed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on media Berners-Li, the Inrupt mission "is the provision of commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet, creating the Consortium of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Le spoke very strongly about the neutrality of the network.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will become the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the network," said Berners-Le.
Bernard Van: honoring a saint born by the Victorian Cross in the First World War
The only English church pastor, born to the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighting participant, was marked in his town 100 years later.
Commander Bernard Van was reborn on September 29, 1918, for his father's participation in the Belenglaz and Leakur.
In four days, however, he died of a sniper bullet and never learned that he had received the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptonshire, two of his grandchildren on the parade opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic," that the stone was opened 100 years after his grandfather was reborn.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van took his battalion through the San Quentin channel "through a dense angle and under a strong pink and clumsy fire of the worker."
Then he ran on the line of fire and “with great boldness” led the soldier forward, grabbing the harp by himself and removing three divisions.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a winner after the council, which appointed the Imperial Young Arrestor Brandwood.
Michael Van said that “for his great honor to take part in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support shown by many.”
MMA fans all night waited to look at Bellator 206, they got Pepa pig instead
Just imagine, you've been staying all night to look at the packaged transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're refused to take a look at the main event.
In the program with San Hase, there were 13 battles, including six on the main card, and they showed up in the direct ephera all night on British Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerr Musasi and Rory McDonald were making their way up to the dawn, looking in the United Kingdom, they were just joking when the program changed into Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, especially waiting for this battle.
One of the dancers on Twitter called switching to a child mutiny as "some are stupid jokes."
In answer to the question of broadcasting Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president Bellator on marketing and communication, said, "The state order and 6 mornings were inappropriate and the content had to be switched to a child's program."
"Yes, "Swinka Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that in the future they would work on a program to count British observers.
"I think we're considering the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can resolve this issue," said Koker.
"But now the sixth morning on Sunday, and we can't decide it until Sunday at our time, and it's Monday at their time.
But we do everything possible.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the question by considering that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can tell you that the next time it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of strokes from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to advise fans, but we're getting old.
It's an extreme situation."
"Discs of inhumane island": Tom Dale felt "insignificant" because of sexuality
The alpian ghost in Tom Daily's water jumps said that growth with a sense of insignificance for others because of their sexuality -- but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all is like me," until he went to high school.
Speaking in Radio 4's Radio 4's in charge of Lauren Lavern, he said he supported gay rights to give another "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less of winning the Olympics.
Traditionally leading this pretty old program of Kristi Yang, took rest for a few months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who appeared on an inhuman island, on the first programme of Lawrence, Dale said that in childhood he felt "less" than all the others, because "the society didn't accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I now think that this feeling that you're not like all the things that are insignificant was what gave me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that there was a "kiss," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
A double bronze example of the alpoid has been made by a large LGBT movement activist and at the Sociétés in Australia this year's country's calls not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was happy to live open, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, director and president of Dustin Lance Blake, who met in 2013 -- "it was a surprise to me."
Daley married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but, in his words, the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you're going through this in such a young age," he said, "at the first amphibian, he was 14 years old, and in three years, his father died of cancer, and he said it was hard to find a rabbi who would survive such an ups and downs.
In June they became fathers, their sons called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dale said that his "perspective entirely" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I need to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the golden alympic medal.
Robbie, it's my golden alpian medal."
His son is also called his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was whether they bought tickets at the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and dying, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
The next year, Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to jump in water in front of my ballers in the Alpine games, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the choice of song – the Proud of Hezer Small – which found a van in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now running.
"Discs of Inhuman Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 on British summer time.
Mikkelson, who is not in shape, stays on the bench of the spare in Rider's cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson on Sunday set a record, playing his 47 matches in the Rider's cup, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't get unlucky.
Mikkelson, who will play in this co-operation, which runs once every two years, the 12th record, the captain of the Jim Furick command has been sitting on the bench of the rescuers on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, a five-time Cup winner divided his days between the work of the cyclist and the coaches, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for an awkward Le Golf National field, where he is severely punished with improper hits.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Mikkelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact British Open French Malians champion, who, along with Tommy Flethwood, won all four matches this week.
If Americans, who stay at four points at the beginning of 12 single battles, start with success, Mikelson's battle can be extremely important.
The Fürich expressed confidence in this player, but he could say nothing more.
"He fully understood his role today, rubbed me on my back, whispered and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He is very confident in himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Glory and gave a very much command in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two matches.
I was planning more, but I was working just like that, and that's how we thought we were playing.
He wants to be in the field, as well as everyone else."
Mikkelson beats Nick Fald's record by the number of matches in the Rider's cube played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Rider's cup, which was never the same as reaching in individual games.
In Michaelson, 18 won, 20 lost and seven-half, although Furick said his presence brought benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke about people and just a very good man who's good at the team," he explained.
"I think that the younger players with the pleasure of parading his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the command much more than just a game."
The Captain of the European Command Thomas Burn knows that a great cut can soon disappear
Thomas Burnh, the captain of the European team, knows with experience that a significant cut in front of individual games the last day on the Rider's cup could easily disappear.
A Danish debut player in the 1997 Valderam game, where the European team under the direction of Seva Balesteras had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but financed with a minimum of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Valderham we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," Björn said after reviewing how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and brought the number 10-6 to Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in command that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to play at all the hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the dots appeared in the table, nothing was finished.
We have a goal, and this is an attempt to win this race, that's what we're going to focus on.
I say this all the time, I'm looking at 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the opposite side is the best players in the world."
Satisfying as his players played in the heavy field for golf, B'arn added, "I'll never judge myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow will be individual games, and that's quite different.
It's just great if you're in a field with a partner and it's all going well, but if you're playing one, here's proof of your real talents of a golfer.
That's what you need to tell the players that they have to show tomorrow the best.
Now you have to leave a partner, you have to go and show it all the best as an individual player."
Unlike Burne, his rival Jim Furick expects the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four.
Fürick himself was on both sides of these matches last day, playing in a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "Wood in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question, as Ben Crencho, the 1999 captain had set up his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start that you've seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed grows, the greatest pressure is on those who play the ball in the middle.
We set up a proper schedule and put the players as we liked it.
Thomas got the task of starting to play and speaking against Rory Makilroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Roosevelt, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Jan Paulter would play against the cooking Galistians.
"I've put my players in such order, because I think I'm going to close it all," said Burne about his choice for individual fighters.
The start of a new German military ship has been redeployed
Germany's new IMF frigate had to come in in 2014 to replace old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear not earlier than the following year due to bad systems and ever increasing costs, according to local media news.
The Rhineland-Pfalz, a major ship of an absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was transferred to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to enter the building in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg warships, which were scheduled for 2007, have to replace the old Bremen frigates.
They'll be armed with powerful weapons, various anti-corresponding and senate missiles, as well as some "stals" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characters – longer periods between telecommunications – more new frescoes may not enter their castle for two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern battleships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate their power beyond the country -- will expire until they finally enter into a state of distress, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fragment fell into the headlines last year, when the German IMF officially refused to take the ship and returned its Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
The first warship returned the ship to the shore after delivery.
Of course, the reasons for the return were few, but German media wrote about many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in the war mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg's ships have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of the old Bremen frigates.
It also found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of a class that used Germany in the Second World War.
Apart from the lack of cost of the entire project – including team learning – there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- although it initially amounted to $2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the sea power of Germany is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, said that the IMF "has fewer ships capable of military missions".
He said that the problem sometimes increases because the old ships are listed, and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates could join the IMF.
National Society for the Memories Listened to the Secret Life of Talkers
A new research that is being conducted in Scotland's mountains, aimed at identifying how they use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists are hoping to find something new in the behaviors of unique flying milkworms and to help in future actions to preserve these animals.
The research of the scholars of the National Society of Storage of Shatland is done by small talks and also by long sound talks by Dabanton in the Inver Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this location to watch the speakers' actions during the season.
Company workers and waltzers will conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all the recordings determines the frequency of speech calls, as well as what they say they do.
The map of life and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, a consultant for the conservation of nature, hopes that the results will show what areas are most important to the speakers and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the advantages of creating habitats such as people, and how to support forests for the survival of bats and other animal-related habitats.
The number of speakers in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developmental work that affects and destroys the habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as stickers for flies and some chemicals for building materials.
They're said not to be blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife, the ears of speakers are more sensitive than the eyes when talking about hunting.
They use complex elation technology to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
National company, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about talking.
It has ten scientific experts who regularly conduct research, live-place checks, and sometimes rescue merapies.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish constable of speeches in the Triv coin in Damfris and Galavey, where eight of the ten types of talks live in Scotland.
David Thompson's monkey manager says it's an ideal territory for speakers.
"Here, in Triv, we have just a great place for speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about the speakers yet, so our work here and in other coins will help us to understand what they need for a better life."
It underscores the importance of checking the existence of speakers before taking up the property repair, as one seat can be deliberately destroyed by killing up to 400 male and young speakers, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are told to be under shelter and they are forbidden to kill, fear, worry or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, an organization worker in Scotland, calls on the public to help with this.
She says, "We still need to learn a lot about our speakers, and we don't even know how their populations live."
Ranalda pleads charges in rape, and his lawyers are going to court in German history.
Cristian Ranald called his accusations in a rape of fake news, saying that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial for the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The foreword of the community in Portugal and Yventus was accused of rape by U.S. Catherine Mayor in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then if he paid her $375 000 for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the video Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranald addressed 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the publication of the charges, calling this message "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
"They want to make an ad on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
Jurists of Ranald refer a case to the court against Der Spiegel's journal on charges, which they called "an incorrect message of suspicion in a private case", reports Reuters.
A lawyer, Christian Shertz, said that the player would need compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
If there was an incident in June 2009, the luxury of Palms Houttel and Casinov in Las Vegas.
If he had met at a nightclub in Ranald and Majorg, he would have returned to the footballer's room, where he would have raped her individually, as written in the documents of the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that, Ronald withdrew and said that at '99 percent' he was a 'good guy' who suffers from 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ranalda admitted that they had sex, but on the other hand.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then she agreed on a post-trial settlement because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she was "submitting it to the public."
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge, because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
At a time when Ronald had this case, he was going to go to Madrid's "Real" from Manchester United, and this summer he went to the Italian "Yventus", closing the deal in 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain's Always Grief Loses Automobile Builders
Britain "always hurts" when it loses its world car driver's status after Brexit, the Minister of Business, Greg Clarke, said.
He added that his "disquieting" to Toyota UK's BBC statement that if Britain leaves the EU without warning, the company will temporarily cut production in Bernston, regardless of Debbie's half.
"We need a reminder," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that a delay on the border resulting from Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
In Bernston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are doing, almost 150,000 cars were released last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the Euro-Assistant countries.
"In my view, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production on our farm will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain raised the question of how to implement a cross-border trade when Britain comes out of the EU without a mention, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's closing his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is that the car manufacturers are talking about the risk of chain chains as a result of Brexit's unremembered.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "precisely in time", when spare parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for the cars that are being ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March, there may be obstacles that lead to delays and disadvantages.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to keep the factory in Derby more than a day's spare part, the company said, so the production stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that the "Chequers Plan" of Teresa May about future relations with the EU "has been done precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We need a reminder. We want to get the best advice that will not only allow us to succeed today, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we must be able to continue the work of successful lines of posts."
Toyota's company couldn't report how long it would not work for production, but warned the future that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and reduce jobs.
Peter Covalaris, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is the trade coordinator, said that the trade union members are very concerned: "If my job is short, they will not be renewed.
The President-in-Office said, "We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU that deserves trust."
The White House says that the Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
A very important meeting of Donald Tramp with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deposed for a week" while fighting around the candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, the representative of the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who studies the involvement of Russia's election, the relationship of the Tromp's assistants with Russia, and the potential prejudice of the judiciary on the part of the president.
To release the Trump Assistant Attorney General or not, and thus threatens the independence of Muller, for months pours oil into the fire of your Washington flesh.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been considering the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Tramp, and the possibility of withdrawing the president from the passport with the help of 25 corrections.
Rosenstein turned it around.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of a hearing about what was going to fall off.
Instead, it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with Tramp, which was then in the headquarters of AAN in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't "want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid listening to the Senate's legal committee, where Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Cavano, which further slowed the Senate vote.
The Press Secretary of the Sara Sanders Trump appeared in the Fox News Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday program.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date may not be scheduled for this week, perhaps next week.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the most new information."
Some reporters are willing to see her statement: Sanders didn't run a press briefing in the White House on 10 September.
Leading the program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings is called don't ignore the TV reporters who are "working for the public," even though she added, "I agree with the fact that they work for the public."
Then she said that direct contact with the Trump and the press would increase.
"The president met more with the answers to the press's questions than any president who had it," she said, adding without any specific facts: "We have studied these figures."
The briefings are taking place, reported Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask directly the questions of the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks.
The tramp regularly answers questions when it leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or in press conferences with high external guests.
The president's press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, if freely and sometimes extraordinarily, he appeared in front of the reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in Scotland's health care system in front of the British
The minister of health wrote to an EU worker who works in Scotland's health care system to express his gratitude for the country's name and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before leaving the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of EU citizens living in state services.
In her letter to Mrs. Freeman, she wrote: "The summer talks between the UK and the EU continued on the way out of our country, leading to the expected decisions of this fall.
But the British government has also accelerated the preparation for the script without mentioning it.
I know that for all of you, it's a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and not only provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay with us very much."
Cristian Abercrombie carried out a term operation after a head trauma
Linebacker Command Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercromby took over the term operation after he had suffered a headache in a Sunday match, which his team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee State Rod Father said to the reporter that a trauma player got a short break.
"He went to the sideline and suddenly fell," said the Father.
The coaches and the doctors gave the Abercombi acid still in the field, before putting it on the force and carrying it to fix the diagnosis.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operating at the medical center of Vanderbillt.
Harris added that there was no more "favor than it was a trauma," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Abercombi, a middle-class sportsman, runs the first tennis state season after he leaves Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full pickups, which gives a total of 18 pickups for the season.
External buyers of British real estate will pay a lot of money
According to the new plans of conservators, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher post, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralises the success of the initial Corbin by attracting young voters
An increase in the government's post is due to those who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today Teresa May announce that the foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government post, and the additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative by attracting young voters, as well as the available housing. It is directed at people with high income.
An increase in the government's post is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money they get will go to the government's living program for the homeless.
An increase in the current state mission, including a higher level, taken two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and a rent dwelling, can make up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is hoping to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and a new buyer is making it difficult to buy his first dwelling.
Many rich regions of the country - especially the capital - have become "garden-privileged" because a large number of buyers are not living in Great Britain because of the limit of time.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson's call to reduce the government's remit for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused major construction firms of holding high prices for real estate by taking up the land and not using it, and urged me to cancel the quotas for an accessible dwelling to make a 'disgusting living' situation in Britain.
Corbin's master announced a loud series of residential reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the halting of the "unreasonable" exit.
He also wants to convey to the local council more powers in the area of residential construction.
Mrs. May said, "In the past year, I have said that I will devote my work to the presidency of the Prime Minister of the Renewal of the British Sea -- life for every new generation must be better.
This means improving our incapacitated residential market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
But it's unfair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too many dreamers to have their own home become more and more incapacitated, and the problem of strangers remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run the Scottish community"
Coach Sanderland Jack Ross said his main ambition was ever to be a trainee in the Scottish community.
42-year-old skater performs the task of upgrading the club from the north east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved on to this work in the summer, after returning "San-Mieren" to the Scottish Prime Minister in the past season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," said Ross in BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up, often in pain for Scotland at Hampden with my father's stadium, and something always made me come back.
But that's the chance to happen if I'm a successful club coach."
Among the predecessors of Rosa are Coach Sanderland, Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poye, and Paul D'Kanya.
Former coach Aloa Atletik says he didn't feel afraid of such famous names in such a big club, prior to rejecting the suggestion from Barnes and Easter Town.
"Now I'm going to be successful for me to answer the question, 'Will I be able to return this club to the Prime Minister of the League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club its place certainly in Prime Minister Lize," he said.
"It's not just to get him back there, but I'll count my work as a success only if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, so far he was an assistant coach at the "Dambarton" and worked for 15 months at the "Harts" training station.
Then he helped Aloa get back from the third league and turned San-Miren out of failure, which almost hit the Championship to win the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartpool, Falkiirku, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academical.
Reflecting on the work at Aloa, he said, "This was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing because I worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I'm going through it now when you talk about stress and pressure, but training is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing this, and for me this is the best time for my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on the Sportssound Saturday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 in British summer time.
The perfect time to drink the beer pin was 17:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The hot summer increased the income of British pubs fighting for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics, the profit and the bar group marked an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but the sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent in the restaurants.
Peter Martin, from the CGA's advisory business group, which collected this statistics, said, "The sun's rising and longer weather was expected to be shared by the English community at the World Championship's final, which means that in July there was what happened in June, when the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and the restoratives suffered even more.
The decrease in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they show the best result in contrast to restaurants.
The pubs, which sell more food, also burned down in the sun, though not as strong as the restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In the pubs and bars there was an increase of 6.6 percent, and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation, said, "These results are a trend that we see from the end of beauty.
The water and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restaurants continue to compete, because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent a year, and it's very unpleasant if the costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the best time for operators focused on food, and time will show whether lower temperatures in August bring such a welcome relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened, has been set at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the release of fires.
The sales reference tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total defence of 9 billion pounds, and is an important orientation of this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the Web that it hides from the parents
The study showed that every fifth child -- something only happened 11 -- has secret accounts in the web that it hides from parents and teachers.
Studying 20,000 high school students showed the increase of Facebook Insta pages
It's the news of fear that there publishes sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a parent's "basic" account.
Every fifth child -- some have only become 11 -- creates an accountant in a web that keeps a secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in Facebook Insta accounts, which would be posted on the Instagram photo exchange website.
It's a news story that's filled with fear that there's a sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they'd have "clean" accounts to show their parents, and they'd also have private accounts.
One mother who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter learned that she had called others "to rape me."
A study conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Company and the conference of independent school directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they won't be found by parents or teachers."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of sportsmen" in Scotland's Easy Athletic Council
Elid Doyle was chosen in the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as the observer member of the council at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled light-year-year-old and senior Ian Biti described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to get a lot of benefit from her experience at different levels, which is an international figure in the last decade.
"The Aid is used with great respect in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's sports community, and we are sure that a lightweight athlete in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council," Biti said.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope that I will help control sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Alps in Atlanta, and another two gold medals in the other alps, and who is now working as an expert on BBC, can't walk after a microsulk has survived.
He wrote on Twitter, "Moon ago, I survived a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only be time to show up, or I would do it, and to what extent.
It was a hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm practicing in the corner!
Thank you for your support message!"
A small pump advertising where mothers compare with cows, shared their views on the Internet
The small-scale pump production company divided the opinion by issuing an advertisement comparing feeding women to breast-feeding women who are breast-feeding.
In order to mark the start of what is called the world's first trusted small pump, the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music advertisement based on video to show the freedom it gives to a nursing mother.
The four true mothers dance in the chorus with the cow under the song, where they have the words, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And she said, Come on, I will feed my children, come on, come on, I will give my women.
However, an advertisement posted on Facebook's website called for a heated discussion on the Internet.
77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments. The response to the video was unmistakable, many said it was a terrible small production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must weigh and order to give milk, here's only their children choosing in a few days," one viewer wrote.
Elvie's baby pump is indiscriminately hidden in a food bottle (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "She understood traumatically both for her mother and for her child.
But why not use them for advertising a small pump for mothers who don't have children?"
Someone said, "That's an unplanned advertisement."
Others defended advertising, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was fun.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have this if I'd chewed on my chest.
Respiration of the milk makes me feel a cow.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun ad directed at a mother that detonates milk pumps (usually at the workplace or in the toilet) and hears themselves as "cows".
It doesn't approve of advertising and does not condemn small-scale industries."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with invisible small pumps hidden in the bistgalts.
The concept of a advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel guilty.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely idle, has no rights, no pipes, and is indiscriminately hidden in the kitchen for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave the house while working the equipment.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a very special and corrective start.
Leading the parallel between feeding women and small cows, we wanted to draw attention to the dissipation of the milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating the fun and pleasant way in which the new small pump takes on the extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvie's small pump is in the center of attention.
During the London fashion week, the mother's two children appeared on the platform in clothes from Martha Jacobowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without a rainy noise carry to a shelter camp on a techno border
Although the number of border crossings in the month has almost changed, there has been a sharp increase in the number of detainees, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Tramp administration, which have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to put their own home in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased considerably in June when the federal authorities announced that a patent sponsor and other senior members of homeowners would have to drop their fingerprints and data would be transferred to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and laundry staff member, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrested agencies of dozens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without assistance.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no senility.
"About 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of their homeowners are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are aliens with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing such people," said Mr. Olbens.
In order to treat children more quickly, scientists introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, because, according to the workers of shelter, they had a standard period of 60 days before.
A large number of people are going to use video-relationships instead of being present in a private court.
Those who are considered helpless will quickly be removed.
According to shelter workers and a message from sources in the system that has appeared in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety that can lead to the outbreak of violence or the attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that in more massive institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much stronger, as the causes of the child being in a state of distress are likely to be ignored by the size of the facility.
They add that moving a child into a residential garden without providing time for emotional preparation or for recreation with friends can worsen the trauma that many have already encountered.
Serbia requires immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey 'occupational forces'
In response to the AAN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Valid al-Mual also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
The speech, which is also the Prime Minister's spokesman, said that foreign forces are on the Syrian land illegally, on the basis of a struggle with terrorism, and 'they will be viewed accordingly'.
"They must go away immediately and without putting any conditions," he said at the assembly's meeting.
The museum insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died in 2011, and millions of people had to leave their homes, “war on terrorism is practically over”.
He announced that Damascus intends to continue to "bear this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "love of illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, there are about 2,000 US soldiers who are mainly involved in the role of instructors and advisors in the Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are in opposition to President Bashar Assad.
France's earthly contingent in this devastated war country consists of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the question of refugees, the Mualam said that the conditions for return were favourable and accused of "some Western countries" in "dispersal of Iranian fears", which contain refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to pass on their return," he says.
"They are policing a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to renew until a political decree on the end of the war is reached between Asadam and the opposition.
The AAN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major resistance of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkey memorial prevented a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia's government, where three million people live.
However, the Mualam stressed that the memorandum had “adequate terms”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the hysteria, including the number of battleheads associated with the Al-Qaida Nusra Front, who would “be destroyed”.
AAN Stefan de Mistour's Ambassador is looking forward to calling for a new committee's first assignment, which includes government and opposition representatives, to develop a post-constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The author stated the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the committee should be limited to "the review of the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against placement.
Why the Tramp would go on a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Tramp will win in the 2020 election when, as many liberal spectators expect, the impression and scandal do not end his presidency indefinitely.
And this will no doubt be "The only dramatic final of the presidency throughout history!"
At this point, there is no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, ratings have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times – up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers per hour, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC channel's "The Rachel Maddow Show" was collected at the screen 3.5 million viewers and exceeded the rating of cable television in the evening when the headlines were broadcast.
"This is a fire to which people are drawn, because we don't understand it," says Neil Beer, director of ABC's drama "Permanent" about the Cabinet member of ministers who become president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scowell, the art of scenic comedy and authors of the book "A couple of funny details and a couple of hard facts about going to the club of Hollywood boys," there's another theory.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Tramp.
- Why? - She asked.
He said, "Because he's making me happy," said Mrs. Scowell to me.
The chaos is even more precious than it can be.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television, the social lines that come out of Washington can become as definite a future as the "Royal Against Wade" case depends on whether the family of immigrants can unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you look at the sixth hour as a group of experts commenting on the use of Bob Woodward's "not for printing" in the book of Strah, the Court of Paul Manafort for $15,000 with strutsy leather (wearing, wearing pride, as written in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the harsh descriptions of Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it comes out of a simple framework of desire to be in the course of the race.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria as much as I used to.
"A bit of what he does makes you feel so, if you look at the reality of the show he shows every evening," says Brand Montgomery, running director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing art of the Tramp show and the constant turnings of the ally (Sparing) with NFL, approval by Kim Chen.
You can't let yourself miss even one episode, or you'll stay out of the market.
When I spoke to Mr. Fles this week, behind the windows of his house on the north shore of the Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and looked at the MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not give up, not when Brett Cavan got up before the Senate's judicial committee, considering the future of the Divine Court, which hung on a hair.
"I remember girls when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

External cash flows fall into a severe pre-selective race of interim elections in the House of Representatives
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania's 17th election district has set up a cash fair, thanks to the change in the boundaries of Congress's districts, two candidates participate in the elections in one place.
A recently repatriated rural district of Pizzburg surrounds a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives Konar Lemba, who won his place in another district in the wake of last spring.
Lembo is opposed to another acting MP, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the new 17th.
The cards were repatriated after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in November, which said that the voices of the old areas were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the republics.
The pre-election race in the new 17th round has led to a decline in the financing of the company by the main parties' financial groups, the Democratic Group's Congress Committee (CCC) and the National Republican Company's National Committee (NCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory over a wide range of sanctified statues in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by the Republic for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point strike round.
Political experts have a small advantage over the democrats.
The United States assessed the possibility of El Salvador's punishment in support of China, and then withdrew.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing, despite a minor confrontation on the part of Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Karlas Varela, in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners moved to the Tromp Command.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," President Hezer Nawert of the State Department said in the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were considered only in the case of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on issuing visas, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In response to the completion of the internal meeting, North and Central American representatives postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated security and economic prosperity, which would continue to be an analogous meeting in the past year, which was assessed as a step towards preventing immigration in the United States.
But by the middle of the fall, the high-level representatives of the administration continued to realize that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped the discussion of the question of Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension will now take part in a conference, which will be held in mid-October, in the sign that the administration is in charge of entrepreneurship.
And three U.S. envoys without a rainstorm returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new cruel sendings or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been described by three American scholars, including the number of two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while preserving anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by others, close to the administration of analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible obstacles to the justice of Mr. Tramp, for examples of what is currently very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Muller drew attention to the investigation of the possibility of a campaign of the Trump and Russia in an attack on the election.
When Congress changes the master, Mr. Tramp appears before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he attempts to speak before the electors again, and perhaps eventually before the jury of his fellow.
There's a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that Mr. Tramp's fall is inevitable, just like he's in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the struggle will take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for the coup against Hitler, if only the West had told him against and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to escape the coming years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such fractured moments, and the unmistakable march of democracy shrinks or retreats.
Right now the Americans have met with a few of these fractures.
What happens when Mr. Tramp disbands General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about what he had suggested last year to write the president's words in secret and considered his impartiality.
Mr. Rosenstein says the translation "The Times" is not correct.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation of Brett Kavana's case is not arbitrary or just, or if it is confirmed in the Criminal Court, despite the fact that it is worth believing in sexual violence and inconsistencies?
And first of all, will we vote in favour of Congress, which will attract Mr. Tramp to responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests, the long winter will come to democracy.
But I believe we won't give thanks for the lesson I took in Prague.
My mother was a Czech beaver who had been deported in Asvenci in the same Nazi regime that once bought my post office.
She survived, played in America, and after 60 years she sent me to burn the Sabbath candles on this table with the Easter.
With such a legacy as I can't be an optimist in relation to our future?"
Norman Ezeen, senior scientific associate of the Brookings Institute, head of the "Gradian for Responsibility and Ethics" organization from the D.C. headquarters and author of the book "Last Palace: a violent century of Europe in five lives and one legendary house."
Graham Dorans from Rangers is an optimist front-end match from Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians after an impressive thing in Spain over William in the beginning of this month will certainly allow them to leave the G League of Europe.
The trombone of the trombone prevented the half-spinning of Greme Dorans for the first time to take place in the season before night 2-2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Randers" could be used as a trampline.
"It was an important match for us, because "Vilaireal" is a strong opponent," considers a 31-year-old footballer.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and got a point.
Maybe at the end we could kill the ball, but the whole thing also turned out to be a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves into our hands, and we had the best half field.
On Thursday there will be another important one for European football night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it's going to be a complicated game, as they've shown a good result in the last game, but, counting the crowd of notifiers on the courts, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was determined hard, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor in certainty.
Good command, and the boys really get the pleasure of the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, achieve the result of the past season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents had an accurate understanding of what they wanted for themselves, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the global research reported that they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of "Nationwide" for life insurance.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Observe this with your husband and children: your family will not be prepared to help you if you are confused not to heed your wishes.
Work with the consultant and the family and consider where and how to get medical help, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Take a look at the financial consultant's discussion. He can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps to cover these expenses or you can guarantee your life on your own – provided you have money.
Deal with legal documents: provide court battles.
Get a period on medical care to assign a period of time to control your medical care and to ensure that your specialist needs are met if you cannot talk.
Consider, too, the possibility of spending trust in financial management.
Select the person you want to run to make financial decisions and make sure you pay your bills if you are inactive.
Don't forget about the details: Imagine that your old father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about forbidden drugs and the presence of allergies?
Enter these details in writing to be ready.
"It's not only a financial issue but also a medical professionalism," Martin adds.
"What medicines are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything."
In Ilfracombe in a man several times shot with a pneumatic guitar
The man got a couple of seizures with a pneumatic guitar when he was walking home at night.
About 40 years ago, it was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when it was shot in his chest, his life and his hand.
Police officers described a shooting that took place at about 02:30 a.m. local time as an "accidental event".
Patience was not seen by the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police ask a witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the official, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, and is expected to be the number of deaths.
Because of the disconnection of the relationship between the figures involved in humanitarian aid, they couldn't get any information from Dongal's regency, the area north of Paul, which is closer to the 7.5 ball earthquake epidemic.
In Pala, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a stressful disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slovene:
Paulo is the capital of central Slovenia, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding.
Dongala is a regency located over 180 miles (300 km) of the coastal line on the north-west of the island of Sulavesi.
Regency is an administrative unit lower than government, with a total of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and rural landowners are the main economics of central Slovenia, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for governance, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Slovenia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction, Paul and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people died in Dongal from tsunamis, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and its regular rocking of earthquakes.
The following list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indian Ocean in the north of Sumatra on 26 November called for tsunamis, which hit 14 countries, resulting in the loss of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the Aegean.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes turned to the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March-earth.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nis, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 occurred on the south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, calling for tsunamis on the south coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: In the town of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatran Empire, an earthquake hit 7.6 degrees.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the Isles of Mentawa outside of Sumatra, calling for tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake turned to the Regency of Susie Jay in the Achee region, causing destruction and panic, as he reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunamis.
This time the tsunamis didn't come, but over 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: strong earthquakes have turned to the tourist islands of Indonesia Lambok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.
The old son of Sarah Paylin arrested for domestic violence in the family
The track Paylin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president of Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin of Vasil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted the information about domestic violence and the opposition of the arrest published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of the acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Palin is located in the next Matanuska-Sustaint island on the basis of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he reported to himself "precisely innocent," when he was asked whether he would admit his guilt, the network reported.
Paleline is accused of three Class A violations, which threatens to free him up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day-to-day release and a fine of $200.
This is not the first case when the charges against Pailin were brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is now at the trial of the Alaskan vets' court.
In November 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of reporting domestic violence and of maintaining arms in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for her son’s harsh conduct with a post-traumatic syndrome called for by his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunamis: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The Earthquake forces 7.5 ball called the tsunamis and broke down thousands of houses.
Electricity and networks are not working, and it is expected that the number of victims will grow in the coming days.
The Earthquake took place not far from central Slovenia, which is located on the north-east east of the capital of Jakarta.
Social networks have distributed video clips that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala, when the tsunamis swept over the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office rarely requires a death sentence for a suspect in a New York City trial.
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is charged with the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipaw, 30 years old, appears to have been used in October by the Home Depot freighter for a ride on a six-way highway along the West-Said in Lower Manhattan, breaking down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the report of the intention to seek a death sentence in the South York District, the prosecutors must prove that Saipah "strikingly" killed eight people and "strikingly" caused serious serious damage.
According to the court's materials, for both violations, the possible penalty as a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the large federal jury is tracking Saipov's missile charges of 22 items that included eight charges for the murder of the missile; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges for violence and the destruction of transport funds.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required "old-fashioned and deliberate planning", and describing Saipov crimes, they used such phrases as "aggressive, harsh and dissuasive".
"Syful Habibuleevich Saipov caused trauma, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lora Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferro, Erna Diego Mendes and Alejandro Damien Pgnuk," said in a statement of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with a sentence like a death penalty in the South of New York it's been ten years.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to death two years earlier for the purpose of spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenbergs was sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipa, a fugitive from Uzbekistan, according to the court documents, demonstrated that there were no sentences of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said as follows that he felt satisfaction from his grandson.
As a result of the prosecution's arrest, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired by the video viewer of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also requested permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room, reported to the police.
He won't accept himself guilty of an indictable conclusion, which consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov, said they were "indiscriminately disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than the benefit of imprisonment without the possibility of redemption, is only to prolong the pain of these events for all participants," said Patan.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
A member of the Torah Parliament says that Nigel Faraj should mark the Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at the Tory's conference, Nigel Faraj was about to "mobilize the people's army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "hear discomfort" from Eurosceptics – as one of the members of the Terezia Parliament proposed my candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of Parliament from the Conservative party Peter Bowe said during a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" if Mr. Faraj had borrowed the estate of a shoemaker on Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May encountered, trying to imitate her different supporters, was even worse when the Thores, who advocated the preservation of EU membership, made a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to preserve a Compromised Checker's Message under constant pressure from supporters and workers of departure, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force the Eurosceptics and the Librists to choose between the package and the "disaster".
Master Boun said at a meeting in Salihalle, "Getting out" (Leave Means Leave), which wants to "remove the Checker from the board".
He suggested that Mr. Faraage do the same and set up duties for talks with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have come out," he said.
A member of Parliament from Velingbor said, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get out of the Czech Plan."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We do not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country."
Master Boone rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is not entirely true."
Brexit's supporter and Thora's member, Andrea Jenkins, was also on March, and in conversation with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czech plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out and pick us out.
Please turn down the plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Mrs. May she added, "The Prime Ministers remain on the passport when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians need to feel “discomfort” when they are going to betray a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us – people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "It's not going to go out of your hand."
In return to the excited crowd he added: "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brixit feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us victory in Britain, and we will never be satisfied until we become independent, self-concealed, proud United Kingdoms."
At the same time, the officers went out through Birmingham before they could hold a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists were discussing the Tories Against Brexit (Tori vs. Brexit) banners after the group started in these outputs.
The Liberian Per Lord Adonis met with the chance of a security problem with which they met from the evening program at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technologies for Canada plus, for limitless trains, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
Such a thing as a good Brexit. There is no one," he added.
Warren is planning to pay close attention to the President's seat.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the election in November, she "will pay close attention to the process of the President's seat."
"The Boston Globe" reports that the D.A. from Massachusetts on Saturday told us about its future during the general march in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Tramp, is going to go to re-election, against a member of the Republic's Jeff Dil Party, who was an aggravating Tromp company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of the discussion as the possible opponent of the Trump in 2020.
Since the time of the Tramp on the landing it was already 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a general east, which took place on Saturday in Halifax.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to take the president's seat.
Warren replied that the time had come for a woman to go to Washington to correct a broken government, and for this to happen, there must be a woman."
The arrest took place after the death of the basketball player, Sims, from Louisiana State University.
The Baton-Ruz Police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the assassination of a basketball player, the Wyde Sims, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton-Roz police officer announced the 20-year-old Dietan Simpson's arrest at a press conference that took place at 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday, they published a video shoot with a request to help identify the person who was figuring it out.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot by the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
"Wayd Sims got a gunshot wound in his head as a result of his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to reporters on Saturday's "247sports" channel.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of Simpson's investigation he admitted that he was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken under guard in the police station's east-Bonton-Ruz district.
A sportsman grew 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) in Baton-Roz, Sams last season played in 32 games, 10 of which were on the square from the beginning, in the middle of a 17.4 minute square, dropped 5.6 points and took 2.9 teams for the game.
Grant to Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion after having gained victory over Sebastian Fetel in an internal case
From the moment that Walter Bots on Saturday attended Louis Hamilton's qualification, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes inside command play a significant role in the race.
Botts pulled a good spot on the barber and almost left Hamilton at the will of the forest, while he defended his place on the first two visions and invited Fetel to attack his friend by command.
The fattel first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton kneeling at the end of the common mass of chickens, namely this maneuver had to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to the pit-step later and went out behind the Fetel, but Hamilton went out after several round-to-round maneuvers, which forced the driver of the Ferrari to leave the inner space free, risking being held after a double maneuver to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstappen, on his 21st day of birth, started from the back of the network, and by the end of the first round, he was in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, while holding the shadows, for he wanted to finish quickly, wrap Kimmy Ryconen and take the fourth place.
As a result he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but could not increase speed on the other eight rounds, so Ryan took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Walter all the outgoing spoke fantastically and said to himself a true gentleman, if I were allowed to say so.
"The team has tried the election to take the first and second seats," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad language of the body
President Donald Tramp laughed Senator Dean Finestein at a meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the escape letter from Christian Blaze Ford, in which she accused a candidate of being a member of the Brett Kawan Supreme Court in sexual violence.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the indications given to Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, noting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "slow, hateful and unfair".
"The only thing that can happen, and then it's beautiful what's going on in the last few days in the Senate, is if you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and false people," he said.
"If you read about press releases and escapes, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, is that your flight?
Remember her answer... you lost the document - "Oh, oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
We let go... no, we didn't,' he added, advising the senator.
Phoenix in July sent a letter with a detailed explanation of the charges brought against Kavana by Ford, and he ran away from the beginning of September--but Finnstein refused that the flight had taken place from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her stories run away," said the Phoenix Committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her rejection probably didn't like the president who so recommended it during the Saturday meeting: "That's what I'm going to tell you, it was a really bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
In continuing the defense of a candidate in the Supreme Court charged with sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the democrats use charges for their own purposes.
"They are full of decisions to return to power by any means.
You see the authority, the measure, and they're the ones they're hurting, the ones they're going to have to go through to get power and control," says the President Mediaite.

Strong underground strikes continue, and many people buried under the clouds in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues were rescued by fugitives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his estate at a disparate height, which the savage was waiting for at the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the ship of 6321 Batik Air, which was at that moment in the airfield, had been disembarked from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the dyspnoea when he decided that she was breaking up.
Later he died in the hospital.
As reported by the Australian ABC News, the Air Navigation Indonesia representative Yohanès Sirita, the dissident's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balicapapan on Kalimantan, which had to be transported to a more massive hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter drove to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities of countries are afraid that the number of victims can reach a few thousand, while the agencies to reduce the threat of austerity claim that access to the town of Dongal, Sigi and Boston is limited.
A representative of Sotopa Purva Nugroh's agency said, "Perhaps the number of victims is still increasing, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig out from under the fractures."
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Paul, where on Sunday there will be a mass burial.
Vulnerable and commercial planes are carrying humanitarian aid.
Russ Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, reported "Sky News": "Every minute a car "fast" brings the body.
Clear water does not boil.
They're doing stores everywhere."
Jan Helfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported "CNN": "Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help those who have survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it can all get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Jack Oodda, came to Paul on Sunday and said to the soldiers, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" - informs CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, she had suffered earthquakes in Lamboke, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: One man went missing after a plane crash in the pond
The airline that carried out the voyage, which made an accident landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously confirmed that all 47 passengers and teams were successfully evacuated from the flying aircraft that was flying, and now it claims to be missing without the information of one passenger.
Air Niugini's company said in press release that on Saturday she could not report the location of one male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospital staff, and others to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane landed on the water while trying to land at the island of Cuckoo airport.
On Friday, the official persons reported that seven people had been in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday; they were all stable.
The cause of the breach, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
According to both airlines and the U.S. V.S.S.S.S., the plane landed in the pond without moving to the landing area.
The message from some witnesses, the plane jumped into the landing field.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It worked very well," reported Janes.
According to him, he and the others were able to go through the field in the water to the crash exits of the plane, which had already danced.
He said that the shipyards had panicked and began to shout, as well as that he had got a little headache.
The U.S.A. reports that the sailors, who camped a nearby port, also helped to rescue by using an unusual boat for transporting people on the beach until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in violation of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea for the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analytical renews the course of events at night when the woman was burned by the animal
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning the residents of Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Roulette, for a few hours, showed himself as an attractive expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phones to recognize the movement of 29-year-old Quentan Tellis and 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers at her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Roulette said, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous announcement.
When it was reported that his cell phone was near the Chambers' phone at a time when, according to his statement, he was with his friend Michael Jennifer confirmed, the police were directed to invite Jennifer.
Jennifer gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he had not been in town.
When the side of the charge asked whether Tellis was telling the truth about the fact that Sanford was in the van that evening, he said that he was “misleading, as my van was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, she deleted her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He cut her off from her life," Haley said.
The side of the defense must begin the sides of the conflict on Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that same day.

Artists such as Akala and Lowkey, returned to a collection such as The Fugees and Commons, popularity in the United Kingdom.
Another blacksmith?!
She from New York falls in court for a marriage couple for a "racist" post-release message.
She from New York falls in court for a marriage mate for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a random message sent by her mother with a complaint that she is “one more black.”
The couple rejects that they are racists, balancing the call to "responsibility."
In 2016, the mother of two children, Linsie Plasca-Flexman, expressed disappointment, finding that the new bride, Giselle Moris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
“Neeeeeee, another one of the kings,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flackman in her husband’s message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent Miss Morris' message.
As reported by New York Post, understanding the mistake, the Flashman’s “inability” was released by Miss Morris, claiming that the previous girl, who was also African, was ill at work, and that she was waiting for her Filipino instead.
Miss Morris paid the day off and sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is a couple in court and wants to get a payout compensation in accordance with the conditions on which she was first hired, even without contract: $350 a day for six months with a living.
"I want to show them what they can't do," she said on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refused to accuse her of racism, asserting that the release of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after being injured.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist,' said the Postman Joel Plaska.
"And would you trust your children to whom you have been rude, even by chance?
Your granddaughter?
Isn't it?"
The plane parallels the call to "requirement" and reports that his wife was born two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you pursue a man in such a position?
It's pretty hard," added the investment-banking specialist.
Although the judiciary is still continuing, the public opinion quickly condemned the marriage couple in social networks, which has severely criticised their behavior and logic.
The editors of the Song of Solomon warned that readers will not be opposed to the media that speaks in a new sheet
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born soon after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "The difficulty is to put herself in the place of the one who reads it first before it is published.
So interesting it is to read, already knowing of the great success of Podington."
She said that her father, who worked for the BBC operator before he had to write a book for the children about a small rat bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work had not been accepted and added that the 60th edition of the book was a "worn sweet" after his death in the past year.
She added that her father quietly was proud of his final success, speaking of the Podington, which she describes as "very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and quite unexposed," she said.
"But since Podingtan was so real to him, it was almost a parent's honour for a child that was demanded of: thou shalt be proud of them, though in fact it is not thy merit.
I think he was considering the success of Podington in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave due respect to the subject."
My daughter died, and I had to develop with her on the phone
After her daughter was laid, she was delivered to Niky Louis Pastera's 2 hospital, where the doctors struggled slowly for her life.
"Now she phoned regularly to tell me that it was really bad that she didn't stand," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then I called Nad to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to deal with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave her heart to run away, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was going on there.
I couldn't stand, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because there were family and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperus, who survived the loss of a daughter, took the village on a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know at all what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I leaned my head and my face all the time ran out of tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was in the field that I was caught by the feeling of Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are sad to wear cards to warn of suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do all they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey take the cards off with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help on the bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when his depression began, and at the age of 18, he died of suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I do," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a talented boss with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew his smile.
People said that his smile would illuminate any room."
However, before he died, he quit work because he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body when he died of suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I am constantly worried that this can be unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis created a card, "that people would know that there are people in the world that you can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Hasfres, who has been dating Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that," she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the solemn day he was very upset: when the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but there was a need to live with it: "In the family there was a great hole.
It just kills us.
But you have to keep on living and fighting."

Brett Cavano is uncertain, as the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought we could have what he wants – limited in time and in time and in time of research – we could get a little union," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "dissolved" because of what actually happened in the sample.
Why doesn't Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their passions are sometimes interpreted.
The interim elections in five weeks, November 6th -- when the Republics are expected to suffer at once, then they will be weakened in their efforts to choose in the Supreme Court what they need a candidate.
George Bush called the senator to negotiate Mr. Cavano's support, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Until it became clear whether Mr. Cavano would have received at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of the balance of votes and to confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen under Kima's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South fell since Kim Chen came to power seven years ago, a South Korean soldier said.
Bo Sun, bringing the South Korean Ministry data to the union, said last year there were 1127 refugees, and in 2011, 2706.
Master Park has stated that the main reasons are the strengthened border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that have been incurred by the smugglers for the refurbishment.
Phen'an didn't comment on it at all.
Most of the refugees from the north with what they get the citizens of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea is the longest border. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very close to each other.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often reports them.
The relationship between North and South -- which is technically still in the war -- has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of two countries met in Phenyan to talk about denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Inn in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work with the aim of completely disbanding the Korean nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Jan Ho accused American sanctions in the absence of progress since that time.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such conditions we will not be going to disarm the first," said Mr. Ry in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Cavano "a hysterical," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate at the Brett Kavana Warehouse "histories" and said that, in his temper, he did not fit for the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Ostin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called an "historic," said Pelosi about his reaction to the talk of Kawano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano was emotionally charged with sexual harassment by Dr. Cristina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his opening talk, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and couldn't talk when his family and the senior classes were protesting.
He also strongly accused the Democratics in committee, calling charges against his "gratcal and organised killings", organized by the liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
The speakers said that they thought that the speech of Cavano showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly showed that he had the advantage of being against the democrats.
"I think he has discredited himself with his statements and the manner in which he was talking about the client and the democrats," she said.
Pelosy stopped when she was asked if she would try to impress Cavano when he was chosen and the democrats got most of the representatives in the House.
"I'll say so – if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not only supposed to be working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelozy.
At this point Kawano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about the potential solutions of Kawano against the law of medical availability or the Raw case against Wade, because Kawano was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings after the confirmation of the pass, the Kawano did not answer the questions, or he would cancel certain decisions of the Vocational Court.
"Now is not the time for aesthetic, non-objective individuals to work in court and wait for us to say, 'How wonderful,'" said Pelozy.
And the woman must be able to do it.
It's a valid criminal speech, months and years of anger just melt away, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," 45 years ago, Mrs. Steine told me.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She went on to say, "I had a lot of help from a woman who worked for the director, and who said that when she got caught, she was crying, but she was working on the behavior technique, and when she got caught up and started crying, she said to the interviewer, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are allowed partly as an exit of the sum, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first job I once cried out of unmistakable wickedness, then I was caught by an old woman's captor -- a apprehended chief who always scared me a little--and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you in the tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be glad that has given you."
Patriot Schroeder, at the time the co-democratic from Calarad, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got married on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of a presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder's very angry thought that she and she could be part of the presidential company.
"It was not a very well thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I didn't need them at all.
Someone called this situation "The Beast and Seven Gnoms."
Since the company had been going long enough, it didn't have the means, so she said it wouldn't be a choice if it didn't take $2 million.
It was a bad situation.
It turns out that some of her supporters, who sacrificed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm going with a drop?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election, she was so deeply touched by emotion -- thanks to the people who supported her -- by the system that made it so difficult to get money and directed to the voters rather than to the candidates, and by the anger of sexism -- that she was overhaled.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder in her response to the press.
"It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor was the producer of Kleenex paper screws.
I used to think that they were writing on my supermotive stone?
"She cried?"
Why trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first wave of trade wars between China and the United States were absurd, and since war is far from over, in a far more distant prospect of misunderstandings between countries can be for the benefit of Beijing, experts say.
The president of the United States, Donald Tramp, fired the first warning this year, taxing China's main export companies, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs dropped the total amount of $200 billion (150 billion) by taxing half of the goods in the United States of America from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, raising recent tariffs from five to ten percent on American ships at $60 billion.
China's fans in the United States have a symmetrical answer, and the second in terms of economy will hardly lead to an eye.
To force Washington to retreat, we have to step into demand, but the public tendency towards the United States is practically unacceptable for China's leader Si Xinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the U.S. trade pressure in a far-reaching perspective can sustain China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than observers have thought before," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, at the research-analytical centre of new American security.
Syrian "prepared" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
The Syrian states that it is ready to return refugees and calls for assistance in the construction of a war-damaged country that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the AAN Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualam said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and guided economic measures that were directed towards improving their daily lives and means of living.
ANAN believes that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly take help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that the country would not receive help in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from the country that sponsored the mediators.
Europe has won the Battle of Rider in Paris
The European team won the Riyadh Cup in 2018, winning an American team of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the province of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already played six times on European soil and has not won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the crown even when the command of the Dutch captain Thomas Brennan picked up 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who fought most at the tournaments, threw his ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16th-longs, and stepped down this match of French millinarians.
The Italian golfer, Malinari, played well on all rounds, being one of the four players who passed this field with the number 5-0-0 from the beginning of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Schsch was kicked out by 5 and 4 players with the lowest ratings in the European team, Thornborn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most popular player, lost 2 and 1 Ien Poulter from England, who was probably playing in his last cup of Riyadh.
The Veteran Eight-Cube Rider Spanish Serhia Garcia became a player who has won more than all the tournaments with a career of 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get back the cube.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad it could help,' said the excited Garcia after the European team won.
He handed over the esophagus to his landman John Ram, who won the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single match of 2&1.
"I am very proud of what I won in Tiger Woods, the man who was behind the career that he had since childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his balls in France, and now my record number is 13-21-3 in Ryder's cup.
The amazing statistics of one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 headlines and stays on this indicator only from Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with it, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tni Finov, who played the whole tournament of high-class golf.
U.S. Captain Jim Fury said after a desperate game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're battles.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what it is capable of.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Riyadh Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take the hat off before them.
We've been moved."
