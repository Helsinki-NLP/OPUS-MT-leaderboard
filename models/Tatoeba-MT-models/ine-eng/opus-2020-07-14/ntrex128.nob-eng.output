Welsh Members do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Wallisian National Assembly, known today as the AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the national assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this could lead to a ridiculous outcome.
A representative from the Labour Party explained that his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "duste", and pwp means "bj".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "discontented" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walysian part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the name change, but noting that the MWP’s statement is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Walysian letter W is spoken in a similar way as the letter U is spoken in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right of destination in respect of which name they are to be mentioned.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that showed general support for reviving the national assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives supported by the WMP Commission (Welsh Parliament Members), the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose a number of other options, but getting all parties to reach an agreement can lead to the heads of Parliament's President Elin Jones, who will, as planned, deliver a legislative draft for the amendment of the name in the next few weeks.
The legislation on the reform will include other changes in the functioning of the national assembly, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the right to vote on what they should be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the elections to determine whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their name should be changed to ‘the Republic of North Macedonia’.
The public vote is held in an attempt to resolve a ten-year dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has, for several reasons, opposed the country's application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is quite simply the price they have to pay to get involved in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence – the screams in Harlem heal
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that before the time there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the bartender's departure was understandable.
“People are being socialized in other ways” to date, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe: «And before or after they are back at the beginning».
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining spaces.
“Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both screams were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodological unit moved out in the 1930s.
A black crowd who had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black crowd under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main agents – because they refused to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Johnson’s son-in-law made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the father of Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of which have been initiated by the church's legislatorship and others by the bishop.
The Council of the Church – the head of the community, consisting of legislators – wrote to the Bishop in July of its concern that the Bishops came to ‘try to impose the costs’ on the Council of the Church, despite the fact that the Council of the Church had not been involved in the induction of the architects or contractors sent by the Bishops.
Some sleepy children complained of lack of openness on the part of the bishop.
Hai damages thirty-year-olds on hamsters in California
A hilarious attack and damage to a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy shouted out of curiosity about having caught a lobster, but he realized after that the boy called 'I was bited!
I was bitten!'»
His whole neck was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' ""
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that committed the attack is not known.
The bathroom captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its way into Britain's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with goods-like jewelry and beauty care pills, the staff of specially trained employees.
The extended shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK's 2.8 million beauty care market, which is still growing while the sales figures for clothing and household items fall. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will be extended to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the efforts of the supermarket to find a new area of use for the place previously used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybellline, and Burt's Bees will also get a better place in noted brands, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also renews its Boutique retail brand with mainly vegan products, as demand for this is growing among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out a table in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online trade and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local retail stores means that the supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's said that the auctions will each look more and more like a product store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl stores with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a series of Habitat sales after having purchased both chains two years ago.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after an alarming distribution of the income from the apothecaries in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store portfolios to Celesio, owned by Lloyd's Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury leather players, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care boxes to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be so prepared to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environments and practical locations make us now a beauty-care competitor that represents a new business experience.»
Peter Jones is "resolved" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million.
Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones must be angry after the TV star Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home brand, True.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the program leader in this Morning, at Instagram, announced that she was leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last seconds to focus on their own new golden-looking contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says that Jones was “rare” at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the golden wave of television admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time left for their clothing and accessories brand, True.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave True, she left Jones the United Kingdom on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decade.
Everyone's totally shocked that she's chosen to move.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, which is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this Morning programmer, one of the most popular stars in the UK, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as butter and light, butter and ice cream, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Your mother-in-law Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the governing body in March.
The two couples travel together, and Jones has 40% ownership of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand-name ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said yesterday 'We will not comment on his business dealings'.
Chefs «and then we fell in love»
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media in order to have a comment some would consider as 'little president' and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after having declared themselves that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear destruction by North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear destruction have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a ‘response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead the United States still has sanctions designed to keep the press up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke of a collection of his electors.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
"We kept going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a competitive relationship."
He said that his work to improve Kim's relationship has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helping to get rid of hostages and getting the lives of American service people sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to act with the presidency, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this progressive arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed to the area right in front of us.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an island and take the lives of hundreds of people
In the cold water of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident ideal organisations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of the inhabitants of Lomboks had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international aid, so it is quite challenging," Sumbung explained.
Save children now put together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national crisis management stage, said that the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the assistance work.
Given the constant exposure to the earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death rates.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the end of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made an upgrade of Indonesia's fallen infrastructure to a major point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and the railways.
But money shortages have been a major problem for the Yokos administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone into a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than a thousand had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims reproduce locks in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.

The attempt went high above the box, while the ball dropped against the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and crashed into the net.

Police arrest man (32) for killing after a woman is stabbed to death
A killer research has started after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was attacked, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We're all at the beginning of the investigation, but I'd like to ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially the Drossier, who may have caught something on his car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police officer confirmed that the dead woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim.
A dreary driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interviewed, telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a resort.
A grueling woman appeared at the gate.
She repeats "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars behind the lockdown, while a third a car was outside.
A number of police officers were outside the lockdown and had an overview of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last monument that has been brought into the 'rewrite history' cry.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious taxes carried out by his fanatic Puritan supporters.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's version as "stupid" and "a attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The iconoclass of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's fault will be punished for the sins of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s' opinions and is part of historiography for a man many still deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, as Parliament's defense against the outside press – in his day it was of course the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate representation, it is still the subject of a historic debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Killer Griss Take Life From Chinese Bond
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on his market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only after the name ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a broken pulse year near a bond on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place vaccines on pigs on a farm in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China on 30 May 2005.
He had to travel with his aunt from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the fatter found him dead, and discovered that the door to a nearby pigpath was open.
He said inside the pig's path it was a big mess with blood on his mouth.
A medical study confirmed, according to the report, that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
«The bones of my fat were bloody and maltreated» explained the fat, referred to by the last name Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Eventing News.
Recordings from the surveillance chamber showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his stepfather.
While the police together prove from the court, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
The Yuan family and the management of the market are negotiating a number of compensations for the death.
Although this is the case, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and inflicted serious damage on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Walysian peasant was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until his wife was able to hunt the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
"From the heart.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show adequate respect.’»
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the Southwest USA
As reported, the hurricane Rosa is weakened, moving over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take a river trail on her trip through North Mexico and South-West USA over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind power of 135 km/h and was an hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train begins to be formed across the Pacific and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. The Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north towards the Southwest USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, the cooperation between tropical humidity and the drought that is approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west in the next days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flow, liquid noise and rapid and possible earthquakes in the desert.
The diptropic humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west country, in particular over large parts of Arizona.
It is possible for rivers with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert of foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain may lead to eels becoming wide-blowing eels, and the soil will lead to local windfalls that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching drought will result in local strong rainforests for parts of the coast along the South-California.
Total rainfall of more than 1,3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid noise and speed, as well as smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the area.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropicals are very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the central-US on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern USA will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high on the 20th from Southern Plains to parts of North-East USA.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather report indicates that the East-US will most likely have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, saw Thursday's overwhelming testimony from the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political campaign continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual broadcasts to announce the great surprise of Friday in the last seconds, when it was found that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he be 100 percent sure that this didn't happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seer number was not immediately available for other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen tends to have problems measuring offices.
In order to give a little perspective, this number is equal to the final game in American football championship or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose speakers have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average number of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
The office of the moderate Republican came with an opinion that he came to vote in favour of Kavanaugh. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras, trying to take the lift to a meeting in the court committee while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes while he was released, while the event was sent directly to the CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling us the truth?"
He was told that "you have the power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office had come with an opinion, and said that the heating doors had closed that he had come to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, as the court committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the whole Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said that he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to drive "political games" with Britain's future and undermine the nation's interests.
UK Minister of State Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the side of her own on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called 'Checkers' plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was 'all ridiculous'.
Wade Sims shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and intended for deliberate murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
The police found the glasses at the station and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he agreed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350 000, according to The Lawyers.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a shooting year in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group for the acquisition of refugees, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contributions to the research that led to an attack.
LSU’s sports leader Joe Alleva thanks to the police force of the area for its ‘hard work and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "knush" and "in shock" after Wayne's death.
"This is what we fear forever," said Wade.
Volcanic spruce ash over Mexico City
The ashes that are spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southernmost neighbours in Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Preventción de Disasters, Mexico’s public climate for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity was in crested and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within one day.
The diet monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Photos of social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighboring areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered an increase in activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after independence protestors had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising release vote.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombed them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Hand-held also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independent demonstrators called "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with Unionist demonstrators called "Long live Spain".
Forty people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but the celebration of separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming deal of redemption, but it was a poor appeal because the vote was boycotted by most of those who opposed the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Release groups lie on the streets at night to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy about getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems maintaining the pressure this year, after many of their well-known leaders have travelled in self-declared exile or are in storage while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was issued by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison pending a case late in the fourth year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To be elected as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and discipline of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years have been arrested after driving a car several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the port and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been driven against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first target for Livingston secured lake
I was surprised by the excitement of Livinston Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good encounter from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the road in the Premier League this season and is going to play against the Hearts leaders, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home match against Rapid Wien in Europe on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has kept the subsisting through six fights in the division. Chief Strell Holt has not yet lost a fight since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for his blind guests
Holt's laws should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bombed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the pushed forward after stepping in to meet Craig Halket's head over the target.
The company let Rangers play in front of themselves, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at deathball.
And that's how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave off a fresh park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a target from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had been very busy all the time, but the housekeeper's defense had turned out to be immeasurable and targeted Liam Kelly had a little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a nearby score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a short walk.
Crusades still came into the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal demands – once after Halket's protest against the intruder Glenn Middleton, and once for hand – were ignored.
‘Penomenal’ from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alaskar Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were all fantastic together, and they continue to pass all expectations on the way up.
The style of the game and the human race have barely changed since they came to the top again, but Holt must have a lot of honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organised defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on to the hills throughout the battle.
Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to sign with.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they were unable to live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labyrinth – they only came into the home track half once – and it was a bit of a pick-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a division of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open an enormous new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police reported security as the reason that a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also heard fate, criticizing both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a whole of some German Turks and hated as an autocrat of others.
Deptford collision: Cyclists killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the crossroads between Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford southeastern town, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the bicycle was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a drive where the driver escaped from the custody of Childrens Street, about a mile from the robbery of the slave.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the victims.
Roadblocks and buses are in place, and drivers are the Council to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in hostages
Six prison officials have been injured in an incident by a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Breaks broken out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still going on.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ officers are collected to handle the event, involving eight intruders and limited to one fly.
The officials were treated for minor facial damage on site.
One person for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind lockdown and knock.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called up to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiards.
The Orkanen Rosa truer Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with river (can be favourable to drought areas)
It is the fault of Arizona being hit by a tropical low pressure, but it is likely to happen early next week, as the hurricane's remaining power moves through the deserts of the south-west and leads to floods.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainforest will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "Third tropical cyclones have maintained the status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The latest National Hurricane Center models provide 5-10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm of individual sites in the Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, will likely reach between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the riverbank, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flood is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, since the South-West US is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the next highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits Rosa land at the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has the power of Sunday morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets cold waters in the Pacific Ocean, and it loses its power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storms Monday night or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be strong and lead to great fluctuations.
‘The total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a capacity of up to 25 cm rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it reaches the border of Arizona gracefully Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main risk expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very severe rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rivers and liquid streams and rapids in the desert and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Killing Trials
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are attacked, suspected of killing, after a 16-year-old was found the knife in Somerset.
The teenage fat was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition must be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were attacked during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who may have cell phone records of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered from the "littleness and the mind" of the democratic party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the thoughtless and shocking tactics of the democratic party," Trump said in front of a People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "belonged to the minority and the mind" to the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the congress on Thursday, and denied strongly and emotionally charged by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago, as they were teenagers.
Ford is also testified on his charge at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, beautiful and brave" was that day.
"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most powerful lawyers of our time, with free public service pay," he told a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats have the objective of "resisting and preventing".
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Several hundred deaths of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were taken out to sea by huge waves that turned against the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had flocked to a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves drenched in the country around the sunset, swept everything in its way and dragged many into the printing death.
The Tsunami came in the heels on an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people still run with activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s crisis management agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
«Tsunami was not alone – it drove with it cars, stems and houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Someone climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management seat showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After that, the coastal town continued to grow on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be estimated by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's state of assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of the friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the floor.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The remains of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the fatalities and injuries could be the greater coast of the country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely distorted, completely without information’ from Dongala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Red Cross in a press release, and let their staff and volunteers be on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, it was strongly criticised for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man at the top floor of a building called desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching the passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water descends towards the beach, raining with its buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power breach that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuations still have desperate needs for food and other needs.
The city’s airport is open only for assistance work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death rates after tsunami in Indonesia rise above 800.
That's awful.
World Visions staff from Donggala have arrived safely to the Palu centre, where they have sought shelter during the presentation at the farm site in front of their office, but they passed great damage on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of ruined houses," he said.
That's awful.
In the context of aid organisations, the duplicating preparations for crisis relief began, some complained that foreign auxiliary workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad may not be released into a crisis zone until it has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a person speaking for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Greece, this is a national disaster' we can open the limits of international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status."
That the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after the earthquake of Friday and tsunamis hope friends and family of those who are still missing that their loved ones should be among the miraculous stories that brighten up the dark news image after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was caught out of a hatch.
On Sunday a woman was rescued by rescue crews after spending two days trapped in ruins with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had thirty-two of the missing paragliders for the Asians, which was carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional need to carry," he said.
Gendon said that in hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey hook marks, or a couple of blue hook marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Driver Styles USD 26 750 under minibank refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and made ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's employees" and stole a money bag that was to be delivered.
Witnesses so many suspected escapes from the court, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes its name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) had called Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancels on "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio director Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with the West, has also varied between the use of binder strips and large letters.
Mexico AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's accession president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "never will ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fought a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements broke across Latin America.
Lopez Obador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal acts.
United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
After each China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they use in research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and performer of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with notices of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the field of innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next major performance in artificial intelligence coming from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that hit the U.S. best Othello player, and later he was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the American government's previous technological competitions, such as Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held, to help find next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government funding, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that those with a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation is funding people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in public vote on whether the name of the country should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a public vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has put a stop to including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the public vote, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the vote is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership in the approval of the agreement with Greece?’.
Those who support the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that arose after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live free under EU protection umbrellas, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a large number of Members have said they will respect the outcome of the vote.
The amendment requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has said that they did not receive any irregularity reports by 13 a.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made a small scene and drew up chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a high head, not to be let in the back," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they won't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
State Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to a vulnerable investment in Macedonia, which has a employment allowance rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev says after voting.
He says that a "yes" response will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a questionnaire issued last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of eligible participation in the referendum will be lower than the required meeting.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle to the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero maneuvers over the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously light as he scored a target in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a match at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran about a fight with three Brighton defenders before he came out on the open path.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to hit Brighton's Keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the network.
"Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems," the city manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
"We talked about he came to play 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League campaign.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful passage through the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling against the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net right before it was over the dead line.
City plays against Hoppenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoilers for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and there is no reason to sit down strongly.
However, the equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playability of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one battle in the NL West.
Rockies got a wild card space with a 5–2 win over the National Friday night, but is still out to secure its first division title.
Although we have nothing to gain, we can at least play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to become the highest level of battle I get to play on this year.
Why would I not participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced its launch pitcher for Sunday, but must certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and would throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-wing Washington player won 18 matches this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia
The President referred discreetly to the situation around the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the vote by the Republicans in the mid-elections.
"All we have done is in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued «You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power back at any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to move to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as their objective the "resistance and prevention".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sin and evil and pure and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and referred to democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the audience was loud.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you played the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to sensitize me, it was barely a surprise.
I am, after all, the last in a long number of Labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be sensitized because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to the importance of having responsible economic policies, as regards national security, as regards Europe – ironically enough similar things that the Jeremys were in disagreement with former leaders.
At the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour Representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise that 'more flexible, more friendly' policies will be too much forgotten if it all started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when I previously thought that I shared many political positions with a sudden beginning to expect me to take a U-swing and stand up to opinions that I had never previously agreed on, either the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and I have nothing to say – I receive a lot of bad messages from social media that require me to be dismissed, condemn central politics and tell me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I am well aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that gender-discriminate and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to worry.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross disparity has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the election rules is getting smaller.
I have received much advice over the last two years, where I am invited to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “do everything better”.
But that was not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which had led to my classroom in the public school I went on to be literally finished, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative's proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that, because the country is tearing our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and powers on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of abandonment or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best to safeguard their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbelieved Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tennent's Premiership campaign.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unscrupulous of the ten.
Finally, it was as much their controversial defence as their ability to use the opportunities they had given to the home team to get rid of the sailor, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far and we are still out of line, so I must be pleased with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "All honor to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the management, but a yellow map to Scottlandskaptein Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, lot Melrose uneven position, and Jason Baggot performed an effort without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a criminal park before he, just before the break, scored and the target park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started the second half hard, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruarihid Knott, which was dragged out on the bar, and from the beginning Ayr's leadership increased even more a trial by Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the path to the full with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to cover the Climo when he had no ball, MacPherson held a touchdown at the entry behind the triggering Ayr mill.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flange Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the site.
Still the Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with a gift permit.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes manuals and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of the Afro-Morn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a rainbow deck in La Paz.
Public building lifts a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire country of Bolivia still has a fresh memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country lengthens after once again could sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, awaiting a knowledge from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has a driving force, a Community spirit and a sense of humor, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its knowledge in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after several decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatically native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on Monday's knowledge.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will soon take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The United Nations body, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to leave Chilean territories and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The International Court of Justice's knowledge comes only six months after the last arguments were heard that the case was “not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's thing, the last four years can actually have done things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has cleared away any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came in a hurry.
According to him, Monday would give Bolivia ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘stop 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties’.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political shield.
«Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
«Knowledge is a reason to see what we have to do to overcome the past.»
North Korea says nuclear destruction will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never undermine its nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the pledges made at a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to launch the fixed nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘desirable dream’ that continued sanctions and American resistance to the war will sometimes force North Korea into knees.
The US authorities are skeptical about accepting the statement without the first implementation of significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang really has plans to give up on an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fact sheets in Paris reveal the last within huge headgear, which is on its way to a clothing store near you
If you want some big addition to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne took out a selection of rare, over-dimensional headplugs as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels on the motel in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eyebrows down the catwalk.
Valentino's most observable plague was an exaggerated beige had painted with a spring-like wide brake as the heads of the drunk models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewelryed watermelons, a trolley hat or even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also took off a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had repeated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation remembers dive equipment, including snorkel and dive glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream in the kitchen.
And if you're out after even bigger fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Stylish experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The over-dimensional hats come right into the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the head of the beam with a half-metre brake that has been seen on all and every one, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach sink in a stream that is almost as big as the swimwear model carrying it.
The orange raffia dish, which is bordered with raffia frenzies and supplemented with a white skin handle, was the most eye-opening creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Moteuka in Paris.
Kendisstylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach towels in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such an impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland's free schools are still showing academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with some one year's excellent exam results. They are supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other community action.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Fresco Council), have more than 30 000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailor-made school pension, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after career in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands when his head says it.
If you speak with him in his own language, then his heart shall speak the words of his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only keep English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the year's exam, we see that the language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of attendance from fresh schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign language received thesis character A.
The data obtained from the 74 schools of the University Council showed that 72 per cent of students received the A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people who are more likely to need in the future.
Languages such as professional choice are now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the basis of fresh schools and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons of employers, 17 percent of the problem of job vacancies could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
Depending on how many and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language to speak a two-digit number of participants (15 percent).
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today's children.
More languages, in particular those linked to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, e.g. mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between in fresh school, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools have the aim of creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in the teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction for Scotland's youth.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday's opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he should play is still not determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-song plan.
"I don't need a leader at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time for Trump's public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a number of election meetings tonight, Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned public meetings during the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected supreme candidate has been put to the fore, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming mid-elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress when the voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the weekly hearings for the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to one week while the FBI is investigating the case.
The main objective of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump therefore said that during the next few weeks, these five people's meetings aim to "fill volunteers and support players, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for his agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible while we are moving towards a travel campaign season," Reuters was heard by a campaigner for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican latent, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift on the points of view," said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to maintain faith as they enter the Sunday single game
After three unilateral sessions on Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The rotating pendulum of the moment is a fully stated concept of sports, but nevertheless some players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They led with six points and now it's four, so we'll carry it with us as a little bit of a moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the road for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead with four points and it is 12 to play for.
But as Spieth says the Americans feel they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Speeth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams got higher after each as his round continued, and fell to a decisive ponting to lift the match to an undecided when he and Thomas were two behind two.
His putting, who won them the 15th match, was met with a similar cry – of the variety that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is hopeless.
"We really just have to put all the clubs together and focus on our own match," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Speeth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are most likely Ryder Cups' great success story.
Europe's extraordinary but glorious couples have four of them and do not make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy looks to move both to and from the living crowd make it clear that they are the greatest competitors of the Sunday, and there are no other players in the audience or will see a European victory that the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Anyway, both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a slow break with Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bowey and two doubles during the first nine holes the Spanish and Swedish were so far on demand that they did not have a cloudy chance to take back the advance.
But on Sunday, there's no help getting.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at because of the interaction between the couples, the councils they give each other, the councils they don't give and how a strategy can turn at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has lost some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after he has completed his fourball and foursomes match with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led on with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised its score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, fighting to keep the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get any further advance.
Jim Fury's side must get eight points from Sunday's 12 single game to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has got four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been called “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have got four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After having broken Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated smoothly to beat down Woods and the American smoker Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stood through two matches on Saturday, glammed into intimidating, but has now lost 19 of its 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, retired to the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is ranked as number one and three on a world-based basis.
But Europe did not get all that they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze south-west of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who won the biggest three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history has a team able to get in after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need to get Fury's side undecided to keep the trophies.
But having been for the last two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will "never" join unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust against the United States and that the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented "significant goodwill measures" during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembling the nuclear test area and by not spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear drought, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear destruction completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at all the first meeting between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the nuclear destruction of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls for the reduction of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
«USA insists on 'a nuclear suppression first' and lifts the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force and even by 'the declaration of the end of the war'', according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us in our knees is a dream of desire for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, or the United States, the nuclear destruction of Korea would not have been as determined as it is.”
The tone of Ris' speech, however, was very different from that of the four-year-old, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland with North Korea rockets was inevitable after Mr. Onde President Trump called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
Having threatened to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN and rocked Kim to be brave enough to take the steps of disarmament, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is depleted.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said, “It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced strongly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear suppression."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the North Korea accused him of having come with "walking demands".
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to drop a missile area and a nuclear weapon plant where the United States did ‘appropriate measures’.
He said Kim had said that these "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by taking on the growing occult by climbing through the night with caffeine drinks as a fuel.
An academic found that students at the best university in the world often had no clue how they should keep on themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after holding a lecture on the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
After the talk a young woman came to me and said, "Why has no one ever said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academically and sportingly, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a bedroom, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants may know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons allows participants to think about their own daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, in the same way you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and let modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Good sleep should be the ‘secret weapon’ of the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course. He took one of the classes of professors last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are rolled up at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm when they were going to be as well as when they were going to stand up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's Goal Turns Out Gerard's Men
Rangers led enough a removal when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerard's team 1–0 on Livingston.
Ibrox-side wanted to win its first win since February 4–1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and left since his eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Melting locks up to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers could never compensate.
Rangers are now falling in sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernia on target differences.
There may be more trouble in fermentation for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from a remote audience.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, as he passed Ayr and entered the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy about how his well - trained team struck the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with it while they had it.
They were only supposed to have scored two minutes in the match when Menga's first match sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long fresco of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if their game had lent itself more hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have had a criminal park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first round, but before Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with Lassana Coulibally's head and a stupid kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening in 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head called when he chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player switch gave immediate results when the gamer sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone managed to get the players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithuania and Halkett caught up with a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have pulled the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Litgow head from the corner.
Rangers exchange Glenn Middleton had quite a late demand for a criminal park, since he had the port in conflict with Jacobs, but then Thomson left.
Almanac: The Founder of the Geiger counter
And now a page from Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and has also become a part of popular culture through the movie "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.»
Evans: "Let's say it makes sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave his name, lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many forms of cancer and is injected again in the patient.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who learned the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovaries she suffered from disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typically too much cancer, and then reinjecting these cells in the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovaries cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, taken from the patient and "trained" to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was built in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a familial performance where he awarded US President Donald Trump and said he would put the election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, introduced a Make America Great Again hat, as long as he went out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, 'How can you be like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I was afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the charges of sexual assault presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, it was uploaded by West in social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to make the West ridiculous by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the public that he had heard it in the back room regarding the selection of headgear.
‘The mobbeth me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
The mobbeth me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?" he said, and he said that he would "take me on the Supermann hat, because then no one can say what I'm going to do.
Try to love.»
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL so flue out, Variety, who told a staff member, "The whole studio was dead."
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our bravest: Takk FOR YOU IMOT MASSENE».
But talkshowed Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "he is and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art" which I believe is growing and asking for ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name.
He's not the first artist to change names and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rappercollege Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, it is the dead musical Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Sight of slaughter after cutting at the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been shot after a man was cut off at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington lengths to "gift masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordhunter Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticised the stereotype of the macho hat and says such roles in movies often get young men to believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In talks with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, something has gone wrong and confused about how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones-College Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, agreed that he was very busy with the theme.
"I am quite worried about the time – where did it go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we created men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculinity roles.
He continued: "What is born of what is born of itself, and what is beloved of it?
What is broadcast on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to grow up just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young people.’
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any sequences or sequences of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and he says he is “completed with battlefields and horses”.
Since November Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a Ranger.
The shooter recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy prized fantasy.
The couple married the family of Leslie in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of inhabitants living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country, says the health representative.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfers.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men after each marriage with women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection in sex in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to cooperate with leaked data on Republican senators, exploits «dangerous lies» and «conspiration theories»
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied Saturday charges that members of her staff had issued the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawyers.
The Los Angeles Democrat's assurance of the claims was made by ultra-conservative commentators and websites.
"Little lies, lies and more disgusting lies," said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included the addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, released by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the charges of assault against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had expelled Kavanaugh.
Conservative web pages, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to the Waters office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
"This unwarranted charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie," the Waters continued.
‘The members of my staff, who have received their identities, personal information and security, compromised as a result of these regular and false charges, had absolutely no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unjustified charge is totally incorrect and a regular lie’.
Water's statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, among other things by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This sentence is aggressive," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They mustn't go to defense.
They must not question the accused's motives.
They must act in a calm and calm manner.’
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting aggressively during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the mid-elections, also air his thoughts on Twitter.
“Place – if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her opinion, Waters said that her office had warned "relevant authorities and the police about these false charges".
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,’ she continued, ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.’
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloody Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look at Brexit's events in all new films with a British moment and it seems to be up to date for this revival of the parishioner Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would sarcastic self-satisfaction about how clearly hopeless we are to become the nation's new exporter?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its blond eyes and rubber face have been given a renewed license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who despite his great-grandfather James Bond's ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a deacon Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the musical recording with a fire-thrower theme during the opening ceremony at OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the longer forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mysterymaker who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in Johnny English's last journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a middle-aged helicopter and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but humor feels quite bloodthirsty and strangely overwhelming, especially now that the "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Neus are willing to escape comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fads are not as inventive and eating as Mr. Bean's stummy eyes.
The current premium is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the reverence of the guardian agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a minister of state, a pumped and decomposed figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this similarly-Teresa-May role, but the handbook does not give her much to work with.
Her editorial advisers inform her that since every active spy has been discovered, she has to pick up some of the pensioners.
And that means the cloned Johnny English, who now teaches at a snobbed institution, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence, and there are some kind of sequences here when English offers a rock academy for spying.
English is tapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and re-confronted with his old, frightened helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, apart from a commandant, a hysterical overclassie, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotating everything at the command of the queen are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing woman fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Minister of State is being carried out by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British cyber problems: the coroner Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the trip with a pragmatic side jump: dressed as servants they put the guys on a charming French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta luxury yacht; and English triggers the clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to become known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it's so much that it remembers children-TV with all the stuff.
Pretty moderate, it's all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of anything but: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets his talent?
Work promises to prepare plans to let the British work on Thursdays, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British a four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The Party will see to it that business leaders will use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra week off.
This will result in employees getting a three-day holiday while they get the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to four-day check so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the 4th anniversary is an ambition that matches the party's desire to let the pendulum fluctuate for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party's overall industrial strategy’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day succes during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A Thursday is not the party's policy, and is not something that is assessed by the party."
Financial spokesperson for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘professors’ of public service providers.
The plans of the Sky Canal also mean that existing shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting the full share item back because a Labour government can make ‘deduct’ out of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company boards and set up an employee fund to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to the employees, which may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" about the FBI screening of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind.
The FBI review of the charges against judges Brett Kavanaugh has put forward a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's finding may give some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview that was sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about the FBI to discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, sure, sure."
However, Graham's voice seems to be stuck in stone.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be an eye-opening finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett beat it energetic," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to act and a similar impressive mission; eradicates the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people streaming to the great plenary in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions” such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to a world leader, take a phone call or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their poverty eradication target.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just a case of so-called "clitivism" - that people feel a great deal of help by signing a signature campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million shares from their adherents, with a range of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare their commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that the secure funding has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom that will "help children to exploit their full potential", and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate mishap in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undermining a footnote in history," Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 shares in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road – including we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-party movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the artists who will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman on the occasion of the year's event in New York.
The United States may use the marine as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Minister
Washington may ‘if necessary’ for the marine to prevent Russian energy when the markets, inter alia in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular when operating at the invitation of the legal government, is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern wing of Europe," he said.
And according to the person, there are always ways and means of handling this.
«USA through the Navy has the possibility to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that energy does not reach the market» he said.
Zincke spoke to participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiles itself as ‘the voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of communicating with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are much the same.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe; they want to replace Russia, the far cheapest alternative for European consumers.
Therefore, members of the Trump administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European Gas Management 2 which, according to Trump, made Berlin a ‘capture’ for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's brilliant resistance to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of regular competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” at his presidential candidacy for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” whether she would remain as a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
At a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would remain silent.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the chess government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I should be a presidential candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm completely worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his supreme candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI review before we vote."
However, an opinion published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own electors do not believe that it should be held in 2020.
58% of the ‘probably’ electors in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to an opinion from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The opinion showed higher support to former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidacy in 2020 are among the other vice-president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
By saying he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD at Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being attacked in seven.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families that experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said about the son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home the shepherd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their military cameras and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country”.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the aim of violence at the home of a woman, closing with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eight countries and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that rejects asylum for victims of return or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided guidance from a friend of the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against the federal police in August has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent son-in-law" abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum claim on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, such as nations that have comprehensive problems with reproduction and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigration Court of Appeal which gave undocumented immigrants the right to apply for asylum as a refugee from domestic violence.
State attorney Karl Racine in District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is missing from many decades with state, federal and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the guidance of amicnus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy of denied access to immigrants is damaging to the US economy and that it is highly likely that they will become more founders and "help with the necessary labour force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and return violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those leaving the home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political vision,’ the Sessions said in the Communication of 11 June on Policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the death figures are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very exciting," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at an evacuation centre in the most difficult city of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances that all come together.
It is a lack of interest.’.
It was possible to see residents who came to damaged homes and ease through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had a power of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the damage, among other Dwi Harris, who broke the back and the shoulder, is outside Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe post-mortem.
He gets tears in his eyes when he repeats how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth stage he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves safely.
I was clung to the wall that burst together, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘tracing’ with ‘propaganda advertisements’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper launched a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that condemned the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to withdraw to the Des Moines Register – the most-sellering newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a statement China rejects.
Trump's statement that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials according to Reuters.
It is quite normal for foreign authorities to use commercials to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in a escalating trade war that has led rounds with new tariff rates on each other's imports.
China’s early criminal duty in the trade war was to hit export holdings in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former multi-year governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader's installment in Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China's stairs now raise the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the avisicosioken on the street here in Beijing you don’t find many divergent opinions and can’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is below the threshold of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: ‘One of China’s biggest advertisements rejected the offer to publish’ his article, even though he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans withdraw female electors before the Kavanaugh fading, warns analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest right candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have been accused of sexual abuse against themselves, analysts warn that they will get a reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given evidence that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last few seconds would be enough to calm down the electorate.
"Women will not forget yesterday's events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors «Novmber is coming», while they demonstrated in the Senate times when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, that's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger ones between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they lie to the president."
Even before the Ford's public witness, which gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual abuse against the highest right candidate, analysts thought that it would be a reaction if the Republicans forced the appointment.
"This has become a blessed root for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the Committee’s vote or the final approval or the establishment of Kavanaugh – it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom they should believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witness explanations, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of the respondents were fully or quite convinced about Ford's testimony, while 35 % said they were fully or quite convinced about Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or entirely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under his testimony, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the Flake game, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh had committed a crime against her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest right candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at a festival during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new web to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agency, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users may choose where their data should be stored and the persons who have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the objective is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
«It is a historic moment».
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data storage online or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What's unique with the online personal data store is that it's up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal data authorisation’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company must provide with resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some initial developers to contract to work with the project and a repeat volunteer programmer.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to «Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which would make their business models completely changed over the night.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.
In an article on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "commitment is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next epoch of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Celebration of Victoriakurs recipients from the 1st World War
The only priest in the English church who was granted a Victorian Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant and priest Bernard Water was awarded the certificate of honor on 29 September 1918 at the battle in Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a snowman four days later and never knew that he was assigned the highest British military appointment.
A monument was discovered by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his childhood children, Michael Water, said it was a "pretty symbolic" in that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Water Battalion led its over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through much thick fog and under a strong protection from field cannons and masquerades”.
Later, he headed towards the firing line and led the line “with a big face” forward before he stormed a field cannon by himself and threw out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Watern, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that made me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Watern said he “was very pleased to play a role in the parade” and added: “The bravery of a real one is fully demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA adherers were up all night to watch the competition program Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa pig
Make sure you've been up all night to see the compacted Bellator 206, just to find out that you don't get to see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the eyes of the United Kingdom sat waving when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Someone was less impressed after keeping up until early morning to see the battle.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of search ghost".
‘It is a state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00, so they could be transferred to the children’s programmes,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
"Peppa grey, yes!".
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the views in the future in Great Britain.
"I think we can find out for the purpose of the campaign," said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe in it -- as we sat over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five fights – as we usually send – and we tried to extend ourselves far to the supporters, but the tip over.
It is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympicist Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24th year says it wasn't before in high school he realized that he was "not like others".
In the first Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homophils to give other "hop".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The usual programme leader of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be away for a few months due to disease.
Daley showed up as a bit off on Laverne's first shipment and said he felt "less worth" than everyone else he grew up with because "it wasn't socially acceptable to equal both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have the strength and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, and he used his participation in Australia's Australian co-workers to appeal for several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he's lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give other "hop".
The three times the world master said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married the Oscar-winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're going through so much in such a young age" - he took part in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me yesterday, everything turned out that I just had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in OL.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year after Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to step in front of a home audience under OL, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in the run before OL and which still gives him ghastly skin.
Desert Island Disks goes on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson took out the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup fight, but he has to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mikkelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12th time, was put on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk before the champion's fourball and foursome-combats.
Instead of being at the centre of the events, which he so often had been for the United States, the five times the major-winner divides the day between being heroes and working with his game at the range in hopes of correcting what's going on.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career and is not in perfect shape for the strict Le Golf National track, where the long rough area is still punishing wild blows.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, meets Mickelson, in the ninth battle on Sunday, the British Open-Master Francesco Molinari himself, who has fought with the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the fights their week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, the Mikkelson games can prove to be crucial.
Fury expresses his trust in his husband, not that he could say something else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Fury.
"He has great confidence.
He's a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these laws earlier, and this week.
I didn't see enough for me to play two matches.
I saw more for me, but that's how it ended, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 loses and seven undecided, but Fury said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, white and he likes to have fun with others. He's a nice guy to have in the closet," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was funny to see.
He gives more than just the game."
European legislator Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European legislator, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entry of the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 campaign at Valderrama, where one side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the carriage to itself the sailor with a minimum possible margin, 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still remember that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we used to, but only so," said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have got the points on the table.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
The bear is very pleased with how his players have made their way on the steep golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual performances are at the center, and there's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances that play golf are tested for the full.
It's the message that you have to tell the players that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Fury will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners.
Fury himself has been on both sides of the great revolutions last day, and he was on the victory team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe carried out the 'miracle at Medina'.
I remember every condemned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the commander of the law in 1999, had ruled with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but one would like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medina.
When the moment starts to go in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle struggles.
We arrange our configuration then and send the people out in the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the summit, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the order of players.
"I put this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
German Marines' latest cargo would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the cold war, but it will not happen before the very next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the pilot ship of the completely new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who quoted a military figure.
The ship would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the marine back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It has been agreed that they shall be equipped with a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest freight for up to two years away from the home port.
Continual delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were told to give Germany strength on the sea – will already be delayed before they are put in service, Die Zeit reports.
The shipyard F125 created headlines last year, as the German Marine officially refused to put the ship in service and returned it to the shelter Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media referred to a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has an enormous weight, which reduces the performance and limits the marine capacity to make future upgrades.
The 7000-ton-thousand "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price gap on the whole project – including training of the human race – has also begun to be a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion, from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new fergates are of particular importance in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually "empty for usable ships".
The officer said that the problem has been escalating over time because old ships were displaced, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the frogs in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust clothing on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out by a country property in the Scottish Highland shall determine how flag mouse uses the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flag and flagged mouse as well as brown-legged and water-flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flag mouse activity through the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The expert's sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and the species that do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural protection advisor, hopes the results will discover which areas of the habitat are most important for the flag mouse and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pasture grounds and the best way to ensure the conservation of the forest of flagfish and other associated species.
The flag mouse population in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction that affects young people's places and the demarcation of habitats.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as domestic tax attacks.
Flaggermus is not blind, actually.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than for the eyes when it comes to catching change.
They use advanced ecolocation to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mouse very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out studies, maps of young people and including rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only flag mouse reserve at Thrave Land Property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag mouse species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a perfect area for flaggermus," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about flagger mice, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to endure."
He stresses how important it is to map the flags before maintenance is carried out on an property since the unguarded destruction of a single young space can kill up to 400 dogs and young people, and perhaps explore an entire local population.
Flaggermus is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their youth sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish staff for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while lawyers will investigate German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against himself as “false news” and says that people “want to be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375 000 in advance of keeping close to the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33 years old Ronaldo rejected the charges as «false news».
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times the Goldball wins in the camera.
«They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel because of the claims they have called ‘an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for ‘revelation damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of the privacy protection in recent years’.
The alleged event was to take place in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the footballer's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was ‘99% a good person’ which was betrayed by the ‘one percent’.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that images of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they found a case outside the court because she was "free for revenge" and was also concerned about "to remain publicly suspended".
The 34th year, she says, she's now trying to make the difference because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged breach, and moved this summer to Italian Youth on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will ensure for eternity' the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will provide forever’ if they lose the status of the world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'disquieting' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of late border crossing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're going to close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers say there are supply chains at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of ‘prescription as required’ and comes every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, as the industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day stocking at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit's future EU-connection plan is "precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that makes us not only able to enjoy success at the moment, but also taking this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, after each, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back."
One government speaker said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be exposed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's decision-making meeting with the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "exposed one more week" while the struggle around the highest bidder Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump and Russia, as well as possible obstacles to the exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will be rejected by the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threatens the independence of Mueller, has for many months been the norm during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th basic law supplement.
Rosenstein threatened the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather let go of Rosenstein, but then the meeting was held to prevent it from colliating with the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday Trump ordered an FBI review of charges against Kavanaugh for one week, which further put forward a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not fixed; it could be this week, but I understood it could be a week's suspension because of everything that happens with the highest right.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will argue that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Softwared Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to opposition to the "self-sufficiency" of TV, although she added: "I do not agree that they are self-godly".
Then she pointed out that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
‘The President raises more questions than any previous president,’ she said, adding without giving evidence: ‘We have seen the figures’
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will be absolutely better than talking to me.
We are trying to get it often, and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks, and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open submissions or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible reason, when he made a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a number of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland concerning Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (public health) to express the country's gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for a residence and employment permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the release have taken place in the summer and are expected to take place on a solution to the harvest.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to repeat how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide, and outside, colleagues provide valuable experience and expertise as strengthening and improving the work of health services to the best of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home, and we hope you will be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after having received a head injury during the payer's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the side line and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated by the Vandercar Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘there is no information on the type/range of the damage yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the damage occurs.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five picks on Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives in total 18 picks for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase an property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corby's plan to attract young voters
The increase in document fees will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Finance Department expect it to increase to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's plan to attract young voters with the promise to offer more reasonable housing and a framework for higher income groups.
The increase in document fees will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the government's measures to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The profit - which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on residential number two and rental purchases - may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built property in London is purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which drives prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spam villages” due to the many foreign buyers who are mostly staying outside the country.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson came up with a proposal for a reduction in the document fee to help several young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May be denied allowances on reasonable housing to solve Britain's 'degradable housing policy'.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a wide range of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified returns.
He also wants to give municipalities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: "I said yesterday that I would spend my time as a minister of state to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as non-resident companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working British citizens.
Too many people have the dream of owning their own home too far, and the worthless situation of the homeless.’
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old bulkhead is pleased with the challenge of reliving the club in the north-east, which currently holds a third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeed in the clubblade.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he wasn't eager to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in the Premier League."
According to the structure and facilities of this club, they are probably the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself to be successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in the heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to return from depression to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of depression to win the pounds next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real difference of course," he recalled when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds nice since I did it well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it with regard to stress and pressure in the job, but management feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It feels like the most comfortable I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing study
The heat wave of summer has strengthened the revenues of the UK hard pressed pubs, but let me press more on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2,7 % in July – while the revenues for restaurants fell 4,8 %, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at CGA, who reviewed the figures, said: “Continued sunscreen and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a similar pattern as in the previous month of June, when the pubs increased by 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1,8 % in the restaurant phrase in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had a far better result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-as that restaurant went down.
Food-serving pubs also had difficulty with the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for the rascal drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, the increased turnover of 6,6 % that month, with food-serving went down by 3 %.»
Paul Newman, analysts from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the main factors in the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to be difficult, and a turnover of 4,8 % year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a longer breathing room."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in the roll-outs of new trademarks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media they hide for their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years of age – have secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, showing research
A study of 20,000 young students discovered pages with «fake Insta».
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘main account’ that they show their parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years of age – creates social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 20,000 young students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the screenshot pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concerns of sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violate me".
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors' Conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the ‘voice of freedom defenders’ in Scottish Athletics board
Elihid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freelance coach, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the race to gain insight into her extensive experience on an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-renowned area of freedom, and we are sure that free-law practitioners in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am excited to act as a voice for free-law practitioners, and I hope I have much to contribute to the guidance of the sport in Scotland".
The American won 200 and 400 meters under OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold, and she's now a solid BBC expert, and after she got a transient ischemic attack, she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today, I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show whether I would be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm pretty good again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing soft exercise!
Thank you for all encouraging messages."
Breast pump ad comparing mothers with cousins divides their views on the web
A breast pump company has split its opinion on the web with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world's first soundless breast pump that is being carried close to the body’, the Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and floating, musical video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a leaf full of high and curry to a song with, among other things, the following text: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't understand it, this is not a jury, it's my buds."
The core goes on, "Fow it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my balls."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the “greynesses” in the dairy industry.
«Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," it was one who wrote.
Elvie breast pump is well placed in a amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Probably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd like to have one if I still am.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little dirty, but I took it for it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one that wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a funny ad directed at mothers as pumps (often at the workplace or toilets) and feels like a cow.’
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the b's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely stationary, has no wires or snakes and has a nice place in a amme-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to light up the search for breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we show the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week a baby mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tentyard at the Texas border in all secrets
The number of migrant children detained has remained stable even though the monthly cross-border crossing has been relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most support players themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of being in the country by stepping up and making demands on a child.
The risk increased in June as federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to present fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of persons seeking to be supporters of single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had not previously had a criminal record.
‘Approximately 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
Officials are trying to manage children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of meeting personally to conduct their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to recipients and reports from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are relieved are translated because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the counter leader without getting enough time to prepare emotionally or with friends can strengthen the traumas that many already suffer.
Syria requests the United States, French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil in the wake of the fight against terrorism and ‘will be dealt with afterwards’.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terror is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said that Damascus will continue to "lead this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-lording country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘certain Western countries’ of ‘stirring irrational refugees’ that make the refugees stay away.
"We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to arrange for these returns," he said.
They are policing what is really a purely humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement abolished a large-scale attack on Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who “will be eliminated”.
The UN mission, Staffan de Mistura, hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to establish a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem submitted the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘transition of the articles of the present basic law’ and warnings against interference.
Why Trump will win a period of time
After that logic, Trump would have won a reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, the rule of law and scandals will end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever".
At the moment, there's no sign of viewership.
Since 2014, the best transmission time viewers have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC «The Rachel Maddow Show» has peaked the cables with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, programmer of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's a entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions that take place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and health to the global economy.
Disengagement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened man when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dipping in the background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with struttfjere verd 15,000 dollars (“a plague struck with hybrids”, said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
"Some of what he does to make it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's varied role crew and day-to-day spin on the plot (kangle with NFL, Shamrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he stayed in and looked at the MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we put all the broken programs in old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the fairest intermediates of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania 17 districts experience a flow of money after a conversion of a congress district that ended with two seated representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-occupied urban district in Pittsburgh puts with democratic representative Connor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplemental election last year.
Lamb stands against another seated representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which greatly overlaps the new 17 district.
The map was retraced after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were a fundamentally illegal manipulation of the electoral circles in the favour of the Republicans.
The choice in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on campaign financing between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a closely followed supplemental choice for Pennsylvania 18. District to the Congress in March of last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
USA Violated criminal measures against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to the Trump Organization.
Officials in the Foreign Department decided to withdraw the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “new decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the criminal measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, including financial assistance cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and death.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference at the top level that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year, which was assessed as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid-September, however, officials in the Supreme Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which put an end to all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now encouraged to speak to the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding to the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or criminal action from Washington.
A speaker at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From the History
The next speaker in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal enforcement, which is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is also in the process of expanding the review of whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in the integration of our elections.
If the congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of preparations to meet the electorate again and perhaps at the end of a jury of his fellows.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's case is inevitable – and not for his contradictions in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years with the bloodbath that followed.
The pace of history revolves around such milestones, and the inexhaustible march of democracy accelerates or inhibits.
The Americans are facing several of these fanpoints now.
What will we do if Trump kicks the justice minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a hard time ever since this newspaper reported that he proposed a secret hearing of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
"How will we react if the recently implemented FBI screening of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is granted the highest right despite credible attacks and unfair evidence?
And above all, will we vote during the mid-election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not consist of these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me out to light up on the table with the hacker.
With such an inheritance, how can I be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimism before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty of winning over the Austrians after the impressive undecided struggle in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in Europe.
A broken barrier midway player Graham Dorrans in making his first performance for the season in undecided combat 2-2 against Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and got a point with us.
Maybe we could have knocked in at the end, but it was definitely a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and was the best team.
On Thursday, it will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last battle, but with a home audience in my back I'm sure we can stand and get a positive result.
The spring was absolutely tired, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team's good and the boy's picking up; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can stand now, put the last season behind us and get it on."
Women lose their nightlife due to the fear of retirement
Although participants in the study had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the children about it.
‘People want to be taken over by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that call,’ said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Activities.
That's what you're gonna do.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the counsellor and the family where and how to care. Such choices may have a major role in determining the costs.
Take your economic advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Remove legal problems at the same time.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that your health work will comply with your wishes if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make economic decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in a list so that you can prepare them.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

A man was shot several times with a firearm when he was on his way home after a miscarriage.
The victim, a man in the '40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "unmotive action".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have demanded witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the figures of death are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is situated in the vicinity of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrates 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongåla is a regency extending over 300 km with a coastline in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economics of the Central Province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Assistance Administration.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is situated on the Seismic Spring of the Pacific and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A earthquake with a force of 7,6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A green earthquake hit the Regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the reigns of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coincident buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake is the focus of Indonesia's tourism Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and led to the temporary destruction of thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, harassment with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have received the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged breach.
Palin is being jailed in Mat-Su prison and detained for an unsecured debt debt worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself ‘not guilty, absolutely’ when he was asked how he had asked the question of guilt, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three abuses of Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and charged with a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a class B delay, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time that there's been a look at Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is handled by Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, silence with the report on domestic violence and to hold a weapon while he was guilty of the incident.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: more than a hundred casualties
At least 384 people are killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7,5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just like the central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dimmed over the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist rapist in New York who killed eight people – a rare penalty that has not been practised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he took down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘suddenly’ and caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intention to seek a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury of 22-point sentences, including eight sentences for killing in the face of money laundering, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a sentence for violence and the withdrawal of vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and planning", said the actor, who described how Saipov carried it out as "holy, cruel and ravaged".
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time Southern District of New York led a death penalty.
Indicted, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the researchers that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the observation.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He was not guilty after the 22nd sentence.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were “evidently disappointed” over the decision of the contracting authority.
"We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the authorities not to seek a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the armies of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians would get the " feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he be held responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom ‘ville had been evicted’ now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to send its deep split lines, has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State is fighting to keep the Brexit plan on track against the attacks of Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the withdrawal – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "Caos".
Bone told "Denomination means denouncing" the demonstrations in Solihul that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and had the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When explaining his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone defied claims that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: "The statement that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is totally wrong".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyn also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and in our activists, who are actually the ones who cross the streets and get us elected for the first time.
Discard the Brexit Plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: “Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises”.
Farage said that the politicians would be "suffer the pressure" if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken by the public vote in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the armies of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest before we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
During the marched Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis honored the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free friction limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers himself to be a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "regarding being a presidential candidate seriously" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a council meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.

She has been central to the speculations if she is going to face the Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who had used the council's format since Trump became president.

Warren replied that it is time that "women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman on top."
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton looks at the world master's title after he's given the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Botta's qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stock orders would play a big role in the course.
From Pole Bottas got a good start and fed almost Hamilton of the track while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and decided Hamilton to continue running in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels which made the Ferrari's reluctant fate inside to be free after a double passage to defend himself in a third turn.
Max Verstampen started from the back row of the field and came in as point seven at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led in large parts of the course while he lay on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overcome the Kimi Raikkonen who lay as No. 4.
He ended up in the 44th round warehouse, but failed to increase the rate in the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good top," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump awarded Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not play the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest right candidate Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's witness in front of the Senate's judicial committee. He commented instead that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "unsightful, clumsy and abusive".
"The only thing that could happen and the pleasant thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are sad and bad and kneel and talk nonsense," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done it».»
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you played?
Do you remember her answer... you played the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not played».»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't play," he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to let it come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked for."
But her refusal was not welcomed by the president, who, during the party event on Saturday evening, commented: "I shall tell you one thing, it was a pretty bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the highest right candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president stated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power by all means necessary.
You see the madness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to move to get the power and control," said the president, Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League losing against Belfast Giants by winning the return campaign 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received a two-way tour through shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were offset for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before two targets of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the sailor.
It was the third Elite League lost for the season for Adam Keef's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the laws, and Giants had won the three previous fights.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford released the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned home in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt posted to the Crown's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first round.
The house regrouped and Bouchard was once again offset by a professional goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen to give Dundee leadership for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the sailor with the team's women halfway out in the end.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that several hundred air passengers escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as completely after he died and ensured that a plane that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily weakening control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely shine.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Talsperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We cleared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rates may rise to several thousand, and the disaster preparedness body of the country reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
‘The figures are expected to rise further since many equal are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,’ said the body spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have raced Palu, which will keep a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time, you see ambulances that come to life.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being raided everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross is working febrilely to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks involved in evacuation.
Are you clear?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man has been missing after flight crash in the camp
The airline that owned the plane as crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, and they previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while they tried to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some testify that the plane was bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to swim through the deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots had panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry people to land before the plane fell about 30 metres below the surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have crashed with PNG-registered aeroplanes in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The contracting authorities concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi living in 2014.
USA Analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phones to push the movements together to 29 years of age Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, that night she died.
Rowlett said he collected location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, something that fought against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone for Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was speaking the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was "crazy because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they only knew each other in one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chamber's death, deleted Tellis' call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence shall, as planned, begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passengers Indict Couple for Termination after "racist" Message
A child-career in New York investigates a couple for discriminatory rejection after having received a wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was “one black person”.
The couple rejects that they are racist and compares the application to "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a stepmother, expressed disappointment when she found that the new baby passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
«NOEEEEEILY A SVART PERSON», Plasco-Faxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, there was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who said up Maurice, claiming that their stated child-passer, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one of the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month losi-based arrangement she was promised, however without contract.
“I would show them that – hey, that’s not what you’re doing,” she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on the charges that they are racist and say the rejection of Maurice was the only right thing, since they didn't feel they could trust her after having insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the application with ‘expressing’ was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to finish and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly fine», added the stock exchanger.
While the legal case goes on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behaviour and attitudes.
The Paddington publication feared that readers would not accept a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put up with others when they read it for the first time before it was issued.
It is very funny to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
She says the father, who had been working as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the baby book of a small wedding ring, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned off.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father in secret was very proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was no funny person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who makes a joke: you're proud of it even though it's not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to honor Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
On landing, the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were given the job to save her life.
"Ned called regularly to say that it was so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so glad of you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The doctor had given her to make the heart beat, lost its effect slowly and left the system.
She died a while ago, and the organs in her body fell together.
I just had to sit there and wait, for sure that it happened.
I couldn't celebrate and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who now cared for the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know if the tests she had passed.
"No one knew," she says.
"I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but there was this overwhelming feeling for Nad on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with mourning women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a postcard on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers can call to get help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45 years old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a soothing smile.
"Everyone knew him in the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He ended up at work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time that it's going to be an infectious effect."
Sharon added the cards “to tell people that there are people out there they can go and talk to, even if there is only a friend.
Don't sit down for yourself - you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On 1st Christmas he was in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas, they did not get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to fight through it: "It breaks up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand out and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts looking
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scale-limited survey – we might come to a certain agreement,” said Flake on Saturday, and let him fear that the committee would “fall apart” along fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support players want the FBI to examine?
The motive was due to the timing.
The average elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are likely to do so badly, it will be much harder for them to have the man they want chosen for the highest right in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and operated lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley where she was personally secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that vice-president Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him placed in the highest order.
Number of North Korean evaporators falling under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sought, which refers to data from the South Korea Collection Department, said it had been 1127 discounts last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human mice were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of North Korean runners are then offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the refugees through China, which have the longest border to North Korea, are easier to cross than the strictly monitored demilitarized zone between the two Korean countries.
China views the riots as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in war, has improved considerably over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the agreed negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they in large movements agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for missing progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will sit down unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to sit in the highest order
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the highest-right.
Pelosi came with the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosio about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh threatened the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, including almost crying and crying when he talked about the family and the years ahead.
He was also strongly condemning the democratics of the committee and calling the claims against him a "grotic and coordinated character killing" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the highest court since it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualificating himself with such opinions and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi felt when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the highest right, but also in the right that he is sitting in now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair grief, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're thirsty," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so nice, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to," you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm crazy."
And then she just kept going.
And what I thought was great."
Tears are allowed as the end of grief partly because they become fundamental misunderstandings.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I began to cry with inexplicable rarity and was caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss whom I had always been a little scared of – who dragged me into a trapper room.
"Let them never see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're lying to you and be happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he served as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to be unfaithful to the husband on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of sitting as a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it was close to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore that she would not stop if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wondered.
When she kept the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as thoughts about sexism – that she fell together in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about how the press told her.
"You should think that Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking I thought they'd write on my grave support?
'She crys?'
How the US-China Trade Wars Can Win Beijing
The opening-up of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and although the fight is far from over, a gap between the countries may be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by placing customs on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new rates of customs on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has, of course, returned every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent charge on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match US attack for attack, and the world's next largest economy probably won't lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to provide for demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shorts correctly, the pressure on the US trade war can provide a positive account for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic shocks in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before," said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria “clear” for return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which is razed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress of combating terrorism," he says.
