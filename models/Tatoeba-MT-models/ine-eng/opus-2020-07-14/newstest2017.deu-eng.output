28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the house of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm him, "At last it went up with him again."
The Leichnam found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had spent six months in his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our affections are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank lived in hostels first, but that, "the things went up for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His kind of connection with his family was always to cook us something to prepare us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything going on in the world, he was this unscrupulous diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD signal phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be stuck in shoulder blades
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this unmistakably clear in an interview.
"I'll always be stuck in drawers or get stuck out of the outside label, which usually has little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful."
"Excuse me, these things are more convenient to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The best thing the actress spends is her time at home, in front of a TV set with a lacquer and a Mexican meal, it's called in the magazine.
To the white light, she raises the question of the wish for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are remarkable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, sought a slightly different approach with an exit to the beach.
For the 58 years it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses reminded themselves of their holiday evening, they were hunting in the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs.
One kilometer at this time, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.
He was led by his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even venture to take pictures.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was absolutely convincing.
The German sport aid provided the male from an house in a small gala to the gold sports pyramid.
There's no lack of a nice sportsman for awards.
Bundesverdienstreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has named him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it will not only be for sports success, but also for social engagement".
For decades Langer has been promoting growth.
And so he gave the price of 25,000 euros at the same time.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the double U.S. champion was taken to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fetter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahre Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemölle and the posthum by the handballer Erhard Marvellich.
Many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize was held.
Bernhard Langer stayed away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.
However, at the same time, both US presidential candidates are involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can harm them - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
On the other hand, he would have been completely different, said Trump.
He will withdraw regulations massively, and he will make himself a major tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and companies.
Clinton says, however, that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has unfavourable opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
The needs are invested, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the State-critical Teaparty refugees of the Republicans.
So we could have some more party discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal plants and re-high coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, which he wants to announce under the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to develop the renewable energies explicitly through its investment programme and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in infrastructure but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, both the US do not want to isolate themselves from international trade - but just to protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be paid, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months should rather develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to dissipate the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously in the room with large eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she notices that she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the München North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrovs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has been officially opened for a long time.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as hope takers," she says.
For women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many steal away from it secretly because they do not see another way out."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, rape, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's on the run.
"This trapper, for example, asks for a bottle of water for sexual action, is no rareness," Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that this is the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Here too, self-employed women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and misused at least.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the München north are traumatized, they estimate.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often did not know how to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their area of responsibility is answered by some with no.
There is, for example, no such thing in the governments' premises in the upper and upper courts.
Even in Schwaben, refugee women are not kept separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press speaker.
In Oberbayern, sub- and mid-France, there are in some community-based buildings or own houses only for women and their children.
The exception is Lowerbayern, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separate from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If the privacy is lost or men and women are kept together, it can happen - continuous - violence against women."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, as stated in the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be seen at the Andrang, which is available at the house in Munich.
"Since it has been said that there are us, we have a long waiting list," said Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Barriers to assistance: calls for new measures to combat unemployment
Representatives of the assistants have called on their trade unions to approve new anti-fraud measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members released on Thursday evening on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "absolutely calm" about problems which led to the rejection of the treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to reject the proposed new Treaty completely and to request official renegotiation to all your concerns."
As a response to the government's failure to do so, the JDC Board today has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating action, starting in early September.
The disputes led to the fact that assistants this year spent six times, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA assisted Dr. Johann Malavana returned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be favourable and accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of External Sides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed sloppy and he barely radiated heat, even for his lagging conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeated by his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
On the next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as being so upset that it would never happen.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to point out the opposite.
But one of Putin's powerful, sustainable cools showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the departure of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was burned.
Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia falling in the back.
The pass was even bigger, as it was passed by an alleged friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild the widow if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media launched a strong, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the charges of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which were controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's been fighting this a lot.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message said that it was time to look ahead.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first of all, all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office in a broken state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also scared him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are reoccupied.
They count on a late-sea anthropogenic storm at the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the west because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In this regard, the continuing role of the EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is intended to benefit from the cold mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the west, is reflected in the ongoing roll.
In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a prize for his request for support for the elected state body after the attempted state strike.
This is well-known for Moscow as a self-understanding that even has a profound fear of change in regimes.
The summit meeting at this bright sea palace enabled Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described it, to represent "the alliance of external sides": two countries that are broken and badly treated from the west and are now united.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peace foundation, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be noted that after almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even written the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about her differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when the NATO member Turkey launched the Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced to a back office role, according to the Bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the Bank has distanced itself from almost eight years ago when it had to be collaborated and saved.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have used to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be given more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a brand's bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global targets, but local targets.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customer under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the credibility of the various brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th award at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profits
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British profits at New Market on Friday.
He placed on predication, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a mile stone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes on the joy when he holds the victory on predication
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 wins in a record break career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine Derbysiers 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He has been a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismonunt
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismonunts, Frankie Dettori has been the hangman of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorical Sevens" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month spiral, but he showed an impressive character strength to confront his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not yet at the end - Dettori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions until at least his 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fire Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly left his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest trust circuit for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that Putin has arranged "the discharge of Ivanov from his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration" without any reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been a representative of Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website it is (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do you believe the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow's secrets.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest to Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would return to his own wishes.
But in spite of the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them that are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once accused of being a potential president - wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - stood on big skeps.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to trust me with these very complicated posts - one could almost say - complaining posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his representative.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term Putin's would have violated the Constitution.
But these items were taken from another closely related Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat the producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical conflict at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his release.
In the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series followed by an FBI team of agents will be published, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, at a later date.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with him since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've stuck my whole heart in the last twelve years," Gibson said in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but it will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the 12th staff is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in Garten in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be about the 75 fish on the sandals that were released from a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might throw something light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry Crossing with the road - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "deckblaze", which closes to the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wires.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown made a visit today and was one of the first to go from country to country.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the road and the bridge deck is a great activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth receives a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented construction of height and depth.
After the installation of the last section of the road end and its connection to the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gaps on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.
Massive, because the road is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weigh and had to be pulled up by a rise of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances that the team was working on were minor - they were only a few millimeters on each side.
Luckily, I love everything very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Good luck to be alive"
Three men have "good luck in life", after being thrown off their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat in its vicinity turned around and presented the worst of us," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond their reach until we leave it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was excavated at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without rescue.
They all came on board the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had a emergency stop, but it got rid of the person who controlled the boat while the boat was in the middle of the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - Man insists on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to his apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut off the clothing of their ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stepped on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's dress, he called his mother.
This one alarmed his sister.
Together with her life-threatening, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down their brother.
But she could not move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her life-threatening.
On the street they met the former life-threatening man.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds good apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean that investors will be given a much stronger commitment in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes a "business concept of residence" for the next Council meeting.
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is the question: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A scheme is still missing.
SPD President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big point in the hall was, so Bratmann said, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but at least 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing programme, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left wants still hard work for investors.
Despite this, so Bratmann, there is an increase in the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration.
More personnel will be needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the experts.
However, the program is still not complete: because the around 1260 new apartments should be built without delay.
How, though, does the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will take place in the coming years, compare?
By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it has to be thought of bringing apartments back to the price bond.
It's possible in the West City.
On one occasion, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, the deadlines run for the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be returned to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners do not want.
Because the number of social apartments in the West city is increasing dramatically again, one is removed from the objective of the so-called redistribution.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a Hunt for Health and Happiness That Rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens has been blamed by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, people are going to get out of the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly limited on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (there was a series of drawings, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat early in July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and look for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and, as soon as they are found, can be "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "taken".
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the whale and ran for the search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that put the "average" person back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people who follow 30 minutes each day has risen from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to bring to it "take 30 minutes," "from the sofa to come" and "to be active every day" stood on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look sad.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of getting sick of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.
Thus, three columns of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also Murrian players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports how this game does.
The new one will lose its rice and the use will be left with time.
However, because of the success of Pokemons, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active value in the real world and help many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dammenten
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the spring horse.
Don't worry about the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
On the whole line, brilliant.
And now, finally, also the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American tournament crashed on Thursday to the multi-combat title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympics.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver Medal winner and final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
American women Simone Biles is turning on the swimming pool during the women's solo competition finals in the art tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fighting title and totals the fifth, while she holds her calling to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
In the last three years, Billes has mastered her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of pride and precision that the 1984 Olympic player Mary Lou Retton of her said she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Billes and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be viewed as a disappointment.
The Americans, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, are in arms after winning each gold and silver in the single-marriage finals of women in the arts tournament at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a sign of exorbitant at the celibacy celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Billes was on it, during her long journey to the top, never having planned the future, that is not really true.
Part of its ground exercises - which contain its typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, in which Boorman was trained, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-racial competition, a series of victories that will be held as long as Billes wants.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture weighed down.
Swim bars and floor towers - in which Billes holds the world's title.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the pool again - and set up another one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman was as gentle as she expected her final appearance - a pure formality - and tears streamed to Billes brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a rocket for the last four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went into a tiebrake at Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, named by the Americans "Oma", had a lead.
After her exercise, she threw her hands to the public, overcome by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Billes is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killers in the car when listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade while they were sitting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The shooter fired eight shots from a hand firearm, while he stood on the side of the car and then ran with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the three-time murder did not seem to have resulted in a robbery, as the attacker did not include the handbags or $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the killer to become a closer look at whether she was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in Spanish residences within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential place in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Linear, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder, and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Detectors found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalie: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves the singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought, I didn't make it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for that.
What's not right at all -- of course you've been able to do that," she said.
Your husband Vincent and you were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was, 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year of life and he can still not speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bicycles.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund intended for "Please sing to me"."
"We bring him a sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microzephalie has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as masts or zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding causes rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the Governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated throughout Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in Southeast Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with massive flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, shared that the demands for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoea had required tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisianas until Saturday.
The Weather Service indicated that additional 3 to 5 duties could fall on rain in this area.
In southern Alabama, a early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the mobile area.
The river committee near Baton Rouge and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekend record level.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could swim many houses in the vicinity near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a river-side flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as they will flow slowly through the affected rivers only in Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams were still sinking people from the river water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepfather were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, has increased significantly over the night.
He said he would have been warned by another step son who lives nearby.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the obstacles and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Notthelper had saved all three in a large military LKW and had brought them to the next fire department in Gloster, where they were kept until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "extended fast" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer was notified near Livingstone from midnight until Friday morning of 13,75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been very complete since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were arranged to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the town of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed because of the high water and provided sandbags for the inhabitants to take, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were to be reported on Thursday as overfishing, but were not reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "caught by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child will be shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gun injuries, including in the land, leg, arm and belly, but that he was conscious in his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was covered with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in stable condition.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police found out whether they could be among the injured men of the perpetrators.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a crossfire between several shields.
Patterns of storm defences that were traced back to various storm defences passed over the tator.
It seems that this has clearly been a constant struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were caves.
This seems to have been the case here with several armed fighters who were very actively involved," police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the Police in Philadelphia told the envoy.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm when she played in front of her house in the vicinity of the West Oak Lane.
She relaxes and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympia team in the tower and that for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I've been at every summer lympiade, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have been inspired by many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one of women was an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and American.
Now the world was able to be witnesses of the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did not expect, but delivered masterly gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the tops of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like tournaments all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all entered the same path as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Also, it is last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a expensive sport and tournaments primarily come up in private tournaments that are maintained by parents for the training, installation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families).
Most of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tournament.
We must enable the communities, even a number of young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide more affordable and more accessible tournament training.
I've founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide the young high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team to bring the thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanking her for encouraging so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants would like to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected it.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to enforce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are intended to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week work in order to improve the maintenance of unpleasant hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assisted Doctors last night, said in a statement: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is heating up the current staff crisis and that it will be avoided to treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have been made by the government to participate in protests and sometimes on deaf ears.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the excitement and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to take further action.
The last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide doctors with coverage on the strike post chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, asked the assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said, "Employment measures do not reach only the few, but load overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only worry, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee on Health Care, and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries have responded positively to concerns about pre-mortem and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional background, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - would be a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in keeping with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day medication that can reduce cardiac pharmacology
Thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after the authorities have recommended that this more people be given for a longer period of time.
The inhibitory medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart disease for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter suffer from another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries, forming the walls.
If the attack breaks out, it can cause a blood vessel that closes the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the blood vessel dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and close the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack must be at a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it more unlikely to form blood vessels.
The guide draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of a person.
Experience has shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart disease and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidelines do not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year to launch a government report due to corruption from the office
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is significantly ignored, as a devastating government report has revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally urges the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "obligations regarding ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now a king of corruption, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that it should be allowed for the police to set up bans outside of electoral camps to protect the accused voters.
He recommends that voters take a statement with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a elector must name only his name and address.
The report proposes that non-refoulement of non-refoulement ink be applied to a person's finger if they give their vote in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community submissions and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This serves not only against election fraud, but also against the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is involved," he said.
The report was organized by the Downing Street as a result of the Hamlet Vohlskandal Tower in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics into silence with racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman "is to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a succession in which one person chooses than another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed himself particularly alarming at the fraudulent briefing - the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, represented, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the conduct of demonstrations to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence that pressure on members of certain ethnic minorities was exercised, in particular women and young people, in order to choose, according to the will of the elderly, in particular, communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on briefings to stop "whalers".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before selecting your statement.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic briefing.
It prohibits political activists from editing complete letter boxes and envelopes of letter boxes.
The police give the authority to set up suspensions for election stations.
An amendment to the law which facilitates a charge of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (General Law 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters go alone into the election room.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising", that after the Hamlets Tower case no fine was presented.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as impenetrable," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal law - for reasons.
It also criticises the ineffective "abhak control" of the election registration departments of the councilhouses.
Sir Eric said, "The court order in Tower Hamlets has been a warning signal since last year.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and the lie of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy by Kates Radler-Doppelgender and other famous doppelgenders by Olympicsportlers in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio this week were made over the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-prevot except for Rand and Band, who proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duke of Cambridge.
But this summer, 24-year-old Olympics is not the only one fighting for gold, who shows his own famous double-walker - at least not if you can give social media faith.
In honor of the Olympic games in Rio and all the famous faces flying on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain similarity to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and wolf: team member of the US team in the left-wing Brady Ellison, since his childhood, will be compared to Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double-walker on the bike, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bowhead of the twinning of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.
The team member of the U.S. Army in the bow shot, Brady Ellison, caused an explosion on Twitter after showing the images he saw in secret similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the sense of madness in the social media and said that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I see no great similarity myself, with the exception of face-to-face," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll make it up to you as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since 2012 will undoubtedly become even more focused this year: the striking similarity between the British Weitspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass through as a double-passer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who showed similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-shaped skin and blonde hair like the actor Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to compare a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also found the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of actor Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tower Gabby Douglas, who presents her own beautiful, wide smiles, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m free-swim staff empirical viewer of the CBC Live Transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was missing" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-swimming staff.
MacDonald, who was taken on board to the CBS Commentary Team to give more "color", could be heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, it went away like mief, died like a pig.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how did a pig die?"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, when many put him on the table
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC transmission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized to the people who responded to the comment on Twitter over 90 times.
Commentary colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night for sending us and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to it as a person.
However, they were unmatched and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to expose her as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the women's swimsuit in the CBC Olympiament," he said.
"I've been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no misunderstanding was intended, and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark empathises with women who try in the middle of the business with shameless underwear
The buyers didn't know where they should look when a woman pulled their clothes in the middle of a price to try undercoats.
To make the situation worse, she had to look like her, pull her out and put her back in the regal.
She continued to push and tried four pair of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underchairs before she put them back in the store
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she drew back and left the shop without buying anything."
She said: "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underwear from the exhibition, pulled out her own socks and socks and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, because she put it back in the bag."
She repeated the same with three other underwear before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, pulled up again and went out.
"They didn't seem to disturb that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would, under circumstances, buy the underhandeds that she had approved."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How can we resist thinking that someone would take undercarriage with someone who had another person and who had not been washed?"
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to get the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman had caught her and pulled her out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said, "Prmark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch office in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga From Weapons Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a great master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbery at close distance.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the air around for your predator.
When approaching you from the back, you should turn around as the first, so you can see your attacker and "get yourself out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.
Then beat him with the knee into the rope and turn while the attacker bends before pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run to the face and move back while they fix the weapon on him.
In attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the gun and turn it around so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, place the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back and put the weapon on it.
Sounds hard?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi makes it.
But think of it as the safest thing for a robbery to deliver your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright loses his tongue for a guide to the dirtyest places in Europe
A British traveler undercut his immune system and herpesflex of a serious test - by covering some of Europe's most filthy and noblest places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, lost his train on a Euro-Sheen, a land on the Piccadilly Circus, a wash button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before skating each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will focus on.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the light of day.
The idea of removing the spray button from a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally depressing, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darbacterials and his own health.
Luckily, he left nothing that he had hidden, more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries to railway stations to toilets, the task was definitely tested by its immune system.
In the film, he said, "Just as a child, I was relatively concerned about my health, and I've put all the possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and shale water."
In the film, he was named after him at all times.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample stretch showed a number of luminometers of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to separate after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna put anything in here because it's fucking in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company is taking place with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darbacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Slots and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried through crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in oral health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in oral health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had looked at some of the things I had told him to look like the noble Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to bring Ian to draw her and others, where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty lecheries to film."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all diabetes bacteria surveyed in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent reported that they use at least occasionally products containing the added diabetes bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A family left their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £500,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the apartment society found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wood fragments were blown up, dust was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the household administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would not be repaired anymore.
She said, "It was an absolute dream for people here and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is informed and her name is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment at the same time and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and running.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be destroyed under circumstances, old mills were found
It was in the past that drugs were removed from the stocks of wood
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
Delogation was enjoyed by easier neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times that we say to the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have confused the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the weekly side of the municipal house, dust and old toys were thrown down.
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to assume any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horribly taken into account.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community have done and have let us get the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours courage and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that will be left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the ground
Workers of the household administration will now have to remove Müllberge that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police conducted a Razzia in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as wagons, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a drug of Class B for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without cover, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms in the house were damaged with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delogate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall's police told us that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house rules.
"This is about those who think they can handle themselves without self-defense and those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal set off in panic after a deep-flighted military beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft launched an incredible crash
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft almost flew close to the sun worshippers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose when they obviously started to worry about the noise of the dunes, without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It was twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked as if it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep
Today, the Portuguese Air Force reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and flying so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that Jet, due to the poor visual conditions, caused by nearby surface fires somewhat deeper than usual flights, the air forces insisted that safety was not threatened at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force reported that the pilot had to fly so deep that due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke - that his vision had to be limited.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat had to identify as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry about Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish Supercup outside against the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must refuse to compete with the underlying Cup finalists and the ruling European League champion Neymar, who fights with Brazil the Olympic football tournament.
Goalia Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German suffers from a knee-breeding, which explains the question of Barca at least for the first time in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen laws in Barcelona have been on status one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far abandoned a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but for this, Ter Steps in most of the remaining applications are ahead.
Before the first mandatory game of the new game time, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. were not yet really convinced at 3:2 in the attempt against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has the 2:3 lower position after the extension of the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far eleven success of record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic player.
The 27-year-old won his countryman and "titler" Zhang Jake 4:0 (12,5,4,4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the world rankings first achieved the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to Japan's Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the final game, and the title was intertwined.
Thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the five rows.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had returned to the Tribune and left their shields in the fair fight alone.
"The matches I've been playing for my country so far."
"In the finals I play for me," Zhang said in effect.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners with the Chinese fans.
The match itself was unexpected.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the tempo on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points from there.
Because of Ma’s superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, there was no disappointment in seeing a sufficiently stunning change in the ball.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-end, the Russian had suffered a ripple injury against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was treated in medical treatment, had to "lastly" deal with Blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have also become a similar high table tennis Olympics.
Donald Trump solves ′′ violent problems in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is ordered by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states, to exploit their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now contributed to the weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-evident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals into his own Republican camp from the race, the doubt of his success in fighting the White House grew.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Because of his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media records.
Waking Republican Hochburgen
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions see Trump in front, however, not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the Federal State.
Arizona and Georgia are also in danger.
In an interview with the CNBC broadcaster Trump answered the question of how he would like to stop Clinton's front march again: "Just as I have done so far."
And I went back: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation."
He doesn't do anything but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that is all right, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign, so it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress want to get stronger among the poor.
Olympia: Treister fraud at Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After an attempted fraud in a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was involved in the immediate establishment of a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village of Ferguson Rotich, had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner.
This was reported by the Doping Controls team leader Kenya.
The world association IAAF asked the IOC for information on the case in order to pursue its own investigations, an IAAF speaker shared with him.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, who passed the tests and signed them," Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He had the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing WM fourth.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Lite athletic delegation chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed sportsmen of his country's upcoming doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was to be arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC following numerous doping operations for a long time.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusual to suggest that special athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the vision.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping control is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The light athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
In a number of TV reports of the ARD, suggestions were repeatedly raised that Kenya’s doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in the Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport, it was covered and systematically baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonardo Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth dream.
In the orchestra digging the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he sighs.
We always say that she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with Wehmut her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would still be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She likes me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She's an unforgivable, generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dummel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion, and a happy way of life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the inhabitants of New York didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London's schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that she experienced her family a few weeks ago from her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's ballworks in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-based country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is there - as an opinion and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - people will refrain from ever taking this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a election victory at Garland.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton yet whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were lakeys and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found Donald Trump to be inappropriate for the president's office.
Treats wants a calendar for "Women and Men"
The trade magazine works with photographer David Bellemer to produce a 1970's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The chief editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his Nacktmagazine of Old School Playboys was different, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently he thinks it does the calendar too.
"We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nuisance, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting aufuffref in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculated with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed bags," says the Chairman of the Yellow-Behind Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany counts briefly with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", says the president of the Alliance Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh conduct of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, following the coup, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the Alliance Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.
Because the government had already crossed Kurdish castles with fines months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the broken pusch, even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks are added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees themselves produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitian cities.
In order to increase Erdogan's output pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been cut off or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of Association demanded that the Federal Government "as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany too, a "Hexenjagd" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Yellow Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Opposition.
The branding as a yellow trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, also the Chemicals and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Yellow-Near Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As reported by the press on numbers of the Federal Ministry, the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany, which has been recognized as a result of political persecution.
On Wednesday 30 June, this was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all as asylum-seekers (39.625).
In this survey, there are no survivors of war, poverty, or insecurity.
Asylum-righted under the basic law are only politically, i.e. on the State side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it boils"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Black Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more blood than so far is not going on: summer holidays, heat and country day elections - that's what it's all about.
The locals who are to be convinced by the voters are on holiday.
Most holidayers who are in the country, on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not native, so they must not choose the day of the country.
Practical problems arise: In the holidays there are helpers to hang the posters, blow up air balloons, spread flyers and tell the end of voices to drive only hard.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let election battles just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it's also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in investigations.
It is exciting how strong newing afD is cut and what remains the rest of the coalition day.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 chief of government, makes a nearly ineffective election struggle, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and spreads a little with the people, just as it has already done his legendary master of the predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the flowering of the AFD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create this" has accelerated the rise of the lawmakers, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right choice at the wrong time.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to major events; Merkel Bundestagskohlkriis is located in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalias, Berliners and Saxony there than Mecklenburgers and pre-pommern.
"That was probably the majority of other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it hurt no one from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel once.
On the other hand, the Northeast-CDU largely ignores the usual electoral stand on markets and in front of shopping centres with sunscreens and air balloons.
This, as Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that on the ground, it has to work hard to find a wire to people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: in the countryside you hardly exist.
However, the council of the CDU-Walker Kokert to his teammates is also self-evident: "They must go where it hurts, that is where the people are: Villages, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election struggle.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last placed with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only shortly before the AFD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD was still clear with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should create the spring in the country day.
They make from the holiday need a modern virtue and put their struggles largely on the Internet.
"On-line election," it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters are looking for trails for local citizens among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just riding a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lake and finds it even nice.
Her impression: "Wahluk in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-Sanitation: Hospitals suffer from obstruction
At the speed with which B 27 is healed, there is nothing to melt.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is half a lobby.
"They've done everything pretty crazy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet Tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was able to be planned to move to the south until the end of October.
It is also promised to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of assistance services.
Since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße has also been lifted in Offerdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the site.
The citizens can now go back to the side of the B 27 from offings.
It seems to be going down the road.
"There were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Officer Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the repair.
The inhabitants of Bachstzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because they were looking for many bad ways and were more familiar with their navi than the description.
What led to some Lkw being frozen in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community called for a strengthening of the vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant exceedances," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three liters per minute.
The fastest was on the way with 77 hours in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has been quieter.
For business people at B 27, it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Business people can't look in the cards.
But that the B 27-sanization has led to revenue interruptions with them, let anyone who is asked to do so be transparent.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Who has less to do with the "end customers" so produced for other companies, for which the recovery has little effect.
Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running knowledge is missing".
The most strongly affected are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses have "has hit it."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
It refers to "over 50 per cent".
The road management has "refused for two years".
Half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the guesthouse would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the restoration.
Gühner knows from other lands where something more generous has been handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guesthouse will continue to exist.
Finally, since 1715, the family business has been located here, it refers to the long history.
The other family guests are now less often overlooked because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't walk out, it's nice somewhere else.
The return of his family client to the end of the repair work has no doubt.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Gohner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction works on his knowledge of the biggest crisis that has experienced his hosts in his long history.
Six months of construction, this is already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being laid down.
After the latest attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a state of silence have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the condolences.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in his presentation of his new security package.
They don't force anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
That's what I'm involved in.
However, as the Minister of the Interior, he was placed in results and in a "targetable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has allowed some time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, pointed out: the fact that a new security authority should take care of the crackling of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on aviation data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to impose fines on terrorist groups and to cut off German passports with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man says.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be acceptable and also asks for nothing that the coalition partner has no chance whatsoever.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have part of it: it plans rapid procedures for removals and more possibilities for arresting people before removal.
Refugees who are brought to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tortures for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to obscure their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally sensitive.
Some also seem to be inconvenient and allow questions to be opened.
And at some points - for example, when treating patients in an unequal manner - the question is, What does it actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said in Abrede that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that the people were deeply occupied were not allowed to panic even in the election times.
Internal security is enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the vicinity: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in favour of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
Only a long-standing dispute about the provisions of the Federal Police, then a political assembly of security ideas of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the chief of resorts also demand a Burka ban and a waiver from the dual state citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for similar sounds.
He didn't keep anything from turning out of the double pass.
We have released the debate in Germany.
Don't make any sense.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is on all corners of the constitution and whether it is actually "appropriate" for the coalition partner, it must only be shown.
There's a few in there that could provide for the fight.
But the SPD is also trying to profile internal security on the subject.
Participator Sigmar Gabriel only signals a cautious conversation and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security".
There's still a lot of cars going through.
Despite Diesels Candals, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But it doesn't run in all markets.
In the retro-reflection, there is vertebral around a term.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of carriers in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can still have a plus over the course of the past year despite its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the VW’s core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again charged the total sales, as reported by the company mentioned in Dax.
The brand VW sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market Germany, the deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
The weaker figures from July, especially on two sales days, led to less in Europe, by brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a reduction in purchases due to "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, a speaker explained the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU.
In the United States, where the gas business first escalated, there is also another minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony continues to be glossy through the diesel canal: after the first seven months, only one delivery minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
From January to July, the Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to present another sales plus.
1.3 percent of more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, the world's 5,904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be refurbished in the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, the VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After the replacement of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the refurbishment, the autobuilder issues a "guarantee-equal" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was said on Friday in company circuits.
The reason is legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This has been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport in the past Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has the task of fully fulfilling the tasks of my Committee of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
The VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration shall occur in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the replacement and that all vehicle type-approval values are unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop for example half a year after the refurbishment - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it was also important to avoid any other damage that had nothing to do with the exhaust canal to ensure that there could be security arrangements, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros in giro or day money accounts".
The German Banken Federal Association speaks of an individual case and sees no sign of it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty".
If banks are to save money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay 0.4 percent of their penalty.
This fee is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros to giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He's been spending 40 million euros on a day that could be lifted from one day to the other and that he couldn't take.
"These are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend any million 4000 euros."
He will now continue to pay the costs in accordance with the prosecuting principle.
The cash just to be left in the depositories of the Raifeisbank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth!" said the Banking Board.
Most customers understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few went to other banks.
The Bayern Association of Societies stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs to all banks".
It is not possible to carry it on its own if it is "permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With a penalty of EUR 3 million for deposits, Thuringia's National and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made its skating lines in 2014.
Michael Kimmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate payments for deposits to be paid, and the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings".
A banker said there is "a client who is more equipped with the power."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free of charge.
The Gessenschaftsbank Gmund founded in 1911 has two branches in Bad Wiese, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bayern Association of Societies "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate an exposure allowance for deposits of private customers," said the speaker Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negatively against the private customer is very, very high".
Competition was hard, and it threatened the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be allowed to do so in the widest possible way.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound plates?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before starting to comment on the part to pass it on under the pseudonym NotAllUnique MenMiddlers Ages with harsh insults, this statement is based on current data.
According to YouGov, the promising re-establishment of sound plates is not a tree in millennials that wants to welcome the newness of physical objects, but a result of midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
There is also no horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and wildly wear before I stand, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly adheres to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which there were once independent sellers - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialties.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and courage by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (date number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (date number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably about 20), is a long day due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These billboards, shown above (he sent me the snapshot via email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a large number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and once again bought items he sold when he was young and struggling.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are rather introverted and like to spend their time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my cargo.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet on the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media scene, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old plates again.
From the talks I have conducted, people have usually left their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phoenix to find out that record business offers a peaceful community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were affected by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted soundboard holes, from things that call for happy youth training.
"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like this with me as a collector, and I think it's like this with many people.
It's an easy way to deal with yourself spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member runs out of a record stack.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought a record in the last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% owns a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I am lighter with a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (date number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "Trophéenène aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone came in here just recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead dial so I can put it in the regal," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-laughing, less music-laughing.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people who just come in slowly.
Fop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the soundboard, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and women middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drains from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity with the customers.
None of them look lonely, but nurturing mental traumas are hard to determine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's rather making a show-in-the-ball as a big deal.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a lover of soap.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was making the appearance to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenagers grouping themselves for a moment about Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter pretended to buy a crossley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall filled with plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they're just decorative, some as far up as it's impossible to grasp it.
It's pure platinum art.
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depth of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a group of people, who have more time and money than others, is also the one who spends most of it on luxury items like plates.
Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are in agreement, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, is disregarded.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the booming through the plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through the plates, while they girls the dazzling view of an unsecret, 30-year-old false moderator who doesn't look at the shoulders of the ignorant men of middle age.
The greenlandhai is the longest living vertebrae - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland hai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates the Haie, says that the record was in a female, from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years of age and five meters long
French Court rejects offer on abbreviation of business in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be competent, that 72 temporary shops should be closed, in which persons within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they would represent a parallel economy from which taxes would not be paid and that there would be a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups told the Court that businesses and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of persons who were engaged in 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely legislative."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offered peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in good time and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to be the kid's café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the conclusion would be "for these children of a disaster, of which the last eight years are."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in Dschungeläg has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in Newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympics, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I continue to keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight again," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have a statement for his miserable twelveth place at the sugar hut.
"I find it very difficult to comment yesterday," Martin said.
He had to discuss in peace what reasons he had led to the debacle.
In October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed in the past."
"This is also my position," wrote the three-time World Cup winner who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54,5 km on Olympic Fabian Cancelellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missing semifinals
Laura Siegemund's victory draw ended in Rio's quarter finale: The world rankings-32 from Metzingen missed a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, which was charged with back problems, was able to carry through their attack only once and was powerless in comparison with the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump to the pre-closure round.
The Australian open winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas 2000 had won a medal (Silber) in Sydney.
Two German DTB-starters at the fourth final of summer games had been given in 1992.
A German duo was never in an Olympic single half-final.
Group rises at startup for live video streams
Other people to watch playing video games is a giant trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
As much money goes to take over, Microsoft didn't share it on Thursday.
Beam went on its offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but you can even tap.
For example, they can give missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
The gambling activation Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already in the process.
The employees of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle, in the US-US state of Washington, are turning to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam-Mit Founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi told.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
Beam, according to Microsoft, is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is one of the Google Mother's Alphabets.
Here comes the strengthening trailer
Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which will be particularly effective in delivering weather criminals.
For example, the futuristic strengthening trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway construction sites or to repair bridges with temporary Tempolimit to ensure that the speed limit is respected by a stationary flasher.
A permanent mobile construction, however, can be too dangerous or dangerous.
The Strengthen Trailer is autark: Its battery keeps track of uninterrupted measuring operations for five days, the crash data will be transmitted over a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously over multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans according to time, driving lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk condition, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily curled, it is reduced in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the parked and in the rest of the way even more suppled outer covers.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic data in various federal countries and is currently being used.
Foreign authorities are also bluffing with the new technology: France has ordered 100 pieces, after ordering 150 pieces last year.
Britain holds silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji holds Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby ended on Thursday evening at a sudden stop at the last stage in the shape of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line run and rough force to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was crushed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - UK fourth on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji Chief Coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind it.
Eight years ago they lost every game under Ryan at Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they lost.
This sleep becomes painful, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let go of GB's attacks from the spass.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in a driving bus. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With another four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A great tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leon Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua took a touchdown on the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resume and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravévou fasted through further weak taps of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Fijian loop...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant mid-play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favour of the southern islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame placed the i-tubfelchen with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff dissipated, the Fijians were embittered, and GB looked devastatingly beat in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had won Japan in the mid-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a short semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and reached a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later touch of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thereby the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to defeat
There won't be any more emotional gold than these games and that's what it means.
From the first round to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who went into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if there were only the two who were sitting on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of Coach Robin Williams, was all-knowing when they called on the second Olympic gold in the twin without a tax woman in succession, the first women in the history of British sports who put such a standard.
Her domination was absolute, however, her 39th unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who shine over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the kind of triumph at all.
Behind every gold in the mine, a battalion stands on volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive that day than cancer was diagnosed with him.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and that's what they did.
If you don't, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the interruption meant to a minimum, if in such circumstances the correct concept was at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The noise is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the instant of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an application in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a huge thanks goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not sustain.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want a fire work today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, as we did.
The couple will take a period of time for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV fan Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic player.
It was all so new to me, and I was so upset.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 Years of Verbal Care for Clearness
The manager of the Water Association "Vetensteingruppe", Ruppert Goller, goes to rest.
The association is considered to be "bayernwide" .
A small French drinking water supply association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was in the original tone a while ago in a contribution to the Bavarian radio.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Under-France valued the Association of Purposes.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered "bayernwide as provocative".
After all, Rupert Goller, who was 31 years of age in the association of employees, was 28 years of age as manager.
Now he was adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veittensteingruppe with its seat in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and wells with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Goller was set up as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed manager of the association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, and they ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budget planning, fees calculation and contributions up to the weekends," the president said.
As an outstanding event, she called for the establishment and accession of the new sources (1994), land purchases in the area of the new sources (1998) and compensation for farmers, the restoration of the high reservoirs (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stopping, and innovations have been repeated, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Goller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water association and he lived the water association regularly, as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district sub-France.
For this he has received a great deal of recognition and praise.
Rupert Goller, on the other hand, praised Alfon Griebel's Water Guard, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard and he was a faithful guy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tube fracture at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it will have to work all night so that the localities can be provided with water.
The provision of Neubrunn has also been possible only once because you filled the high-level container of Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who entered the succession of Rupert Goller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko opens up with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is left for two years when I sing at the Milanese Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from netrebko's connection to the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bartheide - Man shoots at life danger
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man himself called and told us to have shot his life-threatening," said one police spokesman.
The killer is on the run, he'll be picked up in public.
In the meantime, it's all over the country, because Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscleless, brown-burned and has a glazing.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a tie.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was born in 1988, the father of 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any mention of the tathering or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims; however, they confirmed that a man was killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We don't say anymore at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to the eyes, a special application command (SEK) was on the roof.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-based and energy-intensive German steel industry remains at an additional cost to millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the ecosystem industry are from the table.
It remains in the process of releasing the renewable energy supply for the so-called own-power plant in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Journal" (WAZ, release).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of close negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers to put the gas from the oven to produce electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year, according to the German Industry Association.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only if the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEC deposit of 20 per cent will fall.
But these too will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own-power generation.
This will largely determine the status quo of the previous regime.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign 'Stahl is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"At the same time, climate and employment objectives are to be weighed in the reform of the emissions trading system," said IG Metal-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world's largest producer country of China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers reject price dumping from Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
To show the effect of suspended import duties on steel, the economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.
In the last few days, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
At last, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, about 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel producers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Union of Steel reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantities produced now returned to each other in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by two percent.
In the coming months, the Association will be counting on an improved order situation with an increase in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing makes seniors good
The song has accompanied Ursel Kipp her all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studio she was wearing the field music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a trial, she feels more balanced, happy and all alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because Singing is also a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with peers, says Hackler.
Regular association allows seniors to contact and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often emerge at an age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Singing can be exciting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors are training a deep and controlled breath.
He who regularly asks for his lungs does not get so quickly out of the shower every day.
Even if it's about getting the sound of voice in the old age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher place value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, demenseral people themselves are divided into long-lasting events.
In Singing, the head is also required for special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A popular audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows through the singing in the choir.
Show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
Good reason to start singing is enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes down?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone sings from the famous circle in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer reviews of the audience in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or to the church leaders.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help in Internet research.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does good to the soul and has something to spare - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats on the steps of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats to adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen also did not let the men cold - however, they behaved in contrast to the women at all times.
Female cats can recognize the recovery rate of cats at the millions of babies.
They react by ten percent faster to the sound of cats, who are in great need, as scientists have come out from the veterinary college and the medical college Hanover (MHH).
Kater also reacts to the calls of cats - however, always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the millions of minor and highly trained young people for men are either unattainable or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the length and height of the kitchen cracks differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats from the maintenance of the MHH were observed.
They were designed to be called little ones who were taken out of the dumpster for three minutes and separated from their mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of stronger prepared casks, which were also raised.
The researchers consider their results to be powerful despite the low sample.
"All women, even those who had not yet their own upbringing, responded differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned more quickly to the speaker when this call of the highly edited casks played.
This ability may be born or developed with the gender line.
"It was a surprise that the men had responded at all," said the biologists.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the former Hakan Sükür football star.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the Putsch experiment, an important football game again takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is stated.
As soon as the derogation was suspended after the attempt to change in July, the government considered that the day-to-day situation of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is responsible for the attempt.
It is also not held in front of the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the State Prosecutor issued a warrant.
In the meantime, sugar in America is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür will be the followers of preacher Fethullah Gulen, who will be made responsible by the president of Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the first 90 days of the suspension still apply until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democratic wakes" in public places throughout the country, Erdogan explained for the end of Wednesday.
Sport is – like the whole country – split into supporters and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the workers' club do not traditionally count on the friends of the president.
What is happening to the great crowd of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In Pokalsiger "Gala" it will come back to Lukas Podolski in particular.
In the last season, Cologne demonstrated its sporting value: With 17 towers and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as topscorer of his association.
In the final match against Fenerbace, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a comparative conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lows" also appeared early in Europe League.
In the Super Light it was only six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the title 14.
This is also the reason that fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
At this point, only Gomez, who was under contract and seconded to Besiktas, had announced after the attempt to return to the country because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman quoted the magazine.
But the storms had to be prepared to refuse to pay around a third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear, "We cannot pay its worth at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanova must not start in Rio.
Other transferred minor offenders can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme of Doping is still determined as before the battle lines at the Olympics in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julia Jefimowa, who, after a Doping-Sperre, had just called on her right to start the game, was enchanted and exhausted at her start (100 meters of breast).
There was a scenic scene: with a smile set up, she was still proud of the hall and provoked by her appearance.
When it was found that they wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a cheerstorm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite Doping's past, go to the beginning of the Olympics in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-stuff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already closed twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its bond, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champions have been running even faster than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-stuff/Jamaica): The double Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to take a six-month delay in 2010 after receiving the pain medication oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended himself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, the 2013 World Championship, and the 2010-2016 European Championship, was tested positively on the forbidden methylhexamine stimulants.
Perkovic fights the important intake and has been stopped for six months.
This year the four widest dumps go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-stuff/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A resource for penis enlargement was responsible, appreciated Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Well hardly an athlete was so many medals later known.
Tichon lost his WM title of 2005, nine years later, after he was diagnosed with Testosterone-Doping.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia silver in 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 due to the abuse of testosterone.
He also received the unknown bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
At 80.04 m it is located on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km) to go, China: The World Recorder and Goldfavoritin was tested positively only in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the age of 29, references to the intake of a prohibited food supplement were found, the spree of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell slowly and expired on 13 July.
Bombenterror in Thailand - injured Austria - Several deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, said on Friday morning.
You have suffered from cutouts and have been treated in the hospital, but you have already been able to leave this.
Her home trip was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is not clear at all.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in constant contact with the local authorities, so quickly.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday evening in a quarter of a year.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two sparrows again went up and another man was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
At the detonation near the beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani, on the south coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a urban employee.
According to the authorities in a flower area before the coastal police raid, the explosion rate has gone into the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast required several injuries.
It was called from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The Bomb Nights wear the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to speak of possible motives - but it is probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attackers are not related to the Islamic rebel movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local Saturdays that restrict themselves to limited areas and provinces," said one speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were put in place.
In the past days, the authorities had received classified information on the alleged attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police directed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are increasingly smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not directed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over years by King Bhumibol Aduliadej.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed on its homepage.
High safety risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
According to disagreements between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel will be made to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the militaryjunta.
This is also a major influence for the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to stifle chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
After a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, the military, who had seized power, is in favour of bringing the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, it has not been able to get the military to receive the revolt of Muslim rebels that have been in the grip of the country's extreme south for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest blow of the recent history of the country.
The right "identitary movement" has become the vis-à-vis the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the constitutionalists in the fed have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'identity movement' points of reference for efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," said author Hans-Georg Maaßen of the Deutsche Presse-Agenture in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are extremistly defined.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "identity movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is turning against "Multicultural Way", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of your own identity through overcoming".
Constitutionalists in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitaries".
Maasten said his authority had agreed closely with the country officials in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identity movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it is," said the head of the constitutional guard.
In general, extremists try to address them with younger language, often with poppy music.
That's what Islamists do, as well as law extremists.
This is not significant advertising for your own business.
The propaganda is to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Last time there were reports from several federal countries about contacts of "identitaries" with AFD politicians.
Maesen said he didn't have any knowledge.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It should be noted whether the party concerned - in this case, the AFD - by certain persons who are extremists changes their direction and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore striking whether such persons have a taxing influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee refugees, he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freelance Group.
It may be that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks on asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European control of legal terrorism is not detectable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Concernedly, measures were expressed that a lot of violations went to the account of people who were not previously in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have therefore committed crimes that had nothing to do with legal extremists, which may have been politically independent or, for example, had chosen CDU, SPD or left, but which were then radicalized by a right-extremist spirit."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the battle lines in the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros had in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a virtual internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends up with a 48-second delay and placed 59th place of 59 beginners.
But it was rather his not just a sports figure that drew attention to the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special starting right by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimmers known in sub-represented countries.
Since most athletes were running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros had finished for the big race.
The first peaks quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English Boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's career was media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial-Guinea was unforgettable when he had to arrive alone in a distance of more than 100 meters of freestyle.
French was introduced to Moussambani at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
If there is nothing to be done with the choice of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He'll just go on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively equal to him: "At last it will either hit, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the U.S. television broadcaster CNBC.
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's all right, Trump said.
He referred to US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State's Terrorism (IS).
As a result, the opposition was increasingly widespread within his party.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric auxiliary vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is clearly great.
The post plans to sell your streetScooter electric vehicle as well.
In short, the group wants to start trading with the carrier.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into selling to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has been examining whether to sell their own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are to be delivered, also to other companies.
Post representative Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always requests, for example by handicrafts.
According to information provided by the news magazine "The Mirror", the Bonner Group will soon join the mass production of vehicles.
The company plans to build up up to 10,000 cars a year and a layer in its own factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleets of electric cars and in the long run to complete the transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK's leadership goes according to disappointing business numbers
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research firm GfK pointed out that the chair of Managing Director Matthias Hartmann will become more uncertain as long as the success promised by him remains.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After a further disappointing number of business and the decline in corporate governance, the number five of the industry is at the forefront of a new personal start.
GfK-Chief wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already taking effect on 12 September from the Supervisory Board.
As of 1 September, the management of the board took over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company informed him.
He will officially take over the function of a "presidency speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" to the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a business speaker on Friday.
If the market research company is to be led in the future, it is still unclear.
On Friday, the shareholders were disappointed at the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK point since 2011.
"But the fruits of restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will be at some point restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, it would also be the Quadts," he said.
In the second quarter of 2016, the company had not been able to stop its loss travel after a return in the previous quarter.
With 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable previous quarter.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales dropped by 3.4 per cent by 721.2 million euros.
The profits in the second quarter have mainly weighed the company's low value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company securities of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector protected the group under the strike a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK still had a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus spreads in Krummhörn in graves: Eight injured
On Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich County), eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 seniors.
Two of them suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid a lousy cargo that was part of the road.
The bus came to the right of the street and ran into a grave, as a spokesman of police officer Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the bus situation, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The firefight frees the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a notary car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the charges per cubic metre of wastewater amount to EUR 2.10 for Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkall, as well as EUR 3.36 for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,6 for Ashendorf and EUR 3.64 for Aszendorf (EUR 2.18 for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an over-calculation, the waste water price in Asendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, under the approval of the budget, the Land Council of Kulbach found that there were undercovers for these sewage plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the facilities at a cost-effective level.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as businesses from Welschekal, Neudorf, Reuth, Aszendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the money box.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-the-counter coverages from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The gravity of the charges was based on Schmidt’s fact that all three sewage plants are relatively small plants with a very low rainfall attack, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
For example, on the basis of the low distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a significant impact.
In addition, the discharge of water in all three installations is slightly delayed.
Furthermore, during the subsequent calculation period, all three installations are not last affected due to their age recovery and repair costs to a significant extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant, as a result of a damage, the mechanical ventilation plant had to be replaced.
In the pump plant Welschenkal, the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be taken over for reasons and, at the pond clearing plant, Lopp had to be excavated after almost 20 years of operation of the first clarifier, the clarifier was removed and an additional ventilation facility was built in order to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary expenses, the costs of care and maintenance that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period have been included."
The same applies to electricity costs that were still clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhauser made it clear that in the case of the low rainfall in the three installations, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "completely met".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs in the waste water plants has been eliminated over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be precarious, in the view of Steinhauser, especially if the water supply area of the Friesenbachtal Association cannot be extended to these plants because it is a lack of facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria accounted for 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of July 2016 (compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routines (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users every day to change the reality and to play with identities in a way that is already bound to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are unspoiled, characteristic tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps reach the public.
Snapchat filters have been critical in the past, in which they have been accused of promoting the Blackface app or white skin as an ideal for beauty.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them sharp, false teeth and exposed waves, some critics called it a racist karicature of Asians - "Evil face".
They wondered whether these repeated disputes pointed to a greater problem that the company had diversity.
News and encouragement were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company apologized: the filter was thought to be honoring anime characters and not to be a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism remembered the filter of damaging clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparpani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "damaged and inflexible."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-translation of a very resistant Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowish look has been drawn into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural monument.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats, a large audience of young people - who are different in race matters than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's so much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before the case," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for the media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for the media and in a phone interview, she said that she believed racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's settings practices.
Zhu criticized them for most of the white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
" Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their team so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its staff and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently appointed a staff manager who focused on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management false ISIS secret service information, established by the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to make a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual state on site, a congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Defence Budget Committee, reports of major dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts, who reported changes in their estimates of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting service information, typically derived from high-level Centcom commands, regularly showed a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual state on-the-spot and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government officials have given instructions under Obama to modify the reports, it shows how analysts see themselves exposed to the pressure of their orders to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than they were in line with the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military return to Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressor from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the news service reports to play the risk through ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom report are carried out by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the creation of ISIL news services and Iraqi security services," the high-level Democratic Committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship representative, announced in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Ship, "has delayed the publication of news services reports", damaged morals among analysts and "was too little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had found no evidence of a White House intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "defined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress' findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Inspector General of the Pentagon, which were recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the Inspector General were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have completely divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence."
The investigations have added back effects on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made in the meantime by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The charges of last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls disputes over more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts had only a small population in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government authorities, found that, contrary to the government's statements, there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group on the sale of oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom before
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually be a great performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't belong to people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows this: Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympics and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remain unbeatable.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finale, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group of six teams will each achieve the first and second seats.
The first place will lead the strong Dutch people a little longer away from the path leading to the other group.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising twist through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey baller in her hands (their two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, she became a American national player, the latest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the Cader.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything for her and her team was shaking.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach of the national team, began to change things for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the working income in London that we now have.
We've been able to completely bypass the ruder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a back blow from the vicinity.
India had gone to the game without winning in the tournament, but the team showed a surprising turn and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a splint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and ran the ball into the door to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final door in the middle of the last quarter.
The shootout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. Torhüterin, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a door in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the line of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constantly and unmistakably, a swift strike between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic facade itself would be a burning rod, which is given to the tournament to the triathlet by the armrest to the swimmer.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and is a woman's black with mushrooms, could have been entirely under these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, tournament or even fatter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampolines.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at the same time.
Next to the center, partly in the shade are the sports species that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast-swimming and be able to control it for a long time.
But if I may gently make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it was in Sydney, it has been observed so clearly over the past 16 years that many of those I had asked did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline race and had an athlete until 2012 who won it until the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
The trampoline jumper has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympics.
At this point, I should add that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous nipples of its never to end the desired appeal - but also the grace of the tournament and dive, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Trampolin."
Extensive winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to take a series of falling movements (drills, hooks and saltos) before they land on the feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme after execution, difficulty level and flight time.
Two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will meet in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their quest for gold, medal hopers must move on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but also another honitic goal in the television transmission: the world or the Olympics Code.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I felt to myself when I watched these games as a little tiring.
The trampoline offers an atmosphere.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she goes off, seems as hard as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then tirelessly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no waves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as competition in the Olympics can only be.
The qualifications and finals of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men will also be on Saturday at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general Tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the indication and objectiveization of male athletes - as the American male tournaments recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley is expecting his flying, new fan community.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an association of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants calling for political changes in Ethiopia stood in violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that during the clash with the police, protestors were killed at gunpoints.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong association of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests have spread over the country against the government and spread in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen were shooting and killing unarmed demonstrators.
Be on the move about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handhold against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently been under pressure by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed, or driven to the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and have no other options but to protest, it will break out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central thiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the election in relation to the power of the governing coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rose along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this poignant, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Ogaden Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could use turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of irritation are now exploding under the surface after years.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxyes that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharus, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharus are not natural enemies.
Since Aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia from most Christian high countries, have flourished in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that also changes just now.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the territories of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharic and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is inexorably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigris, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say he was particularly versed in it to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special commanders to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relatively impartial reasons to adopt the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigris.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopians experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been embroiled and then stolen by the government.
During the subsequent raids, many Protestants were killed, even though they were less than in the last few months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal dissatisfaction of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous form of ethnicity.
Last month, Protestants in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tiger, and hate against Tigers is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a separate position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin grass migration."
Donald Trump claims that Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by indicating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State, not seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate with the American public and understandably.
It also brings his fellows who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the actual position, to explain statements he could not even have meant.
After he had made the adjudication at a election event in the middle of the afternoon, Mr. Trump ran back on Thursday's claim and was in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he was serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump weaken his statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism struck Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he took strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to draw back to the need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, where appropriate, "clear" depending on how the reaction goes." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smarter enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of cutting off the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more intense tone, as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics for distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been focusing his attention on the past few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's Scherze has brought his loyal fellows into the uncomfortable situation to him, no matter how challenging his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent public speakers, worked hard to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is in this sense true that before Obama ISIS was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called them backbankers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by submitting to the situation aggressively under control in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and suggested to them to prepare for each of his words and to be taken forward against him.
He prevented the "poor, evil" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats complained about Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the president's office.
Once priced by the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where only a bar could be paid, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Chargefront were reduced.
Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals believed it as the last loss in a self-gentle city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is out and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new one.
A relabelled Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar light atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot to do.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with speck and cheese and there are guarantees such as caps and savored wreaths.
There are natural travel escorts.
The café no longer serves beer, so there are fresh dishes.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a constant stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also forced by Williamsburg's prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee pot for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea that is another new addition instead of her usual Iced Coffee.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-term and trusted customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss bag watch and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bad with Speck, Egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't care that the soap business took over the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb with the cold-rolled coffee of the café as a ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get on her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to expose them soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the frozen coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands on a nearby building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribal art and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the hall and ordering a new coffee like a home trip felt.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taste, President Roosevelt had a weak for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Swim Soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a flower pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Your husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was from the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A Steadfast Meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, wireless imbis in Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthhan with potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Reliable foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was a breakdown of soil, liver cheese and bone fracture.
They were prepared from a container and something billiards that stretch the container.
Imagine eating so much vegetables that they serve them as dinners.
Coe's grinning.
"It must have been in the stomach like a flower," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" shows the ways with which the country moved no longer to be the slender country.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense topic," Coe said, "why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was strained: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles became basic foods, the casherole as "wonderful way to restore food remains," Ziegelman noted, since the kitchen could hide unpredictable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of the American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Specific mixtures were tested as a calorie rich and nourishing preference for taste or even healthy taste.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, baked twins with groundnut butter.
"There was no popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Soil butter and ground wreaths do not match.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economics - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics - have driven on the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and to be fair to the challenge of turning cotton like creamy spaghetti into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of the historic beauties.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuch-Kuch-Kushen-Hungary.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millions of heavy men of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurken sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and brought a smoking.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the maintenance of a housekeeper with no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trustworthy prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to deal with food, were rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.
The temptation lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
In writing the book, the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "They actually made people sick."
There was the windmill accident.
After the plates were emptied at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumbing dessert, President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a good name.
There was no saffron, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water, and lime.
Each of them deliberately tapped a pencil in the teeth, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe took a three-time turn.
Like a Can-Do-Budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
Killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a phase bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to the image division, so far saved the lives of almost 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers put their own lives at stake to draw people out of demolished houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue from the drummers of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the acid to the shining figure in the grey of the war.
However, as heroes he never saw himself, he said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself suffered an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four beam bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
One woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breath.
"We now eliminate the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrae animal is almost 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland haie usually only comes to the surface in winter.
This shark was able to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland haie is only 150 years of age.
The Greenland hai swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres.
Only when it comes up, the five-metre animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km/h - and is at this maximum speed half as fast as a robot.
This life-style marked by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland hai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolution biologists have long suspected that Greenland hai will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland hai are difficult to observe, and finally they live mainly in the iceberg before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures to the six degrees Celsius, they are usually on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie accordingly.
They measure their timetime tempo when they equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Nevertheless, this shark is made: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robot, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the esophagus, and look for cadaver, which from higher water layers to dry down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hai, which fish caught in the waters of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens cores of the shark.
This center of the eyelid is already formed before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had apparently a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons trials increased the amount of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal, the lens anchors included a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all the larger green sharks had normal carbon-14 in their lens cores, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-hour for a 493 centimeters long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hai with 502 centimeters may even be 392 years old.
The greenlandhai weibchen was known only when they were more than four meters long.
Now the length researchers were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is likely to be on the threshold for sexual intercourse and its age has been determined at 156 years, Greenland haie with the increase can be seen for at least one and a half centuries.
This should also be a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such non-salems live mainly in effluent waters is not a coincidence.
The former record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in which a 120-year-old harpoon tip lay on its neck, was caught in front of Alaska.
Because of the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often on fire.
So they mature later - and ages slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Double-Packing Background
Topics on construction have been a major concern for the municipality during the recent meeting.
With relief, the board took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of newly designated residential areas can finally begin".
After clarification of the issues of land, parceling and disposal and applications for measurement, the sale of land in the residential areas of "straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - Ext. 1) is no longer in the way of stakeholders.
The municipal council is convinced that the shelters in the rural and quiet residential municipality of Schönau address young families and quiet seniors alike.
As it was called, construction volunteers can report immediately to the Council, the municipality is expected to be consulted at its September meeting on the award of the parcels.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises linked to the creation of jobs, the municipality decided to amend the area use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the field of sub-timers, the area of trade already shown there is extended by two parcelen direction Statestraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and businesses that have been left out of London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from Brexit's vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the field of competence Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether houses can continue to operate from London from financial businesses across the EU.
For the so-called EU passports, they still have authorisation in Britain.
That's what big U.S. banks just use.
Several banks have already announced leaving jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the EIOPA European Insurance Supervisor and the ESRB Risk Framework.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigttland.
Although Luxembourg was home to a large fund industry, Dublin was also worse off in infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the large airport.
Also points the city with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtland says.
In addition, the rentals for first-class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate advice, the city stood on the ground seven, Luxembourg on the ground 19, Dublin on the ground 33 and Paris on the 37th floor.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IW follows.
In spite of the Brexit vote, however, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
This is also the case: In London, according to the number of Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, about 144,000 people in the banking sector, in Frankfurt, there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim to reimbursement of the costs incurred by the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merck patents, which were linked to the Blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US leader discovered a pattern of Merck’s misconduct, including meineid and other unethical actions.
On Thursday's hearing, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had a claim to the cost of defending the case.
Merck is trying to get to Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck claimed ownership of laboratory work, which is based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained complete control of Manbí from the Islamic state
U.S.-supported troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbí near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city left it, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) marched through the city after the expulsion of the remaining group of fighters who had been buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manbi Military Council of Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are conducting cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published his tax statement on Friday for 2015, this award for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband income of USD 10,75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34,2%.
In 2015, the Clintons spent USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton produced almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster magazine for her book over her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements together with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a striking contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false statements and returnees in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by laws because of them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," Clinton's election assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 in the middle of Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to raise questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business districts and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump did not pay any or only very little taxes during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a regulation, named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for buff fat, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax check and Trump had "Angst" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign published a tax statement back in 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax statement of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wages, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and incomes of USD 109 000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, promote fireworks Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox kind of to keep elephants from walking in settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms on those filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea already years ago, has intensified its support with the U.S. Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-stage method to protect their houses and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many muscles have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed this ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, with much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Manager Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a fork and blowing in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "chiliwoke" will be thrown away.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packaged together with a fireworks body in a condom, the end of which is turned to the seal.
When it is lit, the condom inserts a needle and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hook is usually already out to avoid the elephants.
A last possibility is a broadcaster who shoots a gold-ray fire in the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decided unanimously: No Kiosknebau at St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects are carried out by companies with Kusshand - but the retail trade in the city of Kern is considered to be clearly inexhaustible.
However, the City Council has now refused to grant the application for the refurbishment of a shoe shop at the Rhine River in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine-Balcon in the building.
"In principle, we welcome new business operators, but at this location, in an exposed position at the Rhine River, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks down Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots revealed a media riot after he had said that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli preference, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his anxiety at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and destroyed?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this was even more angry in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the selection be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were disappointed and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed to this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater shame.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, with people calling it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "represented" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"All of you," it was said in another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges against itself and called the case a "fate" and "accused" at Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.
"There was never a direct direction," Israel did not include in the fast election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police set up Tränengas & Gummieschosses against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police set up gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading to the police using rubber boots and gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protestors were seen staring at the walls of the former President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators in Massen went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarian, the trade rate between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.
Since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran, the Russian company's interest in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassadors said.
Russian companies are developing existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarian said.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boost was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
This year, Dzhagarianan is dating from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, were issued to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Testimony sought: drinking market in forest bröl
A robbery occurred on Thursday night on the drinking market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gun, three darkly dressed persons who suspected their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the drinking market and then flew on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW floor.
The police don't share with you how much money was valued.
The workers should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is immediately accessible and poorly visible from the rewe market's deck.
After the accident in Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the shooters must have escaped with the silver-colored car, possibly in direction B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (by 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery must report to the police urgently.
Nagold: game and fun in summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Child Protection League Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In a quiet holiday home Hardwäldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school.
Several full-time trips were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the strike zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group experienced much about the daily and feeding of the Kelten.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which included jumping, swimming and planning.
Culinary children and caregivers with their own prepared body food, such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seabronner Pfänlle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübininger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or from wood produced a Roman milling game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bonte evening".
On the day of the return home, the sun and the children and young people returned happy home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the Forth of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch unit of the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way to a four-day pilgrimage from Villelingen to Freiburg.
Four steps have been taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwalfhart of all ministers in the expected two years, the St. Anna High Minister has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special goal was offered with the fort of mercy opened to it at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and St.
Earlier in the evening, Pfarrer Storost sent out the Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cross and distributed the Pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villelingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady Love is standing, and so the pilgrimage came from the Münster.
The individual daily tours were framed every morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.
But the minis on field crosses, chapels, or churches made a song of their own composed Pilger-Liedhäft to sing together again and again.
For the nights each parish houses of the local parishes were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful as well as strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went to Gutenbach via Furtwangen.
During the day, the steps to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to be cut off at heavy heat about 500 meters high and then turned off again.
The award was a common barbecue at Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage in Freiburg.
The Minis, apparently relieved and happy, met in the late afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and went through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was blessed here.
In the evening exhibition in Münster, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's goal was welcomed by Co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the Pilgrims were able to visit the priesthood and the high priest.
The next day there was still time for the broadband metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
At the end, all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shote Callum Skinner storms home when British gold reaches for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner ran last night in the men's team-sprint in velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The boy's fist made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships, despite Hoys' retreat.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the sponsor Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a Hindu.
Today's restlessness created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shots that now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who were on Hoy four years ago - and Skinners set up an Olympic chord in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries were on the first round.
And the British Trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was back shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when the Hindus went in a higher direction to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially the Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they went up to the podium.
The 23-year-old scanner from Glasgow said, "It's a ridiculous comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
In the end, we have set up an Olympic chord and won the World Cup.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindus said that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such an amazing victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we will have a successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form of Kennys it is possible that he repeats the Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sports; that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - meant an exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the one from Hoy.
Kenny participates as the next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be shot at the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the target.
The World Record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
He had argued yesterday with the officers before the qualification when he was called by officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team rely on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
The dramas took place in the background, so the retreat of technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobbing projections, as well as the state of rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrum, it looks as if the now legendary call of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of the aluminum blend of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thereby cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the Government's decision in early Victoria this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A grant set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.
In addition, there could be effects of domino as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerie, leading last year to a closure of the Anglosea Power Plant.
Alcoa’s melting pot in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years-long speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium blender with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company told.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were "security business" which would have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month deadline to end 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasting of the high-term markets for wholesale electricity.
AGL reported that it has already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion amounting to $187 million in the "Awaiting an Termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the "ability to operate Alcoas... the melting process or to ensure electricity supply to the melting process" was not detrimental.
The US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it was still guilty of a declaration of why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn against possible closure of the Portland Melselzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the bad economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of analysts early in the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If both installations were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [current market].
And for us as power generators, it wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and was on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people that I love, I got the view of this cover for wine," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian genre family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz corner and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how she forgot the cover of her sister and ended up with a classic change: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-related action almost every birthday episode of a child sending (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a sign-trip on a post at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat up the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With an extent that is more like a video tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertising operators (according to fashionistas were from the 832 pages of the wall 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his coverstars is expected to be so seductive that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been preserved before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "labellings that model" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-Pricer and Dior-Marken Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as her generation's "breakdown model", falls under the previous category, is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything happens to girls).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the single Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mystery of the moment."
These feelings were cooked up again when the message with the appearance of the genres came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to pass the point to ride on the wrong path.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective payall apps.
She sells pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure she is to see in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and her children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid beneficiaries are rejected by the Community law centres each year, while the sector focuses on the effects of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, relief workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delogations and similar - will be denied free legal advice and legal assistance on their claims.
Legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal resources.
The Director of Community Law Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that the last survey of the National Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without a repeal of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Advocate General and the Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to remove these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and that the Government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump campaigned after employees allegedly pulled weapons
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of an alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had sent a gun to an employee in February while they were on their way to a jeep in February.
The event is described in an indictment filed in the Court of Justice of Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated that he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "takes a gun, places his right finger on the draw, and hits the run in Vincents Kniekelhe," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons need not be fired in order to cause damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he said a number of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had broken his words from the context and that he would not stop the violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the breach of the duty of care and from Philip due to bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not able to deliver an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local messenger in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is called Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey of Land-Wahlen: Loss of SPD and CDU
The upcoming elections in the Federal Republic of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This presented representative inquiries from the INSA Institute of Opinion for the "Image" section (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible after the survey in Berlin.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is intertwined between the left and the AFD.
The left came to 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AFD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
In spite of a slight loss of 6 per cent (before 8.7 per cent), the greens return to the Black Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day by 3 percent each.
At the Berlin House of Representatives' election, the SPD of the survey is only 23 per cent (2011 elections: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are thus still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AFD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry instead of 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty cool.
The built-in storage was at the beginning eight megabytes, which would now be rich for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came into the business on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer show Cebit in Hanover as "Office in Western Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot of texts and e-mails for those standards, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even the access to web sites was possible through HTML browsers, even though it was very slow.
A pocket computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be hit like a laptop.
Then they found a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.
The average selling price for a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could deny in August 1996 that the communicator of the beginning of the smartphone era would become.
Since then, everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone-part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, finally sold and developed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, this is today for a lot of people every day.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
For sale about 1.4 billion devices, only 555 million pieces have been sold on Samsung and Apple.
The worldwide turnover of equipment is around 400 billion euros.
In this way, the well-functioning business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications group.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has been created.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market began in 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to use everything easily via touch screen.
Apple's win start, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the insight.
You finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
They now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-understanding 20 years after its invention.
In the cut today, every German looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to even put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, in Siemens's staff position.
At the same time, permanent accessibility is considered to be a race and a blessing.
England has to link the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the greatest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in scientific growth and to increase the capacity and employment to leave both the airport and the whole of GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which has been chosen five years from the world's best airport terminal until T2, which has been built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time to link this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and secure our future trade and create an abundance of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretariat to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse" about Ad Blocking
For companies that earn online money, according to one of the software manufacturers, try to run a display block, a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post that announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook reported that his desktop page would change the encoding of his ads to make it difficult to identify the part of the advertising page.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post the speakers of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-combat between the ad-blocking open source community and the converter has been on the move since the invention of ad-block blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using advertising blockers worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile end devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company saw it on display blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile display blockers had no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker shared with them.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a large proportion of the revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a pay value.
On Tuesday Facebook reported that it would update its "Advertising Preferencestool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks' new filter would be worrying, because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so instead we have focused on developers tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of people.
Go to Swiss highway in case of alleged suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was transferred on Thursday to a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman in the dark "in an act of despair" was on the road and was hit by several cars," the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been recognized, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who call on them and any witnesses of the incident to report.
Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that a "logical" step in such a situation was opened.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
This is something that the prosecutor must decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In either case - in which a person was in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer of the fugitive killing was released after she had passed over and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night at the A1 near Payer.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court found out.
The court found that the policemen -- who had responded to an emergency -- ran in a just manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
The Venus was probably once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere could once have shown similar conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere and yet slowly moved on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid pollution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent higher.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-to-day site of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rain screen to shield the surface from a large part of solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those on earth today.
The model presented a story of Venus, similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably inhabited, Venus -- over the years over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned out of ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen developed, there was only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly tree effect -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking for a new coach immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
I've been thinking for a long time about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to those of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who was quoted by Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanche 2013-14, Roy was awarded the best coach of the League as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the association to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches listed a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, stop strikes
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all the parties put themselves at the table for a new round of talks, said the negotiator.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the United and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of settlement of the current struggle," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-time sessions in the next few weeks, which will begin next year in order to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that your last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's interest rate follows a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through market losses.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and has announced plans to stop its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business as a result of its mega-consumption with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw oil prices, an economic situation which had been strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the constellations of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the constellations of the Pleiades.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why stars rotate at the start of the star at different rates and in what context are the rotation times with the rise of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system by comparing our results with other stars," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this constellation, which occurred some 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these giant stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- like sun spots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slow pirouettes as smaller.
"In the "ballet" of the pleas we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebul said.
There is much more to us than we want to learn more about how to slow down their rotation rates, when and why stars hang their dance shoes.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial Baseball Star begins
The tears flow faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. Baseball star in the best days of Base to base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the Tampa Bay Rays tricot of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Trimal was chosen Rodriguez as the most valuable player in the League, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract protected him from 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, it will function as a consultant and youth coach - at full cost.
As a player it paid Rodriguez a long time back with power.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005, he made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be included in the baseball room.
Because so successful Rodriguez - the name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so contesting his appearance is outside the space.
Already in 2009 the Superstar at "ESPN" added to take steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was shut down for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect for years through an anti-agging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the gap was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League could have even made me a case for 2014, because I spent 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said suffizant at the time.
Also, his divorce days do not run smoothly.
While many baseball legends in their last games were getting the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankee Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actor Cameron Diaz and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson, was followed by sympathy comments from the fans of the Yankee-Erzrhrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at 4:9 a.m. on the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Obtained: Due to a positive doping test, weightmaker Adrian Zielinski must not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A acquired athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polishweight Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the uncritical lightweight athletic competitions, these messages come to an unprecedented stage.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, has already been demonstrated on the last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmetterling, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have been expected to take part in the preamble over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B trials and for a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CAS and accept the judgment".
The first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the message about the positive test at Danekowa was assured, and the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is intended to act on the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B samples should also be positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately reported on criticism of the Athletics.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, for example, all body weights from the chronic doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday was also known the case "Adrian Zielinski", the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both fight the intake, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Prior to the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had prevented the start of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, as well as the Laufernazion Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the previous events in China also provided for strong disputes between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang Harsch.
"Sun that pink purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of frestil, I want to give up," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping bets," he said.
Sun was tested in 2014 in the Chinese championships positively on the stimulant trimetazidin, but only a three-month suspension had to be removed.
Key of Data: Hacker so faithfully pressed their money
Developers of Expressing malware are currently targeting targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey by the Malware defence specialists, 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany had at least 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the last 12 months, partly the victims of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target of a ransomware eerpression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the damages required by the victims in order to re-use the systems and data that were attacked.
The perpetrators specialize in their Erpresser software according to the observation of malware bytes in view of attacks in corporate networks.
If it succeeds there, the potentially pressing ransom money falls significantly higher than that of private users.
"We are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in a conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then, the perpetrators discovered themselves as an expressive software.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months intimidatingly.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it aims at recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as files of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original sustainable.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the bitcoin crypto currency.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are looking for sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is stopped.
Therefore, the damage is higher if a ransomware is added.
22% of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13% even had to stop the business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospital victims have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of disease.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for the manager to reject the demand of the perpetrators, given the state of the operation.
The hackers know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure's security researchers have investigated the user surfaces and the contact with the pushers and come to the result: In fact, the offenders are trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, direct freely available support websites to or otherwise unlock example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private persons have to be redeemed, companies have to trade part-time and pay five-fold sums to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware expression, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software building box to the actual predators.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"In the range of delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The rappers then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logins in one of the forums in the background, buys the set from a criminal and orders another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Criminals usually then command spammer with distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT-responsors in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to reject ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the workers are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the potential for damage according to the type of data is even more numerous than before.
In the future, the workers could also take up a completely new goal on the Internet of things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the freezing of such a blocked heat could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If, instead of heating in the future, the operators block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the diversity of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is in fact proved to be very flexible every day.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work at any place.
The materials in the interior are well-processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top is slightly down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the stauraum.
There is not only a box space of 453 l for high and 1026 l for covered back loans, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the backbase can climb up like a kinosassel and thus offer a stauraum, which is from the ground to the roof of 1.24 m.
The trunk can be loaded well, however, the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotary ranges very powerful.
However, he should do some quieter work.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l gasoline with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the drive should be something more direct.
The equipment does not allow the "Executive" option to be opened in the tested top option.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracer.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "recalling objects" when ranking.
Very reliable, the remote-light assistant works.
And the smart tempo regulation reacts to traffic sign recognition and drains speed when needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI books are under the armpit and are therefore somewhat accessible.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive petrol from 200000 euros, diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline does not hang: Sturt on airtight bridge
An airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the airport bridge.
Because only a liability is likely to be considered in the case of hazards typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a hard drive at the storm.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, so the Court of Justice.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When the organizer pays
The sick vacationers will only be paid back after their trip only if the cause of the disease is no doubt found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely affected by a break-in on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost all her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective treatment plant, which was supposed to have polluted the seawater.
The family was the view that the trip had been indiscriminate and complained against the organizers.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
Although the clearing was actually defective.
However, the organizer only experienced the withdrawal of the complaints.
He had to get out of the sea so far that the water was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
When no impurities were found in the samples of water.
The illness of several hotel guests - perhaps by interfering with each other - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State must identify and respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Surely our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be won by the terrorists.
If criminals were to leave the country faster, however, it would increase security and also strengthen the people's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the 2017 Federal Election Day.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle quadrilateral order over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism has to be punished again.
Video surveillance should improve, the law of arms will be so revitalized that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be difficult.
The last much debated obligation for doctors should be kept in line with the words of the Maizières.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of the citizens, he said with a view to mental illness.
In order to counter radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
For the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made himself clear against activism.
"This was an earring for the sharpmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the news of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full disclosure is considered to be a constitutional problem.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules in road transport or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he always want to simulate action and ability with new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-Party Bernd Riexinger said: "Flow speech and strengthening of the right of residence no longer brings security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It stands regularly on the surrounding street - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the legal challenge is to be extended.
This is a good message for all car drivers who stand in the road of the environment every night when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16th) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Weseler Street, the law-enforcement trail is extended by 700 metres.
Drivers can then directly dock from the Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage: Transport is growing early, which improves the overall flow of traffic on the multi-purpose section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the districts represented Münster-West.
The train ride on the trailer is particularly nerved by the drivers between 17 and 19 hours.
Workdays reach back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From this point on, traffic is only unilaterally pushed over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well into twenty-four years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required carrying force to double the load traffic in particular.
As long as this engpass and the associated working time will last, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated with years: because the bridge has an official rest period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal dispute, the country company has deliberately chosen the poor time in school because it has to deal with obstacles.
Transport is carried over by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural trip: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theater "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theater are now planning a music project.
Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the boy's Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural trip" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students visited the stage between eleven and 15 years of age in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has targeted the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, so the press release of the boy Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from language, and the young theater will be working together in the next play time in a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to visit professionally trained courses in the fields of singing, dancing, play and music.
Offerings for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rains instead of storms: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-snake-guckers in southwestern Germany a stretch of the bill on Friday night - but there is hope.
The night was bad because of the clouds and rains to watch the sky, the president of the Star Warte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is at night for Saturday.
The weather's supposed to be good, then we're sure to see a lot of stars in the sky.
The star jumps are perpages, which are one of the fastest star jumps with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the Northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from thinking of sleep before the weekend bell.
It's all different than relaxing.
At the same time, you are in good company with such problems: according to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel sleepless.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be a variety of reasons for them, says Hans-Günter Weß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand on the ground below is, but the insomnia, that is, a breakdown of sleep and sleep.
In particular, many people felt unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Netherlands.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Afterwards, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be added, but also medications.
Often, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially common in a depression," Weßs says.
And it may be that different factors are bonding.
For example, someone who has a tape record may be ill, wakes up every two to three hours, and starts to talk about everyday problems and concerns, gives a good example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you sleep with your doctor?
Anyone who is not well asleep for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Wess.
The impact may seem quite different: you are beaten, tired, unsleeped, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easy to react, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
It is important to identify the causes of sleep disorder.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
In Germany there is hardly a low level of sleep medicine, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in the case of sleep problems, you should first turn to the doctor, advise Weß.
It can be investigated whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the bedroom, and what's going on?
For the study in the bedroom, physicians recommend, for example, in snorkeling with respiratory dissertations, in patients who are sick, in sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains the exercise.
In fact, you don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't just sleep in the middle of the day," says Vietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a noseglass, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the roof shows the sleepers.
How can those affected get the trouble in the grip?
There are quite a lot of post-mortem screws to which you can apply for a better sleep.
Weeds count: Regular sleep and uptime, not too long lying in bed, not sleeping on the day, not sleeping on TV, drinking and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is totally and not encouraging.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Debelr has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had collected gold for the first time in Doha at the World Cup and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Debelr has been protecting himself from his former teammates who are critical of him via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on Friday night on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sport is bad, but doping checks are very good.
So we cannot compete with countries that are very supportive and do not look so closely at the topic or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, the Devil had to have been notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly how countries should be treated.
"Those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM/OS by independent WADA/FINA controllers may not participate," asks the election Hamburger, who currently operates an ice component.
Airport: Gang of luggage deeps arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, Düsseldorf police civilians arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had gone into several pockets and bags as gangs.
By 21.30 a.m., civilian officials in Düsseldorf Airport again recognized a band known to police officers from past thefts.
Since mid-July, the two women and two men have had several delicacys and have been engaged in community-wide, labour-intensive and particularly professional activities.
The Specialists of the Office of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had been sent to Germany to commit crimes.
They had spent more than 15,000 euros in it.
Altbouten, a few Linden trees, by the way another headstone patch: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count it as the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go along the road from East to West, you get to playgrounds, a freshly carved children's garden and a bio-load.
On the façade of a grey house, someone has sprayed "hospitality!".
Against a member who is about to be destroyed, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.
Article on this "trend city" as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, however, is preferably represented in the last few weeks by burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor still have rooms and are used for events.
In particular, since the beginning of the year, Berliner Innensenator Henkel has repeatedly spoken of a strong police action against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the rooms on the ground floor, which had been cleared by 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, the rooms were renovated by construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners.
On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the room was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers withdrew under the delight of sympathies and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the stairs in front of the houses in the sun, others have fun in front of Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and children's gardens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the home projects, they share the care of rising rent and genital mutilation.
It doesn't sound like a choice that most police protections have sought against vandalizing leftovers.
The grave, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police set up between houseowners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the East Berlins was a traditional working district, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
Houses and their native residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near the Rigar.
While the mains were located under a large police offer in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former houseowners share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly carved facades, which have been cast with dyes.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year together with the words "Linksautonome Violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal acts such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed at policemen.
Most of the criminal acts are causing damage to the case, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94, there can be no doubt about this.
As for violent people, it is overwhelming: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer in the Rigar.
For the studied architects, their street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than from anywhere else."
New building is deliberately pulled into the Riga Street - and remained.
That was why it was so important for the inhabitants to return to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the height of dedication to the city in July.
But in the eyes of inhabitants like new buildings, the road will continue to be taken away from them: through invisible new buildings in former buildings that oppress the old inhabitants.
"These are finally property apartments that are not interesting to many here - rather people who are not so well known here," she says.
"Governing and destruction, I can't be good at it."
But what should you do if someone never hears?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs: The house projects and the left scenes belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of it - just like someone who drags himself into a kneading area, there can be a bad feeling about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Sozialpädagogin supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It is seen as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working circle Refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working circuit indicates that the honoraries are more than grateful that Bogichle is now there, the generous wool millsau, which has a problem in particular.
In this way, some - less ridiculously than most - had been aiming at the number of areas that were desirable - when the administration wanted to assign the post.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, as well as an ovaries of wool.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been on it for about six weeks.
She's frozen a 50-percent job for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and top-level actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers are soon on the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The costs of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the Land Council to municipalities and workplaces.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, if you're pointing to private apartments, so Dioschle.
Therefore, community apartments must be fooled, as it is called.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it's not just with apartments.
Perspective is the word, Regina customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a solid record, there are practical places, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regina customer.
Many work in the building or help house masters, perform non-profit work - and that motivates and is very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That's "no employment therapy".
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, they say Deuschle and customer.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, the administration and the honorary are coming in.
It is central that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes just a little while and they can easily overrun time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who ever develops the feeling could not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, which will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honest, "People who don't even have anything to do." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
That's all a mom job.
A difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalisation after the latest events, even in a small town like Urbach?
"No," says Regina customer very clearly, "what some may call naive." A risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helper is already sensitive.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the attackers would bring them to a complete end.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main officials must look at activities on the spot and in the region.
They always have the background that a new shock could soon come to Urbach on refugees and migrants.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is at stake.
In fact, it is not fair to place them on site.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we can," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbanists are already out of the way to integrate the people so far.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schordorf: Breakers sought with helicopter
For about an hour, the police raider ran out of several areas.
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multifamily house on the Lindenway on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and threw the innkeepers into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both brought bluejeans and black capuzenpuli.
